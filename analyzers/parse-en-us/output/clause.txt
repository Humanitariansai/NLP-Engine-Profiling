noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat

active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria
active:  It is in a German-speaking country
noverb:  in Bohemia
noverb:  not far from Carlsbad
noverb:  Remarkable
active:  being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Hum
novoice: Born in New Jersey in the year 1858
noverb:  Contralto
noverb:  hum
noverb:  La Scala
noverb:  hum
noverb:  Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw
noverb:  yes
passive: Retired from operatic stage
noverb:  ha
noverb:  Living in London
noverb:  quite
noverb:  Your Majesty
active:  I understand
active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered
active:  We have tried and failed
active:  Your Majesty must pay
passive: It must be bought
active:  She will not sell
noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him
noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked
noverb:  Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue
noverb:  St. John's Wood
active:  Holmes took a note of it
noverb:  One other question
active:  said he
noverb:  Was the photograph a cabinet
active:  It was
noverb:  good-night, your Majesty
active:  I trust
active:  we shall soon have some good news for you
noverb:  And good-night
noverb:  Watson
active:  he added
active:  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day
noverb:  returns at seven sharp for dinner
active:  Seldom goes out at other times
active:  she sings
active:  Has only one male visitor
noverb:  a good deal of him
active:  He is dark
noverb:  handsome, and dashing
active:  never calls less than once a day
noverb:  often twice
active:  He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton
noverb:  of the Inner Temple
active:  See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline
noverb:  moustached
noverb:  evidently the man of

active:  He appeared
active:  to be in a great hurry
passive: shouted to the cabman
active:  to wait
passive: brushed past the maid
active:  opened the door with the air of a man
active:  was thoroughly at home
active:  He was in the house about half an hour
active:  I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
noverb:  pacing up and down
noverb:  talking excitedly
active:  waving his arms
noverb:  Of her I could see nothing
active:  Presently he emerged
noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear

active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived
active:  I paid the man
active:  hurried into the church
active:  There was not a soul
active:  there save the two
active:  I had followed
noverb:  a surpliced clergyman

active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced

noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable

active:  It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me

noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely

active:  I saw the beautiful creature against

noverb:  And
active:  it would be the blackest treachery
noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought
active:  we are not injuring her

active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another
active:  Holmes had sat up upon the couch
active:  I saw him motion
noverb:  a man
active:  is in need of air
novoice: A maid rushed across

active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing

active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now

noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost

active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself

noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary

active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar

active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria
active:  It is in a German-speaking country
noverb:  in Bohemia
noverb:  not far from Carlsbad
noverb:  Remarkable
active:  being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes

passive: Retired from operatic stage
noverb:  ha
noverb:  Living in London
noverb:  quite
noverb:  Your Majesty
active:  I understand
active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered
active:  We have tried and failed
active:  Your Majesty must pay
passive: It must be bought
active:  She will not sell
noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom

noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries

active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual

noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men

active:  you will know all

active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter

noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea

noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street

active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes

active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced

noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now
active:  he said as
active:  he turned hungrily on the simple fare

noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable
active:  he said

novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me
active:  That is excellent
active:  I think, perhaps,
active:  it is almost time

active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought

active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room

noverb:  us nor the photograph
active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up
active:  we shall have a clear field
noverb:  Besides
active:  we must be prompt
noverb:  , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
active:  I must wire to the King without delay
active:  We had reached Baker Street
active:  had stopped at the door
active:  He was searching his pockets for the key
active:  someone passing said
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes
active:  There were several people on the pavement at the time
novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.
active:  I slept at Baker Street that night
passive: we were engaged upon our toast
noverb:  coffee in the morning
active:  the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
active:  You have really got it
active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters
active:  We descended and started off once
noverb:  for Briony Lodge
passive: Irene Adler is married
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to
active:  To an English lawyer named Norton
active:  she could not love him
active:  I am in hopes
active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made
active:  He relapsed into a moody silence
passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight
active:  Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
noverb:  tore back a small sliding shutter
active:  plunging in his hand
novoice: pulled out a photograph and a letter
active:  The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
passive: the letter was superscribed to
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
passive: Esq. To be left till called for
noverb:  My friend tore it open
noverb:  we all three read it together
passive: It was dated at midnight of the preceding night
active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged
active:  I keep it only
active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain
noverb:  dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Very truly yours
noverb:  IRENE NORTON
noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman
active:  cried the King of Bohemia
noverb:  we had all three read this epistle
active:  Did I not tell you
noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King
active:  nothing could be more successful
active:  I know
active:  her word is inviolate
active:  The photograph is now
active:  it were in the fire
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear your Majesty
active:  say
active:  I am immensely indebted
noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand
active:  Your Majesty has something
active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  I.
noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria
active:  It is in a German-speaking country
noverb:  in Bohemia
noverb:  not far from Carlsbad
noverb:  Remarkable
active:  being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see

active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered
active:  We have tried and failed
active:  Your Majesty must pay
passive: It must be bought
active:  She will not sell
noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him
noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked
noverb:  Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue
noverb:  St. John's Wood
active:  Holmes took a note of it
noverb:  One other question
active:  said he
noverb:  Was the photograph a cabinet
active:  It was
noverb:  good-night, your Majesty
active:  I trust
active:  we shall soon have some good news for you
noverb:  And good-night
noverb:  Watson
active:  he added
active:  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day
noverb:  returns at seven sharp for dinner
active:  Seldom goes out at other times
active:  she sings
active:  Has only one male visitor
noverb:  a good deal of him
active:  He is dark
noverb:  handsome, and dashing
active:  never calls less than once a day
noverb:  often twice
active:  He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton
noverb:  of the Inner Temple
active:  See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline
noverb:  moustached
noverb:  evidently the man of
active:  I had heard
active:  He appeared
active:  to be in a great hurry
passive: shouted to the cabman
active:  to wait
passive: brushed past the maid
active:  opened the door with the air of a man
active:  was thoroughly at home
active:  He was in the house about half an hour
active:  I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
noverb:  pacing up and down
noverb:  talking excitedly
active:  waving his arms
noverb:  Of her I could see nothing
active:  Presently he emerged
noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up
active:  she shot out of the hall door
noverb:  into it
active:  I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment
active:  she was a lovely woman
noverb:  with a face
active:  a man might die for
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
noverb:  John
active:  she cried
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  This was quite too good
active:  to lose
noverb:  Watson
active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind
active:  My cabby drove fast
noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster
active:  the others were there
noverb:  us
active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived
active:  I paid the man
active:  hurried into the church
active:  There was not a soul
active:  there save the two
active:  I had followed
noverb:  a surpliced clergyman
active:  seemed
active:  to be expostulating with them
active:  They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar
active:  I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler
active:  has dropped into a church
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my surprise
active:  the three at the altar faced round to me
active:  Godfrey Norton came running
active:  he could towards me
noverb:  Thank God
active:  he cried
active:  You'll do
active:  Come
active:  Come
active:  I asked
active:  Come
noverb:  man
active:  come
noverb:  only three minutes
noverb:  it won't be legal
active:  I was half-dragged
noverb:  up to the altar
active:  I knew
noverb:  I was I found myself mumbling responses
passive: were whispered in my ear
active:  vouching for things of
active:  I knew nothing
active:  generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler
noverb:  spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor
active:  It was all
active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced
novoice: It looked as
active:  the pair might take an immediate departure
active:  necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part
active:  At the church door, however, they separated
noverb:  he driving back to the Temple
noverb:  she to her own house
active:  I shall drive out in the park at five as usual
active:  she said
active:  she left him
active:  I heard no
active:  They drove away in different directions
active:  I went off
active:  to make my own arrangements
active:  are
noverb:  Some cold beef and a glass of beer
active:  he answered
active:  ringing the bell
active:  I have been too busy
active:  to think of food
active:  I am likely
noverb:  to be busier still this evening
noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now
active:  he said as
active:  he turned hungrily on the simple fare
active:  our landlady had provided
active:  I must discuss it
active:  I eat
noverb:  for I have not much time
active:  It is nearly five
noverb:  now
active:  In two hours we must be on the scene of action
noverb:  Miss Irene
noverb:  Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven
active:  We must be at Briony Lodge
active:  to meet her
noverb:  And
active:  You must leave

active:  may
active:  You understand
active:  I am to be neutral
active:  To do nothing
active:  There will probably be some small unpleasantness
active:  Do not join in
noverb:  it
passive: It will end in my being conveyed into the house
noverb:  Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open
active:  You are to station yourself close
noverb:  to
noverb:  open window
noverb:  Yes
active:  You are to watch me
noverb:  for
active:  I will be visible
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Yes
active:  And when I raise my hand--so--
active:  you will throw into the room
active:  I give you
active:  to throw
active:  will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire
noverb:  You quite follow me
noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable
active:  he said
active:  taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket
active:  It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me
active:  That is excellent
active:  I think, perhaps,
active:  it is almost time
active:  I prepare for the new role
active:  I have
active:  to play
active:  He disappeared into his bedroom
novoice: returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman
noverb:  His broad black hat
noverb:  his baggy trousers
noverb:  his white tie
noverb:  his sympathetic smile
noverb:  general look
active:  peering
active:  benevolent curiosity were
active:  such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled
active:  It was not merely
active:  Holmes changed his costume
noverb:  His expression
noverb:  his manner
active:  his very soul seemed
active:  to vary with every fresh part
active:  he assumed
active:  The stage lost a fine actor
novoice: even as science lost an acute reasoner
active:  he became a specialist in crime
noverb:  It was a quarter past six
active:  we left Baker Street
novoice: it still wanted ten minutes to the hour
active:  we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue
active:  It was already dusk
noverb:  ,
passive: the lamps were just being lighted
active:  we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge
noverb:  waiting for the coming of its occupant
active:  The house was just such as I
active:  had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description
novoice: the locality appeared
active:  to be less private
active:  I expected
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood
passive: it was remarkably animated
active:  There was a group of shabbily dressed men
active:  smoking and laughing in a corner
noverb:  a scissors-grinder with his wheel
noverb:  two guardsmen
active:  were flirting with a nurse-girl
noverb:  several well-dressed young men
active:  were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
active:  You see
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  we paced to
noverb:  fro in front of the house
active:  this marriage rather simplifies matters
active:  The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now
active:  The chances are
passive: she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton
active:  our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess
active:  Now the question is
active:  are we
active:  to find the photograph
noverb:  Where
noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely
active:  she carries it about with her
active:  It is cabinet size
noverb:  Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress
active:  She knows
active:  the King is capable
noverb:  having her waylaid and searched
passive: Two attempts of the sort have already been made
active:  We may take it
active:  she does not carry it about with her
noverb:  Where
noverb:  Her banker or her lawyer
active:  There is
noverb:  double possibility
passive: But I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  Women are naturally secretive
active:  they like to do their own secreting
active:  should she hand it over to anyone else
active:  She could trust her own guardianship
active:  she could not tell
noverb:  indirect
passive: political influence might be brought
active:  to bear upon a business man
noverb:  Besides
active:  remember
active:  she had resolved to use it within a few days
active:  It must be
active:  she can lay her hands upon it
active:  It must be in her own house
passive: it has twice been burgled

noverb:  in an instant the lady
active:  had stepped from her carriage

passive: struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks
active:  Holmes dashed into the crowd
active:  to protect the lady
noverb:  just
active:  he reached her
active:  he gave a cry
active:  dropped to the ground
noverb:  with the blood running freely down his face
active:  At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other
active:  a number of better dressed people
active:  had watched the scuffle without taking part in it
noverb:  crowded in
active:  to help the lady
active:  to attend to the injured man
noverb:  Irene Adler
noverb:  as I will still
active:  call her
active:  had hurried up the steps
active:  she stood

active:  I do not know
passive: he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
active:  he was playing
active:  I know
noverb:  I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
active:  I saw the beautiful creature against
active:  I was conspiring
noverb:  the grace and kindliness with
active:  she waited upon the injured man
noverb:  And
active:  it would be the blackest treachery
noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought
active:  we are not injuring her
active:  We are
active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another
active:  Holmes had sat up upon the couch
active:  I saw him motion
noverb:  a man
active:  is in need of air
novoice: A maid rushed across
noverb:  threw open the window
noverb:  At the same instant I saw him raise his hand
noverb:  at the signal

noverb:  the whole crowd of spectators
noverb:  well dressed
noverb:  ill
noverb:  gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids

noverb:  Fire
active:  Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room
noverb:  out at the open window
active:  I caught a glimpse of rushing figures
noverb:  a moment later the voice of Holmes from
active:  assuring them

active:  to get away from the scene of uproar
active:  He walked swiftly
noverb:  in silence for some few minutes
active:  we had turned down one of the quiet streets

noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  Nothing could
active:  have been better

active:  I know
active:  it is
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you find out

active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery
active:  said he
noverb:  laughing
active:  The matter was perfectly simple
noverb:  You, of course, saw
active:  everyone in the street was an accomplice
active:  They were all engaged for the evening
active:  I guessed as much
active:  the row broke out
active:  I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
active:  I rushed forward
noverb:  fell down
active:  clapped my hand to my face
active:  became a piteous spectacle
active:  It is an old trick
active:  also I could fathom
active:  they carried me in
passive: She was bound
active:  to have me in
active:  else could
active:  she do
noverb:  And into her sitting-room
active:  was the very room
active:  I suspected
active:  It lay between
noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled
active:  to open the window
active:  you had your chance
active:  did
active:  help you
active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a
noverb:  perfectly overpowering impulse
active:  I have more than once taken advantage of it
active:  In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me
noverb:  also in the Arnsworth Castle business
noverb:  A married woman grabs at her baby
noverb:  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box
noverb:  Now
active:  it was clear
noverb:  to me

active:  She was there
noverb:  in an instant
active:  I caught a glimpse of it
active:  she half drew it out
novoice: When I cried out
active:  it was a false alarm
active:  she replaced it
novoice: glanced at the rocket
active:  rushed from the room
active:  I have not seen her
active:  I rose
active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find
noverb:  us nor the photograph
active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up
active:  we shall have a clear field
noverb:  Besides
active:  we must be prompt

noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes

novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.
active:  I slept at Baker Street that night
passive: we were engaged upon our toast
noverb:  coffee in the morning
active:  the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
active:  You have really got it
active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters
active:  We descended and started off once
noverb:  for Briony Lodge
passive: Irene Adler is married
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to
active:  To an English lawyer named Norton
active:  she could not love him
active:  I am in hopes
active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made
active:  He relapsed into a moody silence
passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight
active:  Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
noverb:  tore back a small sliding shutter
active:  plunging in his hand
novoice: pulled out a photograph and a letter
active:  The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
passive: the letter was superscribed to
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes

noverb:  My friend tore it open
noverb:  we all three read it together
passive: It was dated at midnight of the preceding night
active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged
active:  I keep it only
active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain
noverb:  dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Very truly yours
noverb:  IRENE NORTON
noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman
active:  cried the King of Bohemia
noverb:  we had all three read this epistle
active:  Did I not tell you
noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King
active:  nothing could be more successful

active:  her word is inviolate

active:  to hear your Majesty
active:  say
active:  I am immensely indebted
noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand
active:  Your Majesty has something
active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows

noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  I.
noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice

active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe

noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all

noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large

noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier

active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts

noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl

active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see

active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters

active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper

novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought

noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear

active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane

active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him
noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked
noverb:  Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue
noverb:  St. John's Wood
active:  Holmes took a note of it
noverb:  One other question

noverb:  good-night, your Majesty
active:  I trust
active:  we shall soon have some good news for you
noverb:  And good-night
noverb:  Watson
active:  he added
active:  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge

novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open

noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day

noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline

noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up

noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
noverb:  John
active:  she cried
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes

active:  to lose
noverb:  Watson
active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind
active:  My cabby drove fast
noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster
active:  the others were there
noverb:  us
active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived

active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral

active:  I saw the beautiful creature against

noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought

active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another

active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values

active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now

noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost

active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself

active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all
active:  I see
active:  the other answered with the utmost coolness
active:  I fancy
active:  my pal is all right
active:  I see
active:  you have got his coat-tails
noverb:  There are three men waiting for him at the door
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem to have done the thing very completely
active:  I must compliment you
noverb:  And I you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  Your red-headed idea was very new and effective
active:  You'll see your pal again presently
active:  said Jones
active:  He's quicker
active:  climbing down holes
active:  I am
active:  Just hold out
active:  I fix the derbies
active:  I beg
active:  you will not touch me with your filthy hands
active:  remarked our prisoner
active:  the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
active:  You may not be aware
active:  I have royal blood in my veins
active:  Have the goodness, also,
active:  you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please
noverb:  All right
active:  said Jones with a stare and a snigger
noverb:  Well,
active:  would you
noverb:  sir
noverb:  march upstairs
active:  we can get a cab
active:  to carry your Highness to the police-station?
active:  That is better
active:  said John Clay serenely
active:  He made a sweeping bow to the three of us
novoice: walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  we followed them from the cellar
active:  I do not know
active:  the bank can thank you
active:  repay you
active:  There is no doubt
noverb:  that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
active:  have ever come within my experience
active:  I have had one or two little scores of my own
active:  to settle with Mr. John Clay
active:  said Holmes
active:  I have been at some small expense over this matter
active:  I shall expect the bank
active:  to refund
noverb:  beyond
passive: I am amply repaid
active:  having had an experience
active:  is in many ways unique
active:  hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street
active:  it was perfectly obvious
noverb:  from the first
noverb:  the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League
noverb:  the copying of the Encyclopaedia
active:  must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
active:  It was a curious way
active:  managing it
noverb:  , really,
active:  it would be difficult
active:  to suggest a better
active:  The method was no doubt
passive: suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair
active:  The $4 a week was a lure
active:  must draw him
active:  was it to them
active:  were playing for thousands
active:  They put in the advertisement
active:  one rogue has the temporary office
active:  the other rogue incites the man
active:  to apply for it
active:  together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
noverb:  From the time
active:  I heard
active:  of the assistant having come for half wages
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  he had some strong motive
active:  securing the situation
active:  could you guess
active:  the motive was
passive: Had
active:  there been women
noverb:  in the house
active:  I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
active:  , however, was out of the question
noverb:  The man's business was a small one
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in his house
active:  could account for such elaborate preparations
noverb:  such an expenditure
active:  they were at
active:  It must
active:  be something out of the house
active:  could it be
active:  I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography
noverb:  his trick
active:  vanishing into the cellar
noverb:  The cellar
active:  There was the end of this tangled clue
active:  Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant
active:  found
active:  I had
active:  to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London
active:  He was doing something in the cellar
noverb:  something
active:  took many hours a day for months on end
active:  could it be
noverb:  once
active:  I could think of nothing save
active:  he was running a tunnel to some other building
active:  So far I had got
active:  we went to visit the scene of action
active:  I surprised you
active:  beating upon the pavement with my stick
active:  I was ascertaining
novoice: the cellar stretched out in front
noverb:  behind
active:  It was not in front
active:  Then I rang the bell
active:  I hoped
active:  the assistant answered it
active:  We have had some skirmishes
active:  we had never set eyes upon each other before
active:  I hardly looked at his face
active:  His knees were
active:  I wished
active:  to see
noverb:  You must yourself have remarked
noverb:  worn
noverb:  wrinkled
noverb:  stained they were
noverb:  They spoke of those hours
active:  burrowing
active:  The only remaining point was
active:  they were burrowing for
active:  I walked round the corner
active:  saw the City
active:  Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises
active:  felt
active:  I had solved my problem
active:  When you drove home after the concert
active:  I called upon Scotland Yard
noverb:  upon the chairman of the bank directors
noverb:  with the result
active:  you have seen
noverb:  And
active:  could you tell
active:  they would make their attempt to-night
noverb:  ?
active:  I asked
noverb:  Well,
active:  they closed their League offices
active:  was a sign
active:  they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence
noverb:  in other words
active:  they had completed their tunnel
active:  it was essential
noverb:  that they should use it soon
passive: as it might be discovered
passive: the bullion might be removed
active:  Saturday would suit them better
noverb:  any other day
active:  as it would give them two days for their escape
active:  For all these reasons I expected them
active:  to come to-night
active:  You reasoned it out beautifully
active:  I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
active:  It is so long
noverb:  a chain
noverb:  every link rings true
active:  It saved me from ennui
active:  he answered
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Alas
active:  I already feel it closing in upon me
passive: My life is spent in one long effort
active:  to escape from the commonplaces of existence
active:  These little problems help me
active:  to do
noverb:  And
active:  you are a benefactor of the race
active:  said I.
active:  He shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  Well,
active:  perhaps, after all, it is of some little use
active:  he remarked
noverb:  L'homme c'est rien
noverb:  l'oeuvre c'est tout
active:  Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
noverb:  ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on
noverb:  side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street
active:  life is infinitely stranger
noverb:  anything
active:  the mind of man could invent
active:  We would not dare to conceive the things
active:  are really mere commonplaces of existence
active:  we could fly out of that window hand in hand
active:  hover over this great city
active:  gently remove the roofs
noverb:  peep in at the queer things
active:  are going on
noverb:  the strange coincidences
noverb:  the plannings
noverb:  the cross-purposes
noverb:  the wonderful chains of events
noverb:  working through generations
active:  leading to the most outre results
active:  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
noverb:  foreseen conclusions most stale
noverb:  unprofitable
noverb:  And
active:  I am not convinced
noverb:  of it
active:  I answered
noverb:  The cases
active:  come to light
active:  in the papers are
active:  , as a rule, bald enough
noverb:  vulgar enough
active:  We have
active:  in our police reports realism
novoice: pushed to its extreme limits
active:  the result is
passive: it must be confessed
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  artistic
passive: A certain selection and discretion must be used
active:  producing a realistic effect
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  This is wanting in the police report
passive: more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate
noverb:  upon the details
active:  to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
active:  Depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so unnatural as the commonplace
active:  I smiled and shook my head
noverb:  I can quite understand your thinking
active:  I said
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody
passive: is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
passive: you are brought in contact with all
active:  is strange and bizarre
noverb:  here
noverb:  --I picked up the morning paper from the ground--
noverb:  let us put it to a practical test
active:  Here is the first heading upon
active:  I come
noverb:  A husband's cruelty to his wife
active:  There is half a column of print
active:  I know without reading it
active:  it is all
noverb:  perfectly familiar to me
active:  There is, of course, the other woman
noverb:  the drink
noverb:  the push
noverb:  the blow
noverb:  the bruise
noverb:  the sympathetic sister or landlady
active:  The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
active:  said Holmes
active:  taking the paper
active:  glancing his eye down it
active:  This is the Dundas separation case
active:  it happens
passive: I was engaged
active:  clearing up some small points in connection with it
active:  The husband was a teetotaler
active:  there was no other woman
active:  the conduct complained
active:  was
active:  he had drifted into the habit
active:  winding up every meal
active:  taking out his false teeth
active:  hurling them at his wife
active:  you will allow
active:  is not an action likely
active:  to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller
active:  Take a pinch of snuff
noverb:  Doctor
active:  acknowledge
active:  I have scored over
noverb:  you in your example
active:  He held out his snuffbox of old gold
noverb:  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
active:  Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life
active:  I could not help
active:  commenting upon it
noverb:  Ah
active:  said he
active:  I forgot
active:  I had not seen you for some weeks
active:  It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
noverb:  And the ring
active:  I asked
active:  glancing at a remarkable brilliant
active:  sparkled upon his finger
active:  It was from the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  the matter in
active:  I served
active:  them was of such delicacy
active:  I cannot confide it even to you
active:  have been good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my little problems
active:  And have you any on hand just now
active:  I asked with interest
noverb:  Some ten
noverb:  twelve
noverb:  none
active:  present any feature of interest
active:  They are important
active:  you understand
novoice: being
active:  interesting
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I have found
active:  it is usually in unimportant matters
active:  there is a field
noverb:  for the observation
noverb:  for the quick analysis of cause and effect
active:  gives the charm to an investigation
active:  The larger crimes are apt
active:  to be the simpler
noverb:  for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive
noverb:  In these cases
noverb:  save for one rather intricate matter
passive: has been referred to me from Marseilles
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  which presents any features of interest
active:  It is possible
noverb:  , however,
active:  I may have something
active:  better
active:  very many minutes are over
active:  for this is one of my clients
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  He had risen from his chair
active:  was standing
active:  between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street
noverb:  Looking over his shoulder
active:  I saw
noverb:  on the pavement opposite
active:  there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa
active:  round her neck
noverb:  a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat
passive: was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear
noverb:  From under this great panoply
active:  she peeped up in a nervous
noverb:  hesitating fashion at our windows
active:  her body oscillated backward and forward
novoice: her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  with a plunge
noverb:  as of the swimmer
active:  leaves the bank
active:  she hurried across the road
active:  we heard the sharp clang of the bell
active:  I have seen those symptoms before
active:  said Holmes
active:  throwing his cigarette into the fire
active:  Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
active:  She would like advice
active:  is not sure
active:  the matter is not too delicate for communication
noverb:  And
noverb:  even here we may discriminate
passive: When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man
active:  she no longer oscillates
active:  the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
noverb:  Here we may take it
active:  there is a love matter
active:  the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
novoice: grieved
noverb:  here she comes in person
active:  to resolve our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was a tap
noverb:  at the door
passive: the boy in buttons entered
active:  to announce Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  the lady
active:  herself loomed behind his small black figure
noverb:  a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat
active:  Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
active:  he was remarkable
noverb:  ,
active:  having closed the door
novoice: bowed her into an armchair
active:  he looked her over in the minute
noverb:  abstracted fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  Do you not find
active:  he said
noverb:  with your short sight
active:  it is a little
active:  trying
active:  to do so much typewriting
active:  I did at first
active:  she answered
active:  now I know
active:  the letters are without looking
active:  suddenly realising the full purport of his words
active:  she gave a violent start
active:  looked up
noverb:  with fear and astonishment upon her broad
noverb:  good-humoured face
noverb:  You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes
active:  she cried
noverb:  else
active:  could you know all that
noverb:  Never mind
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  it is my business
active:  to know things
active:  Perhaps I have trained myself
active:  to see
active:  others overlook
noverb:  not
active:  should you come to consult me
active:  I came to
noverb:  you
noverb:  sir
active:  I heard of
noverb:  you from Mrs. Etherege
active:  husband you found
noverb:  easy
noverb:  the police
active:  everyone had given him up for dead
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I wish
active:  you would do as much for me
noverb:  I'm not rich
active:  still I have a hundred a year in my own right
noverb:  besides the little
active:  I make by the machine
active:  I would give it all
active:  to know
active:  has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  his eyes to the ceiling
active:  Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  Yes
active:  I did bang out of the house
active:  she said
active:  for it made me angry
active:  to see the easy way in
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  that is
noverb:  my father
active:  took it all
active:  He would not go to the police
active:  he would not go to
noverb:  you
noverb:  at last
noverb:  as he would do nothing
active:  kept
active:  saying
active:  there was no harm
passive: done
novoice: it made me mad
noverb:  I just on with my things
active:  came right away to you
noverb:  Your father
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  your stepfather, surely,
active:  the name is different
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  my stepfather
noverb:  I call him father
active:  it sounds funny, too, for
active:  he is only five years
noverb:  two months older
noverb:  than myself
active:  And your mother is alive
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  mother is alive and well
noverb:  I wasn't best pleased
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  she married again
noverb:  soon after father's death
noverb:  a man
noverb:  who was nearly fifteen years younger
noverb:  than herself
active:  Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road
active:  he left a tidy business behind him
novoice: mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman
active:  Mr. Windibank came
noverb:  he made her sell the business
noverb:  for
active:  he was very superior
noverb:  , being a traveller in wines
active:  They got $4700 for the goodwill
noverb:  interest
noverb:  wasn't near
active:  father could have got
active:  he had been alive
active:  I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient
noverb:  under this rambling
noverb:  inconsequential narrative
active:  , on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
noverb:  Your own little income
active:  he asked
active:  does it come out of the business
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  It is quite separate
noverb:  and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland
active:  It is in New Zealand stock
noverb:  paying 4 1/4 per cent
active:  Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount
active:  I can only touch the interest
active:  You interest me extremely
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And
noverb:  you draw
noverb:  large a sum as a hundred a year
noverb:  with
active:  you earn into the bargain
noverb:  you no doubt travel a little
active:  indulge yourself in every way
active:  I believe
active:  a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60
active:  I could do with much less than
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you understand
active:  I live at home I don't wish
active:  to be a burden to them
active:  they have the use of the money just
active:  I am staying with them
noverb:  Of course
active:  that is only just for the time
active:  Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
noverb:  pays it over
active:  to mother
active:  I find
active:  I can do pretty well with
active:  I earn at typewriting
noverb:  It brings me twopence a sheet
active:  I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
active:  You have made your position very clear
noverb:  to me
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  Dr. Watson
active:  you can speak
noverb:  myself
noverb:  Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face
active:  she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
noverb:  I met him first at the gasfitters' ball
active:  she said
active:  They used to send father tickets
active:  he was alive
noverb:  ,
active:  afterwards they remembered us
active:  sent them
active:  to mother
active:  Mr. Windibank did not wish us
active:  to go
active:  He never did wish us
active:  to go anywhere
active:  He would get quite mad
active:  I wanted
active:  to join a Sunday-school treat
noverb:  this time
passive: I was set on going
active:  I would go
noverb:  for
active:  right had he
active:  to prevent
active:  He said
passive: the folk were not fit for us
active:  to know
noverb:  all father's friends were to be there
active:  And he said
active:  I had nothing
active:  fit
active:  to wear
active:  I had my purple plush
active:  I had never
noverb:  taken out of the drawer
noverb:  At last
active:  nothing else would do
active:  he went off to France upon the business of the firm
active:  we went
noverb:  mother
noverb:  I, with Mr. Hardy,
active:  used to be our foreman
active:  it was there
active:  I met Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I suppose
active:  said Holmes
active:  Mr. Windibank came back from France
active:  he was very annoyed
noverb:  at your having gone to the ball
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  well
active:  he was very good
noverb:  about it
active:  He laughed
active:  I remember
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  said
active:  there was no use
active:  denying anything to a woman
noverb:  for she would have her way
active:  I see
active:  at the gasfitters' ball
active:  you met
active:  I understand
active:  a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I met him
noverb:  night
active:  he called next day to ask
active:  we had got home all safe
noverb:  after
active:  we met him
active:  that is to say
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I met him twice for walks
active:  that father came back again
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any
noverb:  No
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know father didn't
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  He wouldn't have any visitors
active:  he could help it
active:  he used to say
active:  a woman should be happy in her own family circle
noverb:  as I used
active:  to say
active:  to mother
active:  a woman wants her own circle
active:  to begin with
active:  I had not got mine
noverb:  about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Did he make no attempt
active:  to see you
noverb:  Well,
active:  father was going off to France again in a week
active:  Hosmer wrote and said
noverb:  that it would be safer and better not
active:  to see each other
active:  he had gone
active:  We could write in the meantime
active:  he used to write every day
active:  I took the letters in in the morning
active:  there was no need
noverb:  for father
active:  to know
active:  Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: We were engaged after the first walk
active:  we took
noverb:  Hosmer
noverb:  Mr. Angel
active:  was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--
noverb:  office
active:  That's the worst of it
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  I don't know
active:  Where did he live
active:  He slept on the premises
noverb:  And you don't know his address
noverb:  No
active:  it was Leadenhall Street
active:  Where did you address your letters
noverb:  To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
passive: to be left till called for
active:  He said
passive: they were sent to the office
passive: he would be chaffed by all the other clerks
active:  having letters from a lady
active:  I offered to typewrite them
noverb:  like he did his
noverb:  he wouldn't have
noverb:  for he said
active:  I wrote them
active:  they seemed
active:  to come from me
active:  they were typewritten
active:  he always felt
active:  the machine had come between us
active:  That will just show you
noverb:  fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things
active:  he would think of
active:  It was most suggestive
active:  said Holmes
active:  It has
active:  long been an axiom of mine
active:  the little things are infinitely the most important
active:  Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes
active:  He would rather walk with me in the evening
noverb:  in the daylight
noverb:  for he said
passive: he hated
active:  to be conspicuous
noverb:  Very retiring
noverb:  gentlemanly he was
active:  Even his voice was gentle
active:  He'd had the quinsy
active:  swollen glands
active:  he was young
noverb:  , he told me
active:  it had left him with a weak throat
noverb:  a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech
active:  He was always well
noverb:  dressed
noverb:  very neat and plain
active:  his eyes were weak
noverb:  just
active:  mine are
active:  he wore tinted glasses against the glare
noverb:  Well,
novoice: happened
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  your stepfather
active:  returned to France
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again
active:  proposed
active:  we should marry
active:  father came back
active:  He was in dreadful earnest
noverb:  made me swear
noverb:  with my hands on the Testament
novoice: happened
active:  I would always be true to him
active:  Mother said
active:  he was quite right
noverb:  to make me swear
active:  it was a sign of his passion
active:  Mother was all in his favour from the first
active:  was even fonder of him
active:  I was
active:  they talked
active:  marrying within the week
active:  I began
active:  to ask about father
noverb:  they
passive: said never
active:  to mind about father
noverb:  just
active:  to tell him afterwards
active:  mother said
active:  she would make it all right with him
noverb:  I didn't quite
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  It seemed funny
active:  I should ask his leave
active:  he was only a few years older
noverb:  than me
noverb:  I didn't want
active:  to do anything on the sly
active:  I wrote
active:  to father at Bordeaux
active:  the company has its French offices
active:  the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
active:  It missed him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  for he had started to England just
active:  it arrived
noverb:  Ha!
active:  was unfortunate
passive: Your wedding was arranged
noverb:  for the Friday
active:  Was it
active:  to be in church
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  very quietly
active:  It was
active:  to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross,
active:  we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel
active:  Hosmer came for us in a hansom
active:  there were two of us
active:  he put us
noverb:  into it
active:  stepped himself into a four-wheeler
active:  happened to be the only other cab in the street
active:  We got to the church first
active:  the four-wheeler drove up
active:  we waited for him
active:  to step out
active:  he never did
active:  the cabman got down from the box
active:  looked
active:  there was no one
noverb:  there
active:  The cabman said
active:  he could not imagine
active:  had become of him
noverb:  for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
active:  That was last Friday
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I have never seen or heard anything
active:  to throw any light upon
active:  became of him
active:  It seems to me
active:  you have been very shamefully treated
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  He was too good and kind
active:  to leave me
noverb:  all the morning
active:  he was saying to me
novoice: happened
active:  I was to be true
noverb:  and
noverb:  even
noverb:  something quite unforeseen occurred
active:  to separate us
active:  I was always to remember
passive: I was pledged to him
active:  he would claim his pledge sooner
noverb:  later
active:  It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning
active:  has happened
active:  gives a meaning to it
active:  Most certainly it does
active:  Your own opinion is
active:  some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I believe
active:  he foresaw some danger
active:  else he would not have talked
active:  And then I think
active:  he foresaw
novoice: happened
active:  you have no notion as to
active:  it could
passive: have been
noverb:  None
noverb:  One
noverb:  question
noverb:  did your mother take the matter
active:  She was angry
noverb:  ,
active:  said
noverb:  that I was never to speak of the matter again
noverb:  And your father
active:  Did you tell him
noverb:  Yes
active:  and he seemed
active:  to think, with me, that something
active:  had happened
active:  I should hear of Hosmer again
noverb:  As he said
noverb:  interest could anyone have
active:  bringing me to the doors of the church
active:  leaving me
noverb:  Now,
active:  he had borrowed my money
active:  he had married me
active:  got my money
novoice: settled on him
active:  there might be some reason
active:  Hosmer was very independent about money
active:  never would look at a shilling of mine
noverb:  And
active:  could have happened
noverb:  And
active:  could he not write
noverb:  Oh
active:  it drives me half-mad
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  I can't sleep a wink at night
active:  She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff
active:  began
active:  to sob heavily into it
active:  I shall glance into the case for you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  rising
active:  and I have no doubt
active:  we shall reach some definite result
active:  Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now
active:  do not let your mind
active:  dwell upon it further
noverb:  Above all
active:  try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory
active:  he has done from your life
noverb:  you don't think I'll see him again
active:  I fear not
active:  has happened to him
active:  You will leave
noverb:  question in my hands
active:  I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his
active:  you can spare
active:  I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle
active:  said she
active:  Here is the slip
active:  here are four letters from him
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And your address
noverb:  No
noverb:  31 Lyon Place
noverb:  Camberwell
noverb:  Mr. Angel's address
active:  you never had
active:  I understand
active:  Where is your father's place of business
active:  He travels for Westhouse & Marbank
noverb:  the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street
active:  Thank you
active:  You have made your statement very clearly
active:  You will leave the papers here
noverb:  ,
active:  remember the advice
active:  I have given you
active:  Let
active:  the whole incident be a sealed book
active:  do not allow it
active:  to affect your life
active:  You are very kind
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  I cannot do that
active:  I shall be true
noverb:  to Hosmer
noverb:  He shall find me ready
active:  he comes back
noverb:  For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face
active:  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor
active:  compelled our respect
active:  She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table
active:  went her way
noverb:  with a promise
active:  to come again
passive: she might be summoned
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
passive: pressed together
novoice: his legs stretched out in front of him
noverb:  his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
active:  he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe
active:  was to him as a counsellor
active:  having lit it
active:  he leaned back in his chair
noverb:  with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him
noverb:  a look of infinite languor in his face
noverb:  Quite an interesting study
noverb:  that maiden
active:  he observed
active:  I found her more interesting
noverb:  her little problem
active:  , by the way, is rather a trite one
active:  You will find parallel cases
active:  you consult my index
noverb:  in Andover in '77
active:  there was something
noverb:  of the sort at The Hague last year
noverb:  Old
active:  is the idea, however,
active:  there were one or two details
active:  were new to me
noverb:  the maiden
active:  herself was most instructive
active:  You appeared to read a good deal upon her
active:  was quite invisible to me
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not invisible
noverb:  unnoticed
noverb:  Watson
active:  You did not know
active:  to look
active:  you missed all
active:  was important
active:  I can never bring you
active:  to realise the importance of sleeves
noverb:  the suggestiveness of thumb-nails
noverb:  the great issues
active:  may hang from a boot-lace
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  did you gather from that woman's appearance
active:  Describe it
noverb:  Well,
active:  she had a slate-coloured
noverb:  broad-brimmed straw hat
noverb:  with a feather of a brickish red
active:  Her jacket was black
noverb:  with black beads sewn upon it
noverb:  a fringe of little black jet ornaments
active:  Her dress was brown
noverb:  rather darker
active:  coffee colour
noverb:  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
active:  Her gloves were greyish
passive: were worn through at the right forefinger
noverb:  Her boots I didn't observe
active:  She had small round
noverb:  hanging gold earrings
noverb:  a general air
novoice: being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way
active:  Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together
novoice: chuckled
noverb:  Pon my word
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are coming along wonderfully
active:  You have really done very well indeed
active:  It is true
noverb:  that you have missed everything of importance
active:  you have hit upon the method
active:  you have a quick eye for colour
active:  Never trust
active:  to general impressions
noverb:  my boy
active:  concentrate yourself upon details
active:  My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve
noverb:  In a man
active:  it is perhaps better first
active:  to take the knee of the trouser
active:  you observe
active:  this woman had plush upon her sleeves
active:  is a most useful material for showing traces
active:  The double line a little above the wrist
noverb:  the typewritist presses against the table
passive: was beautifully defined
active:  The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark
noverb:  only on the left arm
noverb:  on the side of it farthest from the thumb
noverb:  instead
active:  being right across the broadest part
active:  this was
noverb:  I
novoice: glanced at her face
active:  observing the dint of a pince-nez at
noverb:  side of her nose
active:  I ventured a remark upon short sight
noverb:  typewriting
active:  seemed to surprise her
active:  It surprised me
noverb:  , surely,
active:  it was obvious
active:  I was
noverb:  much surprised
novoice: interested
active:  glancing down
active:  to observe
noverb:  the boots
active:  she was wearing
active:  were not unlike each other
active:  they were really odd ones
active:  the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap
noverb:  the other a plain one
passive: One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
noverb:  the other at the first, third
noverb:  fifth
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  a young lady
noverb:  neatly dressed
active:  has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned
active:  it is no great deduction
active:  to say
active:  she came away in a hurry
noverb:  And
noverb:  else
active:  I asked
noverb:  keenly interested
noverb:  as I always was
noverb:  by my friend's incisive reasoning
active:  I noted, in passing,
active:  she had written a note
noverb:  leaving home
passive: being fully dressed
active:  You observed
passive: her right glove was torn at the forefinger
active:  you did not apparently see
noverb:  glove
passive: finger were stained with violet ink
active:  She had written in a hurry
active:  dipped her pen too deep
active:  It must have been this morning
active:  the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
noverb:  All this is amusing
noverb:  rather elementary
active:  I must go back to business
noverb:  Watson
active:  Would you mind
noverb:  reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I held the little
active:  printed slip to the light
noverb:  Missing
active:  it said
noverb:  on the morning of the fourteenth
active:  a gentleman named Hosmer Angel
noverb:  About five ft
noverb:  seven in
noverb:  in height
noverb:  strongly built
noverb:  sallow complexion
noverb:  black hair
active:  a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers
noverb:  moustache
noverb:  tinted glasses
noverb:  slight infirmity of speech
passive: Was dressed
noverb:  last seen
noverb:  in black frock-coat faced with silk
noverb:  black waistcoat
noverb:  gold Albert chain
noverb:  grey Harris tweed trousers
noverb:  with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots
active:  Known
passive: to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street
noverb:  Anybody bringing
active:  That will do
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  As to the letters
active:  he continued
active:  glancing over them
active:  they are very commonplace
noverb:  Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel
noverb:  save
active:  he quotes Balzac once
active:  There is one remarkable point, however,
active:  will no doubt strike you
active:  They are typewritten
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not only
active:  the signature is typewritten
noverb:  Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom
active:  There is a date
noverb:  you see
noverb:  no superscription
noverb:  Leadenhall Street
active:  is rather vague
active:  The point about the signature is very suggestive
noverb:  in fact
active:  we may call it conclusive
noverb:  Of
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  is it possible you do not see
noverb:  strongly it bears upon the case
active:  I cannot say
active:  I do
active:  it were
active:  he wished to be able
active:  to deny his signature
passive: an action for breach of promise were instituted
noverb:  No
active:  that was not the point
noverb:  However,
active:  I shall write two letters
active:  should settle the matter
active:  One is to a firm in the City
active:  the other is
active:  to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him
noverb:  he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening
active:  It is just as well
active:  we should do business with the male relatives
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we can do nothing until the answers to those letters
active:  come
active:  we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
active:  I had had so many reasons
active:  to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning
noverb:  extraordinary energy in action
active:  I felt
active:  he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with
active:  he treated the singular mystery
passive: he had been called upon
active:  to fathom
active:  Once only had I known him
active:  to fail
noverb:  in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph
active:  I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four
novoice: the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet
active:  I felt
active:  it would be a strange tangle indeed
active:  he could not unravel
active:  I left him
active:  still puffing at his black clay pipe
noverb:  with the conviction
active:  I came again on the next evening
active:  I would find
active:  he held in his hands all the clues
active:  would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
active:  A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time
noverb:  the whole of next day
active:  I was busy
noverb:  at the bedside of the sufferer
active:  It was not until close upon six o'clock
active:  I found myself free
active:  was able
active:  to spring into a hansom
noverb:  drive to Baker Street
noverb:  half afraid
active:  I might be too late
active:  to assist at the denouement of the little mystery
active:  I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
noverb:  A formidable array of bottles
noverb:  test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me
active:  he had spent his day in the chemical work
active:  was so dear to him
noverb:  Well,
passive: have
active:  you solved it
active:  I asked
active:  I entered
noverb:  Yes
active:  It was the bisulphate of baryta
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the mystery
active:  I cried
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  that
active:  I thought of the salt
active:  I have been working upon
active:  There was never any mystery
noverb:  in the matter, though, as I said yesterday
active:  some of the details are of interest
active:  The only drawback is
active:  there is no law
active:  I fear
active:  that can touch the scoundrel
active:  was he
active:  was his object
active:  deserting Miss Sutherland
active:  The question was hardly out of my mouth
active:  Holmes had not yet opened his lips
active:  to reply
active:  we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
active:  This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  He has written to me
active:  to say
active:  he would be here
noverb:  at six
active:  Come in
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a sturdy
noverb:  middle-sized fellow
noverb:  some thirty years of age, clean-shaven
noverb:  sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner
noverb:  a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
active:  He shot a questioning glance at each of us
active:  placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard
novoice: with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
noverb:  Good-evening
noverb:  Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  this typewritten letter is from
noverb:  you
noverb:  in
active:  you made an appointment with me for six o'clock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am a little late
active:  I am not quite my own master
active:  you know
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter
noverb:  for I think
novoice: it is far
noverb:  better not
active:  to wash linen of the sort in public
active:  It was quite against my wishes
active:  she came
active:  she is a very excitable, impulsive girl
noverb:  as you may have noticed
passive: she is not easily controlled
active:  she has made up her mind on a point
noverb:  Of course
active:  I did not mind you
noverb:  much
passive: you are not connected with the official police
active:  it is not pleasant
noverb:  to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is a useless expense
noverb:  for
active:  could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  I will succeed
active:  discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Mr. Windibank gave a violent start
active:  dropped his gloves
passive: I am delighted
active:  to hear it
active:  he said
active:  It is a curious thing
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting
active:  they are quite new
noverb:  , no two of them write exactly alike
active:  Some letters get more worn
noverb:  others
noverb:  some wear only on one side
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you remark in this note of yours
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  in every case
active:  there is some little
active:  slurring over of the 'e
noverb:  a slight defect in the tail of the 'r
active:  There are fourteen other characteristics
noverb:  those are the more obvious
active:  We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it is a little worn
active:  our visitor answered
active:  glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
active:  And now I will show you
active:  is really a very interesting study
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Holmes continued
active:  I think
active:  writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation
active:  to crime
active:  It is a subject to
active:  I have devoted some little attention
active:  I have here four letters
active:  purport
active:  to come from the missing man
active:  They are all
active:  typewritten
noverb:  In each case
active:  not only are the 'e's' slurred
noverb:  the 'r's' tailless
active:  you will observe
noverb:  you care
noverb:  to use my magnifying lens
noverb:  the fourteen other characteristics to
active:  I have alluded
active:  are there as well
active:  Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair
active:  picked up his hat
active:  I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes
active:  he said
active:  you can catch the man
active:  catch him
noverb:  let me know
active:  you have done it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  said Holmes
active:  stepping over
active:  turning the key in the door
active:  I let
active:  you know
active:  I have caught him
noverb:  !
noverb:  shouted Mr. Windibank
noverb:  turning white to his lips
active:  glancing about him like a rat in a trap
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  it won't do
noverb:  really it won't
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  There is no possible
active:  getting out of it, Mr. Windibank
active:  It is quite too transparent
active:  it was a very bad compliment
active:  you said
active:  it was impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to solve
noverb:  simple a question
active:  That's right
active:  Sit down
noverb:  let us talk it over
active:  Our visitor collapsed into a chair
noverb:  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
noverb:  It
active:  it's not actionable
active:  he stammered
active:  I am very much
noverb:  afraid
active:  it is not
noverb:  between ourselves
noverb:  Windibank
active:  it was as cruel
noverb:  selfish
noverb:  heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came
noverb:  me
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  let me just run over the course of events
active:  you will contradict me
active:  I go wrong
active:  The man sat huddled up in his chair
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  like one
passive: is utterly crushed
active:  Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece
noverb:  leaning back with his hands in his pockets
active:  began talking
noverb:  rather to himself
novoice: it seemed
noverb:  to us
active:  The man married a woman very much older
noverb:  himself for her money
active:  said he
active:  and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter
active:  she lived with them
active:  It was a considerable sum
noverb:  for people in their position
active:  the loss of it would have made a serious difference
active:  It was worth
noverb:  an effort
active:  to preserve it
active:  The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition
noverb:  affectionate
noverb:  warm-hearted in her ways
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that with her fair personal advantages
noverb:  her little income
passive: she would not be allowed
active:  to remain single long
active:  Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year
active:  does her stepfather
active:  do to prevent it
active:  He takes the obvious course
active:  keeping her at home
active:  forbidding her
active:  to seek the company of people of her own age
active:  soon he found
active:  that would not answer forever
active:  She became restive
novoice: insisted upon her rights
active:  finally announced her positive intention
active:  going to a certain ball
active:  does her clever stepfather
active:  do
active:  He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
noverb:  than to his heart
active:  With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
active:  covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses
active:  masked the face with a moustache
noverb:  a pair of bushy whiskers
noverb:  sunk
noverb:  clear voice into an insinuating whisper
active:  doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight
active:  he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  keeps off other lovers by making love himself
active:  It was only a joke
noverb:  at first
active:  groaned our visitor
active:  We never thought
active:  she would have been
novoice: carried away
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  However that may be
active:  the young lady was very decidedly carried away
active:  having quite made up her mind
active:  her stepfather was in France
noverb:  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind
passive: She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions
passive: the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
active:  Then Mr. Angel began
active:  to call
active:  for it was obvious
noverb:  that the matter should be pushed
active:  it would go
active:  a real effect were to be produced
active:  There were meetings
noverb:  ,
noverb:  an engagement
active:  would finally secure the girl's affections
active:  turning towards anyone else
passive: the deception could not be kept up forever
active:  These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous
noverb:  The thing
active:  to do
active:  was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner
active:  it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind
active:  prevent her
active:  looking upon any other suitor for some time
active:  to come
active:  Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament
noverb:  hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
active:  James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland
active:  to be
novoice: bound to Hosmer Angel
noverb:  so uncertain as to his fate
noverb:  for ten years
active:  to come, at any rate,
active:  she would not listen to another man
noverb:  the church door
active:  he brought her
noverb:  as he could go no farther
noverb:  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
active:  stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler
noverb:  out at the other
active:  I think
active:  was the chain of events
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance
active:  Holmes had been talking
active:  he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
active:  It may be
active:  it may not
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  you are
noverb:  very sharp you ought to be sharp enough
active:  to know
active:  it is you
active:  are breaking the law now
noverb:  not me
active:  I have done nothing actionable from the first
noverb:  ,
noverb:  you keep
active:  door locked
noverb:  you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
active:  The law cannot
active:  you say
active:  touch you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  unlocking and throwing open the door
noverb:  yet
active:  there never was a man
noverb:  who deserved punishment
active:  the young lady has a brother or a friend
active:  he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
noverb:  By Jove
active:  he continued
active:  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face
active:  it is not part of my duties
noverb:  to my client
noverb:  here's a hunting crop handy
noverb:  ,
active:  I think
active:  I shall just treat myself to
active:  He took two swift steps to the whip
active:  he could grasp it
active:  there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
novoice: the heavy hall door banged
noverb:  from the window
active:  we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
active:  There's a cold-blooded scoundrel
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  he threw himself down into his chair once
active:  That fellow will rise from crime to crime
active:  he does something very bad
noverb:  ,
noverb:  ends on a gallows
active:  The case has
active:  , in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest
active:  I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  of course
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct
active:  it was equally clear
noverb:  that the only man
passive: really profited by the incident
active:  we could see
active:  was the stepfather
noverb:  the fact
active:  the two men were never together
novoice: the one always appeared
active:  the other was away
active:  was suggestive
active:  So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
novoice: hinted at a disguise
active:  did the bushy whiskers
active:  My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action
active:  typewriting his signature
active:  , of course, inferred
active:  his handwriting was so familiar to her
active:  she would recognise even the smallest sample of it
active:  You see all these isolated facts
noverb:  together with many minor ones
noverb:  all pointed in the same direction
noverb:  And
active:  did you verify them
active:  Having once spotted my man
active:  it was easy
active:  to get corroboration
active:  I knew the firm for
active:  this man worked
active:  Having taken the printed description
active:  I eliminated everything from it

noverb:  And Miss Sutherland
noverb:  I tell her she will not believe me

noverb:  the change would do you good
active:  you are always
noverb:  interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases

active:  I answered
active:  I am to go
active:  I must pack at once
noverb:  for I have only half an hour
active:  My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
noverb:  making me a prompt and ready traveller
active:  My wants were few and simple
noverb:  in less than the time stated
active:  I was in a cab with my valise
noverb:  rattling away to Paddington Station
active:  Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform
noverb:  his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter
noverb:  taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap
active:  It is really very good
noverb:  of you
active:  to come
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes a considerable difference to me
active:  having someone with me on
active:  I can thoroughly rely
active:  Local aid is always
noverb:  worthless
novoice: else biassed
active:  you will keep the two corner seats
active:  I shall get the tickets
noverb:  We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
active:  Holmes had brought with him
noverb:  Among these he rummaged and read
noverb:  with intervals of note-taking and of meditation
active:  we were past Reading
active:  he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball
active:  tossed them up onto the rack
active:  Have you heard anything of the case
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not a word
active:  I have not seen a paper for some days
active:  The London press has not had very full accounts
active:  I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order
active:  to master the particulars
active:  It seems
noverb:  from
active:  I gather
active:  to be one of those simple cases
active:  are
noverb:  extremely difficult
active:  That sounds a little paradoxical
active:  it is profoundly true
active:  Singularity is almost invariably a clue
noverb:  The more featureless
noverb:  commonplace a crime is
noverb:  the more difficult it is to bring it home
active:  In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man

noverb:  Well,
passive: it is conjectured
active:  to be
active:  I shall take nothing for granted

active:  The game-keeper adds
active:  within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass
active:  he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy,
active:  going the same way with a gun under his arm
noverb:  To the best of his belief
active:  the father was actually in sight at the time
active:  the son was following him
active:  He thought no
noverb:  of the matter
active:  he heard in the evening of the tragedy

active:  have referred the case to the next Assizes
noverb:  Those are the main facts of the case
active:  they came out
noverb:  the coroner and the police-court
active:  I could hardly imagine a more damning case
active:  I remarked
active:  circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal
active:  it does
noverb:  here
active:  Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing
active:  answered Holmes thoughtfully
active:  It may seem to point very straight to one thing
noverb:  you shift your own point of view a little
active:  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
passive: It must be confessed, however,
active:  the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man
active:  it is very possible
noverb:  that he is indeed the culprit
active:  There are several people in the neighbourhood, however,
noverb:  among them Miss Turner
noverb:  the daughter of the neighbouring landowner
active:  believe in his innocence
active:  have retained Lestrade
active:  you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet

noverb:  Lestrade
passive: being rather puzzled
active:  has referred the case to me
active:  hence it is
active:  two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
active:  I am afraid
active:  said I
active:  the facts are so obvious
active:  you will find little credit
passive: to be gained out of this case
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more deceptive
noverb:  an obvious fact
active:  he answered
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Besides
active:  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
active:  may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade
active:  You know me too well
active:  to think
active:  I am boasting
active:  I say
active:  I shall
active:  confirm or destroy his theory by means
active:  he is quite incapable
noverb:  of employing
noverb:  even of understanding
active:  To take the first example
active:  to hand
noverb:  I very clearly perceive
active:  in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side
active:  I question
active:  Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  I know you well
active:  I know the military neatness
noverb:  characterises you
active:  You shave every morning
noverb:  in this season you shave by the sunlight
active:  your shaving is less and less complete
active:  we get farther back on the left side
active:  it becomes positively slovenly
active:  we get round the angle of the jaw
active:  it is surely very clear
noverb:  that that side is less illuminated
noverb:  the other
active:  I could not imagine a man of your habits
active:  looking at himself in an equal light
passive: being satisfied with such a result
active:  I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
noverb:  Therein lies my metier
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that it may be of some service in the investigation
noverb:  lies
noverb:  us
active:  There are one or two minor points
passive: were brought out in the inquest
active:  are worth
active:  considering
active:  are they
active:  It appears
active:  his arrest did not take place at once
noverb:  after the return to Hatherley Farm
active:  On the inspector of constabulary informing him
active:  he was a prisoner
active:  he remarked
passive: he was not surprised
active:  to hear it
active:  it was no more than his deserts
noverb:  This observation of his had the natural effect
active:  removing any traces of doubt
active:  might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
active:  It was a confession
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  No
passive: for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
noverb:  Coming on the top of such a damning series of events
active:  it was at least a most suspicious remark
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes
active:  it is the brightest rift
noverb:  which I can at present see in the clouds
noverb:  However innocent he might be
active:  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not
active:  to see
active:  the circumstances were very black against him
active:  Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest
noverb:  feigned indignation at it
active:  I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious
noverb:  such surprise
active:  anger would not be natural under the circumstances
active:  might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
active:  His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
noverb:  an innocent man
noverb:  else as a man of considerable self-restraint
noverb:  firmness
noverb:  As to his remark about his deserts
active:  it was also not unnatural
noverb:  if you consider
active:  he stood beside the dead body of his father
active:  there is no doubt
noverb:  that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as
active:  to bandy words with him
noverb:  even
noverb:  according to the little girl
active:  evidence is so important
active:  to raise his hand as
active:  to strike him
noverb:  The self-reproach
noverb:  contrition
passive: are displayed
active:  in his remark appear to me
active:  to be the signs of a healthy mind rather
noverb:  of a guilty one
active:  I shook my head
passive: Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence
active:  I remarked
active:  they have
passive: And many men have been wrongfully hanged
active:  is the young man's own account of the matter
active:  It is
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , not very encouraging to his supporters
active:  there are one or two points in it
active:  are suggestive
noverb:  You will find it here
active:  may read it for yourself
active:  He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper
active:  having turned down the sheet
active:  he pointed out the paragraph in
active:  the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of
active:  had occurred
active:  I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage
active:  read
noverb:  it very carefully
active:  It ran in this way
active:  Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was
noverb:  called
active:  gave evidence
active:  follows

passive: I was informed by the maid
active:  he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom
noverb:  Shortly after my return
active:  I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard
noverb:  looking out of my window
noverb:  I saw him get out
active:  walk rapidly out of the yard
active:  I was not aware
noverb:  in
noverb:  direction he was going
noverb:  I
active:  took my gun
active:  strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool
noverb:  with the intention
active:  visiting the rabbit warren
active:  is upon the other side
active:  On my way I saw William Crowder
noverb:  the game-keeper
active:  he had stated in his evidence
passive: he is mistaken
active:  thinking
active:  I was following my father
active:  I had no idea
active:  he was in front of me
active:  When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of
noverb:  Cooee
active:  was a usual signal between my father and myself
noverb:  I
noverb:  hurried forward
active:  found him standing by the pool
active:  He appeared
passive: to be much surprised
active:  seeing me
active:  asked me rather roughly
active:  I was doing there
active:  A conversation ensued
active:  led to high words
noverb:  almost to blows
active:  for my father was a man of a very violent temper
active:  Seeing
active:  his passion was becoming ungovernable
active:  I left him
active:  returned towards Hatherley Farm
active:  I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
active:  I heard a hideous outcry behind me
active:  caused me
active:  to run back again
active:  I found
active:  my father expiring upon the ground
noverb:  with his head terribly injured
active:  I dropped my gun
active:  held him in my arms
noverb:  he almost
noverb:  expired
active:  I knelt beside him for some minutes
active:  made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper
novoice: his house being the nearest
active:  to ask for assistance
active:  I saw no one near my father
active:  I returned
active:  I have no idea
active:  he came by his injuries
active:  He was not a popular man
active:  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners
active:  he had
active:  I know
noverb:  no active enemies
active:  I know nothing further of the matter
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  Did your father make any statement to you
active:  he died
noverb:  Witness
active:  He mumbled a few words
active:  I could only catch some allusion to a rat
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  did you understand by that
noverb:  Witness
active:  It conveyed no meaning to me
active:  I thought
active:  he was delirious
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was the point upon
noverb:  you
active:  your father had this final quarrel
noverb:  Witness
active:  I should prefer not
active:  to answer
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must press it
noverb:  Witness
active:  It is really impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to tell you
active:  I can assure you
active:  it has nothing
active:  to do with the sad tragedy
active:  followed
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  That is for the court
active:  to decide
active:  I need
active:  not point out to you
noverb:  your refusal
active:  to answer
active:  will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings
active:  may arise
noverb:  Witness
active:  I must still refuse
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I understand
noverb:  the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
noverb:  Witness
active:  It was
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was it
active:  he uttered it
active:  he saw you
active:  he even knew
active:  you had returned from Bristol
noverb:  Witness (with considerable confusion)
active:  I do not know
noverb:  A Juryman
active:  Did you see nothing
active:  aroused your suspicions
active:  you returned
active:  hearing the cry
noverb:  found your father fatally injured
noverb:  Witness
noverb:  Nothing definite
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  do you mean
noverb:  Witness
active:  I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open
active:  I could think of nothing
noverb:  of my father
active:  Yet I have a vague impression
active:  I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
active:  It seemed to me
active:  to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort,
noverb:  a plaid perhaps
active:  When I rose from my father
active:  I looked round for it
passive: it was gone
active:  Do you mean
active:  it disappeared
active:  you went for help
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was gone
active:  You cannot say
active:  it was
noverb:  No
active:  I had
active:  a feeling something was there
noverb:  far from the body
noverb:  A dozen yards
noverb:  And
noverb:  far from the edge of the wood
noverb:  About the same
passive: it was removed
active:  it was
active:  you were within a dozen yards of it
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  with my back towards it
noverb:  This concluded the examination of the witness
active:  I see
active:  said I
active:  I glanced down the column
active:  the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy
active:  He calls attention
noverb:  with reason
active:  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him
active:  seeing him
noverb:  also to his refusal
active:  to give details of his conversation with his father
noverb:  his singular account of his father's dying words
active:  They are all
noverb:  , as he remarks
noverb:  very much against the son
active:  Holmes laughed softly to himself
active:  stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
noverb:  you
active:  the coroner have been at some pains
active:  said he
active:  to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
noverb:  Don't you see
noverb:  you alternately give him credit
active:  having too much imagination
noverb:  too little
noverb:  Too little
active:  he could not invent a cause of quarrel
noverb:  would give him the sympathy of the jury
noverb:  too much
active:  he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat
noverb:  the incident of the vanishing cloth
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I shall approach this case from the point of view
active:  this young man says
active:  is true
active:  we shall see whither
active:  hypothesis will lead us
active:  And now here is my pocket Petrarch
noverb:  not another word shall I say of this case
active:  we are on the scene of action
active:  We lunch at Swindon
active:  I see
active:  we shall be there
noverb:  in twenty minutes
active:  It was nearly four
noverb:  o'clock
noverb:  we at last
active:  passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley
noverb:  over the broad gleaming Severn
active:  found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross
noverb:  A lean, ferret-like man
noverb:  furtive
noverb:  sly-looking
active:  was waiting for us upon the platform
noverb:  In spite of the light brown dustcoat
noverb:  leather-leggings
active:  he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  recognising Lestrade
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
active:  With him we drove to the Hereford Arms
passive: a room had already been engaged for us
active:  I have ordered a carriage
active:  said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
active:  I knew your energetic nature
active:  you would not be happy
active:  you had been on the scene of the crime
active:  It was very nice and complimentary of you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
active:  Lestrade looked startled
active:  I do not quite follow
active:  he said
active:  is the glass
noverb:  Twenty-nine
active:  I see
noverb:  No wind
noverb:  not a cloud in the sky
active:  I have a caseful of cigarettes here
active:  need smoking
active:  the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
active:  I do not think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that I shall use the carriage to-night
active:  Lestrade laughed indulgently
active:  You have
noverb:  no doubt
active:  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
active:  he said
active:  The case is
noverb:  a pikestaff
noverb:  the more one goes into it the plainer
active:  it becomes
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
noverb:  one can't refuse a lady
noverb:  such a very positive one
noverb:  too
active:  She has heard of
noverb:  you
active:  would have your opinion
novoice: I repeatedly told her
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  which you could do
active:  I had not already done
active:  bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door
active:  He had hardly spoken
active:  there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women
active:  I have
noverb:  seen in my life
noverb:  Her violet eyes shining
noverb:  her lips parted
noverb:  a pink flush upon her cheeks
active:  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  she cried
active:  glancing from one to the other of us
noverb:  finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion
active:  I am so glad
noverb:  that you have come
active:  I have driven down
active:  to tell you
active:  I know
noverb:  James didn't do it
active:  I know it
active:  I want you
active:  to start
active:  upon your work knowing it
noverb:  too
noverb:  Never let yourself doubt upon
noverb:  point
active:  We have known each other
active:  we were little children
active:  I know his faults as no one else
active:  does
active:  he is too tender-hearted
active:  to hurt a fly
active:  Such a charge is absurd to anyone
active:  really knows him
active:  I hope
active:  we may clear him, Miss Turner
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  You may rely upon my doing all
active:  I can
active:  you have read the evidence
active:  You have formed some conclusion
active:  Do you not see some loophole, some flaw
noverb:  Do you not yourself think
active:  he is innocent
active:  I think
active:  it is very probable
noverb:  There
noverb:  now
active:  she cried
active:  throwing
active:  back her head
noverb:  looking defiantly at Lestrade
active:  You hear
noverb:  He gives me hopes
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that my colleague has been a little quick
active:  forming his conclusions
active:  he said
active:  he is right
noverb:  Oh
active:  I know
active:  he is right
active:  James never did it
noverb:  And about his quarrel with his father
active:  I am sure
noverb:  the reason
active:  he would not speak
active:  about it to the coroner was
passive: I was concerned in
noverb:  it
noverb:  In
noverb:  way
active:  asked Holmes
active:  It is no time for me
active:  to hide anything
noverb:  James
active:  his father had many disagreements about me
active:  Mr. McCarthy was very anxious
active:  there should be a marriage
noverb:  between us
noverb:  James
active:  I have always loved each other as brother and sister
noverb:  of course
active:  he is young
noverb:  and has seen very little of life
noverb:  --and--well
active:  he naturally did not wish to do anything like
active:  there were quarrels
noverb:  this
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , was one of them
noverb:  And your father
active:  asked Holmes
active:  Was he in favour of such a union
noverb:  No
active:  he was averse
noverb:  to it also
noverb:  No one
active:  Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it
active:  A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen
active:  questioning glances at her
active:  Thank you for this information
active:  said he
active:  May I see your father
noverb:  I call to-morrow
noverb:  ?
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  the doctor won't allow it
noverb:  The doctor
noverb:  Yes
active:  have you not heard
active:  Poor father has never been strong for years back
active:  this has broken him down completely
active:  He has taken to his bed
active:  Dr. Willows says
noverb:  that he is a wreck
passive: his nervous system is shattered
active:  Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
noverb:  who had known dad in the old days in Victoria
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  In Victoria
active:  That is important
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  at the mines
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  at the gold-mines
active:  I understand
active:  Mr. Turner made his money
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  certainly
active:  Thank you, Miss Turner
active:  You have been of material assistance to me
active:  You will tell me
active:  you have any news to-morrow
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you will go to the prison
active:  to see James
noverb:  Oh
active:  you do
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  do tell him
active:  I know him
active:  to be innocent
active:  I will
noverb:  Miss Turner
active:  I must go home now
active:  for dad is very ill
active:  he misses me
active:  I leave him
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  God help you in your undertaking
active:  She hurried from the room
active:  she had entered
active:  we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
active:  I am ashamed
noverb:  of you, Holmes
active:  said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
active:  should you raise up hopes
passive: you are bound
active:  to disappoint
active:  I am not over-tender
noverb:  of heart
active:  I call it cruel
active:  I think
active:  I see my way
active:  to clearing James McCarthy
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Have you an order
active:  to see him in prison
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only for you and me
active:  I shall reconsider my resolution
active:  going out
active:  We have
active:  still time to take a train to Hereford
active:  see him to-night?
noverb:  Ample
noverb:  let us do
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
active:  you will find it very slow
active:  I shall only be away a couple of hours
active:  I walked down to the station with them
novoice: wandered through the streets of the little town
active:  finally returning to the hotel
active:  I lay upon the sofa
active:  tried
active:  to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel
active:  The puny plot of the story was so thin
noverb:  however
passive: compared to the deep mystery through
active:  we were groping
active:  I found
active:  my attention wander
noverb:  continually from the action to the fact
noverb:  I at last flung it across the room
active:  gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
noverb:  Supposing
active:  this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true
noverb:  hellish thing
noverb:  absolutely unforeseen
active:  extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time
active:  he parted from his father
noverb:  the moment
noverb:  drawn back by his screams
active:  he rushed into the glade
active:  It was something
noverb:  terrible and deadly
active:  could it be
active:  Might not the nature of the injuries
active:  reveal something to my medical instincts
active:  I rang the bell
active:  called for the weekly county paper
active:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest
passive: In the surgeon's deposition it was stated
noverb:  the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone
passive: had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
active:  I marked the spot upon my own head
passive: Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
active:  That was to some extent in favour of the accused
noverb:  as
noverb:  seen quarrelling
active:  he was face to face
noverb:  with his father
noverb:  Still,
active:  it did not go for very much
active:  for the older man might have turned his back
active:  the blow fell
noverb:  Still,
active:  it might be worth
noverb:  while
active:  to call Holmes' attention to it
active:  there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
active:  could
noverb:  mean
active:  It could not be delirium
noverb:  A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
noverb:  No
active:  it was more
noverb:  likely
active:  to be an attempt
active:  to explain
active:  he met his fate
active:  could it indicate
active:  I cudgelled my brains
active:  to find some possible explanation
active:  And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy
active:  were true the murderer
active:  must have dropped some part of his dress
noverb:  presumably his overcoat, in his flight,
active:  must have had the hardihood
active:  to return
active:  to carry it away at the instant
active:  the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
noverb:  a tissue of mysteries
noverb:  improbabilities the whole thing was
active:  I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion
active:  I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight
active:  I could not lose hope
novoice: every fresh fact seemed
active:  to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence
active:  It was late
active:  Sherlock Holmes returned
active:  He came back alone
active:  for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
noverb:  The glass still keeps very high
active:  he remarked as
active:  he sat down
active:  It is of importance
active:  it should not rain
active:  we are able
active:  to go over the ground
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  a man should be at his very best
noverb:  keenest for such nice work as
active:  I did not wish to do it
novoice: fagged by a long journey
active:  I have seen young McCarthy
noverb:  And
active:  did you learn from him
noverb:  Nothing
active:  Could he throw no light
noverb:  None at all
passive: I was inclined
active:  to think at one time
active:  he knew
active:  had done it
active:  was screening him
noverb:  her
passive: I am convinced now
active:  he is
noverb:  everyone else
active:  He is not a very quick-witted youth
noverb:  comely
active:  to look at
active:  I should think
noverb:  sound at heart
active:  I cannot admire his taste
active:  I remarked
active:  it is indeed a fact
noverb:  that he was averse
noverb:  to a marriage with
active:  charming a young lady as this Miss Turner
noverb:  Ah
active:  thereby hangs a rather painful tale
active:  This fellow is madly
noverb:  insanely
noverb:  in love with her
noverb:  some two years ago
active:  he was only a lad
active:  he really knew her
noverb:  for she had been away five years at a boarding-school
active:  does the idiot
active:  do
active:  get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol
active:  marry her at a registry office
active:  No one knows a word of the matter
active:  you can imagine
active:  maddening
active:  it must be to him
active:  to be upbraided for not doing
active:  he would give his very eyes
active:  to do
active:  he knows to be absolutely impossible
active:  It was sheer frenzy of this sort
noverb:  made him throw his hands up into the air
active:  his father, at their last interview, was goading him on
active:  to propose to Miss Turner
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he had no means
active:  supporting himself
noverb:  his father
active:  was by all accounts a very hard man
active:  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
active:  It was with his barmaid wife
active:  he had spent the last three days in Bristol
active:  his father did not know
active:  he was
noverb:  Mark
active:  point
active:  It is of importance
active:  Good has come out of evil
noverb:  however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
active:  he is in serious trouble
noverb:  likely
passive: to be hanged
active:  has thrown him over utterly
active:  has written to him
active:  to say
active:  she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
active:  there is really no tie
noverb:  between them
active:  I think
active:  bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
active:  he has suffered
active:  he is innocent
noverb:  ,
active:  has done it
noverb:  Ah!
active:  I would call your attention very particularly to two points
active:  One is
active:  the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool
active:  the someone could not have been his son
active:  for his son was away
active:  he did not know
active:  he would return
active:  The second is
passive: the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee
active:  he knew
active:  his son had returned
noverb:  Those are the crucial points upon
active:  the case depends
noverb:  And now let us talk about George Meredith
noverb:  you
active:  we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
active:  There was no rain
active:  Holmes had foretold
noverb:  the morning broke bright
noverb:  cloudless
noverb:  At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage
active:  we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
active:  There is serious news this morning
active:  Lestrade observed
active:  It is said
active:  Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill
passive: his life is despaired of
noverb:  An elderly man
active:  I presume
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  About sixty
passive: his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad
active:  he has been in failing health for some time
active:  This business has had a very bad effect upon him
active:  He was an old friend of McCarthy's
active:  I may add
noverb:  a great benefactor to him
noverb:  for I have learned
noverb:  he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is interesting
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  In a hundred other ways
active:  he has helped him
noverb:  Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
noverb:  Really
active:  Does it not strike you as a little singular
noverb:  this McCarthy
active:  appears to have had little of his own
active:  to have been under such obligations to Turner
active:  should still talk
active:  marrying his son to Turner's daughter
active:  is
noverb:  presumably
noverb:  heiress to the estate
noverb:  in such a very cocksure manner
noverb:  as
active:  it were merely a case of a proposal
noverb:  and all else would follow
active:  It is the
noverb:  more strange
active:  we know that Turner
active:  himself was averse
noverb:  to the idea
active:  The daughter told us as much
active:  Do you not deduce something from that
active:  We have got to the deductions and the inferences
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  winking at me
active:  I find it hard enough
active:  to tackle facts
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  without flying away after theories and fancies
active:  You are right
active:  said Holmes demurely
active:  you do find it very hard
active:  to tackle the facts
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  I have grasped one fact
active:  you seem to find it difficult
active:  to get hold of
active:  replied Lestrade with some warmth
noverb:  And
active:  is
active:  That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior
active:  all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
noverb:  Well,
active:  moonshine is a brighter thing
noverb:  fog
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  But I am very much mistaken
active:  this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is it
active:  It was a widespread
noverb:  comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed
noverb:  with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
noverb:  The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys
noverb:  however
noverb:  gave it a stricken look
noverb:  as
noverb:  the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
active:  We called at the door
noverb:  the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots
active:  her master wore at the time of his death
noverb:  also a pair of the son's
noverb:  not the pair
active:  he had
passive: had
active:  Having measured these very carefully from seven
noverb:  eight different points
novoice: Holmes desired
passive: to be led to the court-yard
noverb:  from
noverb:  we all followed the winding track
active:  led to Boscombe Pool
passive: Sherlock Holmes was transformed
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon such a scent as this
noverb:  Men
active:  had only known the quiet thinker
active:  logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him
noverb:  His face flushed
noverb:  darkened
passive: His brows were drawn into two hard black lines
active:  his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
active:  His face was bent downward
noverb:  his shoulders bowed
noverb:  his lips compressed
novoice: the veins stood out
noverb:  whipcord in his long
noverb:  sinewy neck
active:  His nostrils seemed
active:  to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase
active:  his mind was
novoice: absolutely concentrated upon the matter
noverb:  him
noverb:  a question
noverb:  remark fell unheeded upon his ears
noverb:  at the
active:  only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply
noverb:  Swiftly
active:  silently he made his way along the track
active:  ran through the meadows
noverb:  by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool
active:  It was damp
noverb:  , marshy ground
active:  is all
noverb:  district
active:  there were marks of many feet
noverb:  upon the path
noverb:  amid the short grass
active:  bounded it on
noverb:  side
active:  Sometimes Holmes would hurry on
noverb:  sometimes stop dead
active:  once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  I walked behind him
noverb:  the detective indifferent
noverb:  contemptuous
active:  I watched my friend with the interest
active:  sprang from the conviction
passive: every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
noverb:  The Boscombe Pool
noverb:  is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across
active:  is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner
noverb:  Above the woods
active:  lined it upon the farther side
active:  we could see the red
noverb:  jutting pinnacles
active:  marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling
active:  On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick
noverb:  there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
active:  lined the lake
noverb:  Lestrade showed us the exact spot at
passive: the body had been found
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  so moist was the ground
active:  I could plainly see the traces
passive: had been left by the fall of the stricken man
noverb:  To Holmes
noverb:  as I could see by his eager face
active:  peering eyes
active:  very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass
active:  He ran round
noverb:  like a dog
active:  is picking up a scent
noverb:  turned upon my companion
active:  did you go into the pool for
active:  he asked
active:  I fished about with a rake
active:  I thought
active:  there might be some weapon or other trace
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut
active:  I have no time
active:  That left foot of
novoice: yours with its inward twist is all
noverb:  over the place
active:  A mole could trace it
noverb:  there
active:  it vanishes among the reeds
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  simple it would all have been had
active:  I been here
noverb:  before they came
noverb:  a herd of buffalo
novoice: wallowed all over it
active:  Here is
active:  the party with the lodge-keeper came
active:  they have covered all tracks for six
active:  eight feet round the body
active:  here are three separate tracks of the same feet
active:  He drew out a lens
active:  lay down upon his waterproof
active:  to have a better view
active:  talking all the time rather to himself
noverb:  to us
noverb:  These are young McCarthy's feet
active:  Twice he was walking
active:  once he ran swiftly
passive: the soles are deeply marked
noverb:  the heels hardly visible
active:  That bears out his story
active:  He ran
active:  he saw his father on the ground
active:  here are the father's feet
active:  he paced up and down
active:  is this
active:  It is the butt-end of the gun
active:  the son stood listening
noverb:  And this
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  have we here
noverb:  Tiptoes! tiptoes
noverb:  Square,
noverb:  too
noverb:  quite unusual boots
active:  They come
active:  they go
active:  they come again
noverb:  of course
active:  was for the cloak
active:  Now where did they come from
active:  He ran up and down
noverb:  sometimes losing
active:  sometimes finding the track
active:  we were well within the edge of the wood
noverb:  under the shadow of a great beech
noverb:  the largest tree in the neighbourhood
active:  Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this
active:  lay down once
noverb:  upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
active:  For a long time he remained there
noverb:  turning over the leaves
noverb:  dried sticks
active:  gathering up
novoice: seemed to me to be dust into an envelope
active:  examining with his lens not only the ground
noverb:  even the bark of the tree
active:  he could reach
active:  A jagged stone was lying among the moss
noverb:  this also he carefully examined and retained
active:  he followed a pathway through the wood
active:  he came to the highroad
passive: all traces were lost
active:  It has been a case of considerable interest
active:  he remarked
noverb:  returning to his natural manner
active:  I fancy
active:  this grey house on the right must be the lodge
active:  I think
active:  I will go in
active:  have a word with Moran
active:  perhaps write a little note
active:  Having done
active:  we may drive back to our luncheon
active:  You may walk to the cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you presently
active:  It was about ten minutes
active:  we regained our cab
active:  drove back into Ross
active:  Holmes still carrying with him the stone
active:  he had picked up in the wood
active:  This may interest you, Lestrade
active:  he remarked
active:  holding it out
passive: The murder was done with
noverb:  it
active:  I see no marks
active:  There are none
active:  do you know
active:  The grass was growing under
noverb:  it
active:  It had only lain there a few days
active:  There was no sign of a place whence
passive: it had been taken
active:  It corresponds with the injuries
active:  There is no sign of any other weapon
noverb:  And the murderer
noverb:  Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg
active:  wears thick-soled shooting-boots
noverb:  a grey cloak
noverb:  smokes Indian cigars
noverb:  uses a cigar-holder
noverb:  carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket
active:  There are several other indications
noverb:  these may be enough
active:  to aid us in our search
active:  Lestrade laughed
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am still a sceptic
active:  he said
active:  Theories are all very well
active:  we have
active:  to deal with a hard-headed British jury
noverb:  Nous verrons
active:  answered Holmes calmly
active:  You work your own method
active:  I shall work mine
active:  I shall be busy
noverb:  this afternoon
active:  shall probably return to London by the evening train
noverb:  And leave your case unfinished
noverb:  No
noverb:  finished
noverb:  the mystery
passive: It is solved
active:  was the criminal
noverb:  The gentleman
active:  I describe
active:  is he
active:  Surely it would not be difficult
active:  to find out
active:  This is not such a populous neighbourhood
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am a practical man
active:  he said
active:  and I really cannot undertake
active:  to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg
active:  I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard
noverb:  All right
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  I have given you the chance
active:  Here are your lodgings
noverb:  Good-bye
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
active:  I leave
active:  Having left Lestrade at his rooms
active:  we drove to our hotel
active:  we found lunch upon the table
active:  Holmes was silent
active:  buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face
noverb:  as one
active:  finds himself in a perplexing position
noverb:  Look here
noverb:  Watson
active:  he said
passive: the cloth was cleared
active:  just sit down in this chair
noverb:  let me preach to
noverb:  you for a little
noverb:  I don't know quite
active:  to do
active:  I should value your advice
active:  Light a cigar
noverb:  let me expound
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  now
active:  considering this case
active:  there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative
active:  struck us
active:  they impressed me in his favour and you against him
active:  One was the fact
active:  his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee
active:  seeing him
active:  The other was his singular dying reference to a rat
active:  He mumbled several words
active:  you understand
active:  was all
active:  caught the son's ear
noverb:  Now from this double point
active:  our research must commence
active:  we will begin it
active:  presuming
active:  the lad says
active:  is absolutely true
noverb:  of this 'Cooee
noverb:  Well,
passive: obviously it could not have been meant for the son
noverb:  The son
active:  he knew
active:  was in Bristol
active:  It was mere chance
active:  he was within earshot
noverb:  The 'Cooee
passive: was meant
active:  to attract the attention of whoever it was
active:  he had the appointment with
noverb:  But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry
noverb:  one
passive: is used between Australians
active:  There is a strong presumption
noverb:  that the person
novoice: McCarthy expected
active:  to meet
active:  him at Boscombe Pool was someone
noverb:  who had been in Australia
noverb:  of the rat
active:  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket
active:  flattened it out on the table
active:  This is a map of the Colony of Victoria
active:  he said
active:  I wired to Bristol for it last night
active:  He put his hand over part of the map
noverb:  do you read
noverb:  ARAT
active:  I read
noverb:  And now
active:  He raised his hand
noverb:  BALLARAT
noverb:  Quite
active:  That was the word
novoice: the man uttered
noverb:  of
noverb:  his son only caught the last two syllables
active:  He was trying to utter the name of his murderer
noverb:  of Ballarat
active:  It is wonderful
active:  I exclaimed
active:  It is obvious
noverb:  And now
noverb:  you see
active:  I had narrowed the field down considerably
active:  The possession of a grey garment was a third point
active:  granting the son's statement
active:  to be correct
active:  was a certainty
active:  We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  And one
active:  was at home in the district
passive: for the pool can only be approached by the farm
noverb:  by the estate
active:  strangers could hardly wander
noverb:  Quite
active:  comes our expedition of to-day
active:  By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details
active:  I gave to that imbecile Lestrade
noverb:  as to the personality of the criminal
active:  did you gain them
active:  You know my method
passive: It is founded upon the observation of trifles
noverb:  His height
active:  I know
active:  you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
noverb:  His boots
noverb:  too
active:  might be told from their traces
noverb:  Yes
active:  they were peculiar boots
noverb:  his lameness
active:  The impression of his right foot was always less distinct
noverb:  his left
active:  He put
noverb:  weight upon it
active:  he limped
active:  he was lame
noverb:  his left-handedness
noverb:  You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury
passive: recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
passive: The blow was struck from immediately behind
active:  was upon the left side
noverb:  Now,
active:  can
active:  be
active:  it were by a left-handed man
active:  He had stood behind
noverb:  tree during the interview between the father and son
active:  He had even smoked there
active:  I found the ash of a cigar
active:  my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me
active:  to pronounce as an Indian cigar
active:  I have
active:  you know
active:  devoted some attention to this
active:  written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco
active:  Having found the ash
noverb:  I
active:  looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
active:  he had tossed it
active:  It was an Indian cigar
noverb:  of the variety
passive: are rolled in Rotterdam
noverb:  And the cigar-holder?
active:  I could see
active:  the end had not been in his mouth
active:  Therefore he used a holder
passive: The tip had been cut off
active:  not bitten off
noverb:  the cut was not a clean one
active:  I deduced a blunt pen-knife
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I said
noverb:  you have drawn a net round this man from
active:  he cannot escape
active:  you have saved an innocent human life
active:  you had cut the cord
active:  was hanging him
active:  I see the direction in
noverb:  all this points
active:  The culprit is
noverb:  Mr. John Turner
active:  cried the hotel waiter
active:  opening the door of our sitting-room
active:  ushering in a visitor
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a strange and impressive figure
noverb:  His slow
noverb:  limping step
active:  bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude

active:  it were new raised from a basin
noverb:  Well,
active:  to come to an end of the matter
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  not
active:  to abuse your patience
active:  there came a night
active:  he made one of those drunken sallies from
active:  he never came back
active:  We found him
active:  we went
active:  to search for him
noverb:  face downward in a little green-scummed pool
noverb:  lay at the foot of the garden
active:  There was no sign of any violence
active:  the water was
noverb:  two feet deep
noverb:  the jury
active:  having regard to his known eccentricity
active:  brought in a verdict of 'suicide
noverb:  But I
active:  knew
active:  he winced from the very thought of death
active:  had much ado
active:  to persuade myself
active:  he had gone out of his way
active:  to meet it
active:  The matter passed
noverb:  however
novoice: my father entered into possession of the estate
noverb:  of some $14,000,
active:  lay to his credit at the bank
noverb:  One moment
active:  Holmes interposed
active:  your statement is
active:  I foresee
noverb:  one of the most remarkable to
active:  I have ever listened
noverb:  Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter
noverb:  the date of his supposed suicide
novoice: The letter arrived on March 10
noverb:  1883
active:  His death was seven weeks later
noverb:  upon the night of May 2nd
active:  Thank you
active:  Pray
active:  proceed
active:  When my father took over the Horsham property
novoice: he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic
passive: had been always locked up
noverb:  We found the brass box there
passive: its contents had been destroyed
noverb:  On the inside of the cover was a paper label
novoice: with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  and 'Letters
active:  memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath
noverb:  These
active:  we presume
active:  indicated the nature of the papers
passive: had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw
noverb:  For the rest
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers
noverb:  note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America
active:  Some of them were of the war time
active:  showed
active:  he had done his duty well
active:  had borne the repute of a brave soldier
active:  Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states
passive: were mostly concerned with politics
noverb:  for he had evidently taken a strong part
active:  opposing the carpet-bag politicians
passive: had been sent down from the North
noverb:  Well,
active:  it was the beginning of '84
active:  my father came
active:  to live at Horsham
noverb:  all went
noverb:  possible with us until the January of '85
noverb:  On the fourth day after the new year
noverb:  I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table
noverb:  There
active:  he was
noverb:  sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand
noverb:  five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one
active:  He had always laughed at
active:  he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel
active:  he looked very scared and puzzled now
active:  the same thing had come upon himself
active:  on earth does this mean, John
active:  he stammered
active:  My heart had turned
active:  to lead
active:  It is K. K. K.
noverb:  ,' said I.
active:  He looked inside the envelope
active:  it is
active:  he cried
active:  Here are the very letters
active:  is this written above them
active:  Put the papers on the sundial
active:  I read
active:  peeping over his shoulder
noverb:  papers
noverb:  sundial
active:  he asked
noverb:  The sundial in the garden
active:  There is no other
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  I
active:  the papers must be those
passive: are destroyed
noverb:  Pooh
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  gripping hard at his courage
active:  We are in a civilised land here
noverb:  we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
active:  Where does the thing come from
noverb:  From Dundee
active:  I answered
active:  glancing at the postmark
noverb:  Some preposterous practical joke
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  have I
active:  to do with sundials and papers
active:  I shall take no notice of such nonsense
active:  I should certainly speak to the police
active:  I said
passive: And be laughed at for my pains
noverb:  Nothing of the sort
noverb:  let me do
noverb:  No
active:  I forbid you
noverb:  I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense
active:  It was in vain
active:  to argue with him
noverb:  for
active:  he was a very obstinate man
active:  I went about
noverb:  however
noverb:  with a heart
active:  was full of forebodings
active:  On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his
noverb:  Major Freebody
active:  is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill
active:  I was glad
noverb:  that he should go
novoice: for it seemed to me
active:  he was farther
noverb:  from danger
active:  he was away from home
noverb:  In
noverb:  however
active:  I was in error
active:  Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major
active:  imploring me
active:  to come at once
active:  My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits
active:  abound in the neighbourhood
active:  was lying senseless
noverb:  with a shattered skull
active:  I hurried to him
active:  he passed away
novoice: having
active:  recovered his consciousness
active:  He had
active:  it appears
active:  been returning from Fareham in the twilight
active:  the country was unknown to him
noverb:  the chalk-pit unfenced
active:  the jury had no hesitation
active:  bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes
noverb:  Carefully
active:  I examined every fact
novoice: connected with his death
active:  I was unable
active:  to find anything
active:  could suggest the idea of murder
active:  There were no signs of violence
noverb:  , no footmarks
noverb:  no robbery
passive: no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
noverb:  And
active:  I need
active:  not tell you
active:  my mind was far from at ease
active:  I was well-nigh
noverb:  certain
passive: some foul plot had been woven
active:  round him
active:  In this sinister way I came into my inheritance
active:  You will ask me
active:  I did not dispose of
noverb:  it
active:  I answer
active:  I was well convinced
active:  our troubles
active:  were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life
active:  the danger would be
active:  pressing in one house as in another
active:  It was in January, '85
novoice: my poor father met his end
noverb:  two years
active:  eight months have elapsed
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  I have lived happily at Horsham
active:  I had begun to hope
active:  this curse had passed away from the family
active:  it had ended with the last generation
active:  I had begun
active:  to take comfort too soon
noverb:  however
noverb:  yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
active:  it had come upon my father
active:  The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope
noverb:  turning to the table
active:  he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
active:  This is the envelope
active:  he continued
active:  The postmark is London
noverb:  eastern division
active:  are the very words
active:  were upon my father's last message
noverb:  'K. K. K.';
noverb:  then 'Put the papers on the sundial
active:  have you done
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Nothing
active:  To tell the truth
active:  he sank his face into his thin
noverb:  white hands
active:  I have felt helpless
active:  I have
active:  felt like one of those poor rabbits
active:  the snake is writhing towards
noverb:  it
active:  I seem
active:  to be in the grasp of some resistless
noverb:  inexorable evil
noverb:  no foresight
active:  no precautions can guard against
noverb:  Tut! tut
active:  cried Sherlock Holmes
active:  You must act
noverb:  man
passive: you are lost
noverb:  Nothing
active:  energy can save you
active:  This is no time for despair
active:  I have seen the police
noverb:  Ah
active:  they listened to my story with a smile
active:  I am convinced
active:  the inspector has formed the opinion
active:  the letters are all practical jokes
active:  the deaths of my relations were really accidents
novoice: as the jury stated
active:  were not
passive: to be connected with the warnings
active:  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
noverb:  Incredible imbecility
active:  he cried
active:  They have
noverb:  however
noverb:  allowed me a policeman
active:  may remain in the house with me
passive: Has
active:  he come with
noverb:  you to-night?
noverb:  No
active:  His orders were
active:  to stay in the house
active:  Again Holmes raved in the air
active:  did you come to me
active:  he cried
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  did you not come at once
active:  I did not know
active:  It was only to-day
noverb:  that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles
passive: was advised by him
active:  to come to
noverb:  you
active:  It is really two days
active:  you had the letter
active:  We should have acted
noverb:  this
active:  You have no further evidence
active:  I suppose
active:  you have placed
noverb:  us
noverb:  no suggestive detail
active:  might help us
active:  There is one thing
active:  said John Openshaw
active:  He rummaged in his coat pocket
active:  drawing out a piece
novoice: discoloured
noverb:  blue-tinted paper
active:  he laid it out upon the table
active:  I have some remembrance
active:  said he
noverb:  on the day
active:  my uncle burned the papers
active:  I observed
noverb:  the small, unburned margins
active:  lay
active:  amid the ashes were of this particular colour
active:  I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room
passive: I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  it may be one of the papers
active:  has
noverb:  perhaps
novoice: fluttered out from among the others
active:  in that way has escaped destruction
noverb:  Beyond the mention of pips
active:  I do not see
noverb:  it helps us much
active:  I think myself
active:  it is a page
noverb:  from some private diary
active:  The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's
active:  Holmes moved the lamp
noverb:  we
noverb:  bent over the sheet of paper
active:  showed by its ragged edge
passive: it had indeed been torn from a book
passive: It was headed
noverb:  March
noverb:  1869
noverb:  and
active:  were the following enigmatical notices
noverb:  4th
active:  Hudson came
noverb:  Same old platform
noverb:  7th
active:  Set the pips on McCauley
noverb:  Paramore
noverb:  John Swain
noverb:  of St. Augustine
noverb:  9th
active:  McCauley cleared
noverb:  10th
active:  John Swain cleared
noverb:  12th
noverb:  Visited Paramore
noverb:  All well
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  folding up the paper
active:  returning it to our visitor
active:  And now you must on no account lose another instant
active:  We cannot spare time even to discuss
active:  you have told me
active:  You must get home
noverb:  act
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  There is
noverb:  one thing
active:  to do
passive: It must be done at once
active:  You must put this piece of paper
active:  you have shown us into the brass box
active:  you have described
active:  You must also put in a note
active:  to say
passive: all the other papers were burned by your uncle
noverb:  this is the only one
noverb:  remains
active:  You must assert
noverb:  in such words
active:  will carry conviction with them
active:  Having done this
active:  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial
passive: directed
active:  Do you understand
noverb:  Entirely
active:  Do not think of revenge
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  at present
active:  I think
active:  we may gain
noverb:  by means of the law
active:  we have our web
active:  to weave
passive: theirs is already woven
active:  The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger
active:  threatens you
active:  The second is
active:  to clear up the mystery
active:  to punish the guilty parties
active:  I thank you
active:  said the young man
noverb:  rising
noverb:  pulling on his overcoat
active:  You have given me fresh life and hope
active:  I shall certainly do
active:  you advise
active:  Do not lose an instant
noverb:  And,
noverb:  above all
noverb:  take care of yourself in the meanwhile
noverb:  for I do not think
active:  there can be a doubt
noverb:  that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
active:  do you go back
noverb:  By train from Waterloo
active:  It is not
noverb:  nine
passive: The streets will be crowded
active:  I trust
active:  you may be in safety
noverb:  And
active:  you cannot guard yourself too closely
passive: I am armed
active:  That is well
active:  To-morrow I shall set
active:  to work upon your case
active:  I shall see you at Horsham
noverb:  No
noverb:  your secret lies in London
active:  It is there
noverb:  that I shall seek it
active:  I shall call upon
noverb:  you in a day
noverb:  in two days
noverb:  with news as to the box and the papers
active:  I shall take your advice in every particular
active:  He shook hands with us
active:  took his leave
novoice: Outside the wind still screamed
active:  the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
active:  This strange, wild story seemed
active:  to have come to us from amid the mad elements
noverb:  blown in upon us
noverb:  a sheet of sea-weed in a gale
noverb:  now
passive: to have
passive: been reabsorbed by them once
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence
noverb:  with his head sunk forward
active:  his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
active:  he lit his pipe
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  he watched the blue smoke-rings
noverb:  as they chased each other up to the ceiling
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  he remarked at last
noverb:  of all our cases
active:  we have had none more fantastic
noverb:  than this
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  the Sign of Four
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  that
noverb:  And
active:  this John Openshaw seems to me
active:  to be walking amid even greater perils
active:  did the Sholtos
active:  have you
active:  I asked
active:  formed any definite conception as to
active:  these perils are
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  as to their nature
active:  he answered
active:  are they
active:  is this K. K. K.
active:  does he pursue this unhappy family
active:  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes
active:  placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  The ideal reasoner
active:  he remarked
active:  would
active:  he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings
active:  deduce from it not only all the chain of events
novoice: led up to it
noverb:  also all the results
active:  would follow from
noverb:  it
active:  As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone
noverb:  the observer
active:  has thoroughly understood
active:  one link in a series of incidents should be able
active:  to accurately state all the other ones
noverb:  after
active:  We have not yet grasped the results
active:  the reason alone can attain to
passive: Problems may be solved in the study
active:  have baffled all those
active:  have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
active:  To carry the art
noverb:  however, to its highest pitch,
active:  it is necessary
noverb:  that the reasoner should be able
active:  to utilise all the facts
active:  have come to his knowledge
active:  and this in itself implies
noverb:  as you will readily see
noverb:  a possession of all knowledge
noverb:  even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias
active:  is a somewhat rare accomplishment
active:  It is not
noverb:  impossible
noverb:  however
active:  a man should possess all knowledge
active:  is likely
active:  to be useful to him in his work
noverb:  this
active:  I have endeavoured in my case
active:  to do
active:  If I remember rightly
active:  you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion
noverb:  Yes
active:  I answered
noverb:  laughing
active:  It was a singular document
noverb:  Philosophy
noverb:  astronomy
passive: politics were marked at zero
active:  I remember
noverb:  Botany variable
noverb:  geology profound as regards
noverb:  the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town
noverb:  chemistry eccentric
noverb:  anatomy unsystematic
noverb:  , sensational literature
noverb:  crime records unique, violin-player, boxer
noverb:  swordsman
noverb:  lawyer
noverb:  self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
noverb:  Those
active:  I think
active:  were the main points of my analysis
active:  Holmes grinned at the last item
noverb:  Well
active:  he said
active:  I say now
noverb:  as I said
active:  a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture
active:  he is likely
active:  to use
noverb:  the rest
active:  he can put away in the lumber-room of his library
active:  he can get it
active:  he wants it
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  for such a case as the one
passive: has been submitted to us to-night
active:  we need certainly to muster all our resources
noverb:  Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia
noverb:  stands upon the shelf beside you
active:  Thank you
noverb:  Now let us consider the situation
noverb:  see
passive: may be deduced from
noverb:  it
noverb:  In the first place
active:  we may start with a strong presumption
active:  Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America
active:  Men at his time of life do not change all their habits
noverb:  exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town
active:  His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea
active:  he was in fear of someone
noverb:  something
active:  we may assume as a working hypothesis
active:  it was fear of someone or something
noverb:  which drove him from America
noverb:  As to
noverb:  it was he feared
active:  we can only deduce
active:  considering the formidable letters
passive: were received by himself and his successors
active:  Did you remark the postmarks of those letters
active:  The first was from Pondicherry
noverb:  the second from Dundee
noverb:  the third from London
noverb:  From East London
active:  do you deduce from that
active:  They are all seaports
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We have already a clue
active:  There can be no doubt
noverb:  that the probability--the strong probability--is
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  And now let us consider another point
noverb:  In the case of Pondicherry
active:  seven weeks elapsed between the threat
noverb:  its fulfilment
noverb:  in Dundee
active:  it was only some three
noverb:  four days
active:  Does
active:  suggest anything
noverb:  A greater distance
active:  to travel
active:  the letter had also a greater distance
active:  to come
active:  I do not see the point
active:  There is at least a presumption
noverb:  that the vessel in
noverb:  the man
active:  men are
active:  is a sailing-ship
active:  It looks as
active:  they always send their singular warning
noverb:  token
noverb:  them
noverb:  starting upon their mission
active:  You see
active:  quickly the deed followed the sign
active:  it came from Dundee
active:  they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer
active:  they would have arrived almost
noverb:  their letter
active:  , as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed
active:  I think
active:  those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat
active:  brought the letter
noverb:  the sailing vessel
active:  brought the writer
active:  It is possible
noverb:  More than that
active:  It is probable
active:  And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case
active:  I urged young Openshaw
active:  to caution
active:  The blow has always fallen at the end of the time
active:  it would take the senders
active:  to travel the distance
active:  this one comes from London
active:  therefore we cannot count upon delay
noverb:  Good God
active:  I cried
active:  can it mean
noverb:  this relentless persecution
noverb:  The papers
active:  Openshaw carried
active:  are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship
active:  I think
active:  it is quite clear
noverb:  that there must be more than one of them
active:  A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as
active:  to deceive a coroner's jury
active:  There must have been several in it
active:  they must have been men of resource and determination
noverb:  Their papers they mean to have
active:  be the holder of them
active:  it may
active:  In this way you see K. K. K.
active:  ceases to be the initials of an individual
active:  becomes the badge of a society
noverb:  of
noverb:  society
active:  Have you never
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  bending forward
active:  sinking his voice
active:  have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan
active:  I never have
active:  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
noverb:  Here it is
active:  said he presently
noverb:  Ku Klux Klan
passive: A name derived
novoice: from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced
active:  cocking a rifle
active:  This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War
noverb:  it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country
noverb:  notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida
passive: Its power was used for political purposes
noverb:  principally for the terrorising of the negro voters
noverb:  the murdering and driving from the country of those
passive: were opposed to its views
passive: Its outrages were usually preceded
novoice: by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
noverb:  generally recognised shape
noverb:  a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts
noverb:  melon seeds
noverb:  orange pips in others
active:  receiving this the victim
active:  might
active:  openly abjure his former ways
active:  might fly from the country
active:  he braved the matter out
active:  death would unfailingly come upon him
noverb:  usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
active:  perfect was the organisation of the society
noverb:  so systematic its methods
active:  there is hardly a case
noverb:  upon record
novoice: any man succeeded in braving it with impunity
noverb:  in
passive: any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
active:  For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government
noverb:  of the better classes of the community in the South
noverb:  Eventually,
noverb:  in the year 1869
noverb:  the movement rather suddenly collapsed
active:  there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort
noverb:  date
active:  You will observe
active:  said Holmes
active:  laying down the volume
noverb:  the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers
active:  It may well
active:  have been cause and effect
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that he
active:  his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
active:  You can understand
noverb:  this register
active:  diary may implicate some of the first men in the South
active:  there may be many
noverb:  who will not sleep easy at night
passive: it is recovered
noverb:  the page
active:  we have seen
active:  Is such as
active:  we might expect
active:  It ran
active:  I remember right
active:  sent the pips to A
noverb:  B
noverb:  C
active:  that is
active:  sent the society's warning to them
active:  there are successive entries
noverb:  A
novoice: B cleared
active:  left the country
noverb:  finally
passive: C was visited
noverb:  with
active:  I fear
noverb:  a sinister result for C. Well
active:  I think
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we may let some light into this dark place
active:  I believe
active:  the only chance young Openshaw has
active:  in the meantime is to do
active:  I have told him
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more
passive: to be said
active:  to be done to-night
active:  hand me over my violin
noverb:  let us try
active:  to forget for half an hour the miserable weather
noverb:  the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
active:  It had cleared in the morning
active:  the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil
noverb:  hangs over the great city
active:  Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast
active:  I came down
active:  You will excuse me for not waiting for
noverb:  you
active:  said he
active:  I have
active:  I foresee
noverb:  a very busy day
noverb:  me
active:  looking into this case of young Openshaw's
noverb:  steps will you take
active:  I asked
active:  It will very much
active:  depend upon the results of my first inquiries
active:  I may have
active:  to go down to Horsham
noverb:  after all
noverb:  You will not go there first
noverb:  No
active:  I shall commence with the City
active:  Just ring the bell
active:  the maid will bring up your coffee
active:  I waited
active:  I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table
active:  glanced my eye over it
active:  It rested upon a heading
active:  sent a chill to my heart
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  you are too late
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  laying down his cup
active:  I feared as much
passive: was it done
active:  He spoke calmly
active:  I could see
passive: he was deeply moved
active:  My eye caught the name of Openshaw
noverb:  the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge
active:  Here is the account
noverb:  Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge
active:  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
noverb:  The night
noverb:  however
active:  was extremely dark and stormy
noverb:  in spite of the help of several passers-by
active:  it was quite impossible
active:  to effect a rescue

noverb:  however
active:  was given
noverb:  by the aid of the water-police

noverb:  in his haste
noverb:  the extreme darkness
active:  he missed his path
active:  walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats

active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident

active:  calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages
active:  We sat in silence for some minutes
noverb:  Holmes more depressed and shaken
noverb:  than I had ever seen him

noverb:  no doubt

noverb:  God sends me health
active:  I shall set my hand upon this gang
active:  he should come to me for help
active:  I should send him away to his death
noverb:  !
active:  He sprang from his chair
active:  paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
active:  They must be cunning devils
active:  he exclaimed at last
active:  could
active:  they have decoyed him down there
active:  The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station
noverb:  The bridge, no doubt
active:  was too crowded
noverb:  even on such a night
noverb:  for their purpose
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall see
active:  will win in the long run
active:  I am going out now
noverb:  To the police
noverb:  No

noverb:  not before
noverb:  All day

active:  I have had nothing
noverb:  breakfast
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Not a bite
active:  I had no time
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  And
active:  have you succeeded
noverb:  Well
active:  You have a clue
active:  I have them in the hollow of my hand
active:  Young Openshaw shall not long
active:  remain unavenged
noverb:  Watson
novoice: let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them
active:  It is well thought of
noverb:  do you mean
active:  He took an orange from the cupboard
active:  tearing it to pieces
active:  he squeezed out the pips upon the table
noverb:  Of these he took five
novoice: thrust them into an envelope
noverb:  On the inside of the flap
active:  he wrote
noverb:  S. H. for J. O.
active:  he sealed it
active:  addressed it to
noverb:  Captain James Calhoun
noverb:  Barque Lone Star
noverb:  Savannah, Georgia
active:  That will await him
active:  he enters port
active:  said he
active:  chuckling
noverb:  It may give him a sleepless night
active:  He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate
active:  Openshaw did
noverb:  him
noverb:  And
noverb:  who is this Captain Calhoun
noverb:  The leader of the gang
active:  I shall have the others
noverb:  he first
active:  did you trace it
active:  He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket
noverb:  all covered with dates and names
active:  I have spent the whole day
active:  said he
noverb:  over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers
active:  following the future career of every vessel
active:  touched at Pondicherry in January
noverb:  February in '83

active:  having cleared from London
active:  the name is

noverb:  Texas
active:  I think
active:  I was not

active:  I knew
active:  the ship must have an American origin

active:  There is
noverb:  a flaw
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the best laid of human plans

active:  would show them
noverb:  another
noverb:  as cunning
noverb:  themselves

noverb:  sensations
active:  he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
active:  to produce the same effects

noverb:  for many years

noverb:  the wreck and ruin of a noble man
noverb:  One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell
noverb:  about the hour
active:  a man gives his first yawn
noverb:  glances at the clock
active:  I sat up in my chair
active:  my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap
active:  made a little face of disappointment
noverb:  A patient
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  You'll have
active:  to go out
active:  I groaned
noverb:  for

noverb:  Oh
noverb:  I'm in such trouble
active:  she cried
active:  I do
noverb:  want a little help
active:  said my wife
novoice: pulling up her veil
active:  it is Kate Whitney
active:  you startled me, Kate
active:  I had not an idea
active:  you were

noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  I came straight to you
active:  That was always the way
noverb:  Folk

noverb:  of you
active:  to come

noverb:  water
active:  sit here comfortably

noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  no
active:  I want the doctor's advice
noverb:  help
noverb:  too
active:  It's
active:  about Isa. He has not been home for two days

noverb:  about him
active:  It was not the first time
active:  she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble
noverb:  to me as a doctor
noverb:  to my wife as an old friend and school companion
active:  We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find
active:  Did she know
active:  her husband was
active:  Was it possible
noverb:  we could bring him back to her
active:  It seems
active:  it was
active:  She had the surest information
noverb:  of late he had

noverb:  made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City
passive: Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day
active:  he had come back
noverb:  twitching
noverb:  shattered
noverb:  in the evening
active:  now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours
active:  he lay there
noverb:  doubtless among the dregs of the docks
noverb:  breathing in the poison
noverb:  sleeping off the effects
noverb:  There
active:  he was to be found
active:  she was sure
noverb:  of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane
active:  was she
active:  to do
active:  could
active:  she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
active:  pluck her husband out from among the ruffians
active:  surrounded him
active:  There was the case
active:  of course there was
noverb:  one way out of it
active:  Might I not escort her to this place
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  as a second thought
active:  should she come at all
active:  I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser
noverb:  such I had influence over him
active:  I could manage it better
active:  I were alone
active:  I promised her on my word
noverb:  I would send him home in a cab within two hours
active:  he were indeed at the address
active:  she had given me
noverb:  And
noverb:  in ten minutes
active:  I had left my armchair
noverb:  cheery sitting-room behind me
active:  was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand
novoice: it seemed to me at the time
active:  the future only could show
noverb:  strange it was
active:  to be
active:  there was no great difficulty
noverb:  in the first stage of my adventure
noverb:  Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
active:  line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge
noverb:  Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop
passive: approached
active:  by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap
noverb:  the mouth of a cave
active:  I found the den of
active:  I was in search
noverb:  Ordering my cab
active:  to wait
active:  I passed down the steps
noverb:  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet
active:  and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
noverb:  made my way into a long, low room
noverb:  thick
noverb:  heavy with the brown opium smoke
novoice: terraced with wooden berths
noverb:  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
active:  Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies
active:  lying in strange fantastic poses
noverb:  bowed shoulders
noverb:  bent knees
noverb:  heads thrown back
active:  chins pointing upward
noverb:  with here
noverb:  there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer
noverb:  Out of the black shadows
active:  there glimmered little red circles of light
noverb:  now bright
noverb:  now faint
noverb:  as the burning poison waxed
novoice: waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
noverb:  The most lay silent
noverb:  some muttered to themselves
novoice: others talked together in a strange
noverb:  low
noverb:  monotonous voice
noverb:  their conversation coming in gushes
active:  suddenly tailing off into silence
noverb:  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
active:  At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal
noverb:  beside
active:  on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall
noverb:  thin old man
active:  with his jaw resting upon his two fists
noverb:  his elbows upon his knees
noverb:  staring into the fire
active:  I entered
active:  a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me
noverb:  a supply of the drug
active:  beckoning me to an empty berth
active:  Thank you
active:  I have not come
active:  to stay
active:  said I.
active:  There is a friend
noverb:  of mine here
noverb:  Mr. Isa Whitney
active:  I wish
active:  to speak with him
active:  There was a movement
noverb:  an exclamation from my right
active:  peering through the gloom
active:  I saw Whitney
noverb:  pale, haggard, and unkempt
active:  staring out at me
noverb:  My God
active:  It's Watson
active:  said he
active:  He was in a pitiable state of reaction
noverb:  with every nerve in a twitter
active:  I say
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  o'clock is it
noverb:  Nearly eleven
noverb:  Of
noverb:  day
noverb:  Of Friday
noverb:  June 19th
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I thought
active:  it was Wednesday
active:  It is Wednesday
noverb:  d'you want
active:  to frighten a chap for
active:  He sank his face onto his arms
active:  began
active:  to sob in a high treble key
active:  I tell you
active:  it is Friday
noverb:  man
active:  Your wife has been waiting this two days for you
active:  You should be ashamed
noverb:  of yourself
active:  I am
noverb:  you've got mixed
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  for I have only been here a few hours
noverb:  three pipes
noverb:  four pipes
active:  I forget
noverb:  many
active:  But I'll go home with you
noverb:  I wouldn't frighten Kate
noverb:  poor little Kate
noverb:  Give me your hand
noverb:  Have you a cab
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have one waiting
active:  I shall go in
noverb:  it
active:  But I must owe something
noverb:  Find
active:  I owe
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am all
noverb:  off colour
active:  I can do nothing for myself
active:  I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers
active:  holding my breath
active:  to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug
noverb:  looking about for the manager
active:  As I passed the tall man
active:  sat by the brazier
active:  I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt
noverb:  a low voice whispered
noverb:  Walk past me
noverb:  look back at me
noverb:  The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
active:  I glanced down
active:  They could only have come from the old man at my side
active:  he sat now
noverb:  very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age
noverb:  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees
noverb:  as
active:  it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
active:  I took two steps forward
active:  looked back
active:  It took all my self-control
active:  to prevent me
active:  breaking out into a cry of astonishment
active:  He had turned his back
active:  that none could see him
active:  I. His form had filled out
passive: his wrinkles were gone
active:  the dull eyes had regained their fire
noverb:  there
noverb:  sitting by the fire
noverb:  grinning at my surprise
noverb:  was none other than Sherlock Holmes
active:  He made a slight motion to me
active:  to approach him
noverb:  as he turned his face half round to the company once
novoice: subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I whispered
noverb:  on earth are you doing in this den
active:  you can
active:  he answered
active:  I have excellent ears
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to get rid of that sottish friend of yours
active:  I should be exceedingly glad
active:  to have a little talk with you
active:  I have a cab
active:  pray
noverb:  send him home in it
active:  You may safely trust him
noverb:  for he appears to be too limp
active:  to get into any mischief
active:  I should recommend you also
active:  to send a note by the cabman to your wife
active:  to say
active:  you have thrown in your lot with me
active:  you will wait
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in five minutes
active:  It was difficult
active:  to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests
noverb:  for they were always
noverb:  exceedingly definite
noverb:  put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
active:  I felt
noverb:  however
active:  Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission
passive: was practically accomplished
noverb:  and for the rest
active:  I could not wish anything better
noverb:  than
passive: to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures
active:  were the normal condition of his existence
active:  In a few minutes I had written my note
active:  paid Whitney's bill
active:  led him out to the cab
noverb:  seen him driven through the darkness
active:  In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
active:  I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes
active:  For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
active:  glancing quickly round
active:  he straightened himself out
noverb:  burst into a hearty fit of laughter
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  you imagine
active:  I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections
noverb:  all the other little weaknesses on
active:  you have favoured me with your medical views
passive: I was certainly surprised
noverb:  to find you there
noverb:  not
noverb:  I
active:  to find you
active:  I came to find a friend
noverb:  And I
active:  to find an enemy
noverb:  An enemy
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  one of my natural enemies
active:  shall I say
noverb:  my natural prey
noverb:  Briefly,
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry
active:  I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
active:  I have done
noverb:  now
passive: Had I been recognised in that den my life
noverb:  would not have been worth an hour's purchase
noverb:  for I have used it
noverb:  now for my own purposes
noverb:  the rascally Lascar
active:  runs
active:  it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
active:  There is a trap-door at the back of
noverb:  building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf,
active:  could tell some strange tales of
active:  has passed through
noverb:  it upon the moonless nights
active:  You do not mean bodies
noverb:  Ay,
noverb:  bodies
noverb:  Watson
active:  We should be rich men
active:  we had $1000 for every poor devil
passive: has been done to death in that den
active:  It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside
active:  I fear
active:  Neville St. Clair has entered it never
active:  to leave it
active:  our trap should be here
active:  He put his two forefingers between his teeth
novoice: whistled shrilly
noverb:  a signal
passive: was answered by a similar whistle from the distance
novoice: followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom
active:  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
active:  You'll come with me
noverb:  won't you
active:  I can be of use
noverb:  Oh
active:  a trusty comrade is always of use
noverb:  and a chronicler still
active:  My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one
noverb:  The Cedars
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is Mr. St. Clair's house
active:  I am staying there
active:  I conduct the inquiry
active:  Where is it
noverb:  Near Lee
noverb:  in Kent
active:  We have a seven-mile drive
noverb:  us
active:  I am all
noverb:  in the dark
active:  course
active:  you are
active:  You'll know all about it presently
noverb:  Jump up here
noverb:  All right
noverb:  John
active:  we shall not need you
noverb:  Here's half a crown
noverb:  Look out for me to-morrow
noverb:  about eleven
active:  Give her her head
noverb:  long
active:  He flicked the horse with his whip
active:  we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre
noverb:  deserted streets
active:  widened gradually
active:  we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge
noverb:  with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
noverb:  Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks
noverb:  mortar
noverb:  its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman
noverb:  the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers
active:  A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky
noverb:  a star
novoice: two twinkled dimly here
noverb:  there through the rifts of the clouds
active:  Holmes drove in silence
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  the air of a man
passive: is lost in thought
active:  I sat beside him
noverb:  curious
active:  to learn
active:  this new quest might be
active:  seemed to tax his powers
noverb:  sorely
noverb:  afraid
active:  to break in upon the current of his thoughts
active:  We had driven several miles
active:  were beginning
active:  to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas
active:  he shook himself
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  lit up his pipe with the air of a man
active:  has satisfied himself
active:  he is acting for the best
active:  You have a grand gift of silence
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
noverb:  Pon my word
active:  it is a great thing
noverb:  for me
active:  to have someone
active:  to talk to
active:  for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant
active:  I was wondering
active:  I should say to this dear little woman to-night
active:  she meets me at the door
active:  You forget
active:  I know nothing about it
noverb:  I shall just have time
noverb:  to tell you the facts of the case
active:  we get to Lee
active:  It seems absurdly simple
active:  somehow I can get nothing
active:  to go upon
active:  There's plenty of thread
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  I can't get the end of it into my hand
noverb:  Now,
active:  I'll state the case clearly
active:  concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark
noverb:  all is dark to me
active:  Proceed
noverb:  Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman
noverb:  Neville St. Clair by name
active:  appeared to have plenty of money
active:  He took a large villa
passive: laid out the grounds very nicely

noverb:  a man
noverb:  who is popular
noverb:  with all

noverb:  his whole debts at the present moment
active:  we have been able
active:  to ascertain
noverb:  amount to $88 10s
active:  he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank
active:  There is no reason
noverb:  therefore
active:  to think
active:  money troubles have been weighing upon his mind
active:  Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
noverb:  usual
active:  remarking
active:  he started
active:  he had two important commissions
active:  to perform
active:  he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  by the merest chance
active:  his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday
noverb:  very shortly after his departure
noverb:  to the effect
noverb:  a small parcel of considerable value
active:  she had been expecting

active:  she rushed down the steps
noverb:  for the house was none other than the opium den in

noverb:  There was no sign of him there
noverb:  In fact
noverb:  in the whole of
active:  floor
active:  there was no one
noverb:  to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect
active:  it seems
noverb:  made his home there
noverb:  he
active:  the Lascar stoutly swore

noverb:  determined was their denial
passive: the inspector was staggered
active:  had almost come to believe
passive: Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded
active:  , with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
noverb:  lay upon the table

active:  Out of the window he must apparently have gone
passive: for no other exit could be discovered

passive: to be immediately implicated in the matter
passive: The Lascar was known
active:  to be a man of the vilest antecedents
noverb:  as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known
novoice: to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window
active:  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
active:  His defence was one of absolute ignorance
active:  he protested
active:  he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone
noverb:  his lodger
active:  he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes
noverb:  much for the Lascar manager

active:  Surely your medical experience would tell you
noverb:  Watson
passive: weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
active:  Pray
active:  continue your narrative
active:  Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window
passive: she was escorted home in a cab by the police
active:  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
noverb:  Inspector Barton
active:  had charge of the case
active:  made a very careful examination of the premises
noverb:  without finding anything
active:  threw any light upon the matter
passive: One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone

active:  he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar
passive: this fault was soon remedied
passive: he was seized and searched
passive: without anything being found

active:  it is true
noverb:  , some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve
noverb:  ,
active:  he pointed to his ring-finger
passive: had been cut near the nail
active:  explained
active:  the bleeding came from there

active:  he had been to the window not long before

active:  had been observed there
active:  came doubtless from the same source
noverb:  He
active:  denied strenuously
novoice: having
noverb:  seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  swore
active:  the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police
noverb:  As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion
active:  she had actually seen her husband at the window
active:  he declared
active:  she must have been
noverb:  mad
noverb:  dreaming
passive: He was removed
passive: loudly protesting
noverb:  to the police-station
active:  the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope
active:  the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
active:  And it did
passive: they hardly found upon the mud-bank
active:  they had feared
active:  to find
active:  It was Neville St. Clair's coat
noverb:  not Neville St. Clair
active:  lay uncovered
active:  the tide receded
noverb:  And
active:  do you think
passive: they found in the pockets
active:  I cannot imagine
noverb:  No
noverb:  I don't think
active:  you would guess
active:  Every pocket stuffed with pennies
noverb:  half-pennies
noverb:  421 pennies and 270 half-pennies
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that it had not been swept away by the tide
active:  a human body is a different matter
active:  There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
active:  It seemed likely enough
active:  the weighted coat had remained
passive: the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
active:  I understand
passive: all the other clothes were found in the room
active:  Would the body
passive: be dressed in a coat alone
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
passive: the facts might be met speciously enough
active:  Suppose
active:  this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window
active:  there is no human eye
active:  could have seen the deed
active:  would
active:  he do
active:  It would of course
active:  strike him
active:  he must get rid of the tell-tale garments
active:  He would seize the coat
active:  be in the act
active:  throwing it out
active:  it would occur to him
active:  it would swim
noverb:  not sink
active:  He has little time
noverb:  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
novoice: the wife tried
active:  to force her way up
active:  perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate
active:  the police are hurrying up the street
active:  There is not an instant
passive: to be lost
active:  He rushes to some secret hoard
active:  he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary
active:  he stuffs all the coins upon
active:  he can lay his hands into the pockets
active:  to make sure of the coat's sinking
active:  He throws it out
active:  would have done the same with the other garments
active:  had not he heard the rush of steps below
noverb:  only just had time
active:  to close the window
active:  the police appeared
active:  It certainly sounds feasible
noverb:  Well,
active:  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better
noverb:  Boone
active:  I have told you
passive: was arrested and taken to the station
passive: it could not be shown
active:  there had
active:  been anything against him
active:  He had
passive: for years been known as a professional beggar
novoice: his life appeared
active:  to have been a very quiet
noverb:  innocent one
noverb:  There the matter stands at present
noverb:  the questions
active:  have to be solved
active:  --what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as
active:  I confess
active:  I cannot recall any case within my experience
active:  looked at the first glance
noverb:  simple
noverb:  yet
active:  presented such difficulties
active:  Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
active:  we had been whirling
passive: through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind
active:  we rattled along with a country hedge upon
noverb:  side of us
noverb:  Just as he finished
noverb:  however
active:  we drove through two scattered villages
active:  a few lights still glimmered in the windows
active:  We are on the outskirts of Lee
active:  said my companion
active:  We have touched on three English counties in our short drive
noverb:  starting in Middlesex
noverb:  passing over an angle of Surrey
noverb:  ending in Kent
noverb:  See
active:  light among the trees
active:  That is The Cedars
active:  beside that lamp sits a woman
passive: anxious ears have already
active:  I have little doubt
active:  caught the clink of our horse's feet
active:  are you not conducting the case from Baker Street
active:  I asked
active:  there are many inquiries
passive: must be made out here
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal
active:  you may rest assured
active:  she will have nothing
noverb:  a welcome for my friend and colleague
active:  I hate to meet her
noverb:  Watson
active:  I have no news of her husband
noverb:  Here we are
noverb:  Whoa
noverb:  there
noverb:  whoa
active:  We had pulled up in front of a large villa
novoice: stood within its own grounds
active:  A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head
active:  springing down
active:  I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
active:  led to the house
active:  we approached
active:  the door flew open
novoice: a little blonde woman stood in the opening
noverb:  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie
noverb:  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
active:  She stood
novoice: with her figure outlined against the flood of light
noverb:  one hand upon the door
noverb:  one half-raised in her eagerness
noverb:  her body slightly bent
noverb:  , her head
novoice: face protruded
noverb:  with eager eyes
noverb:  parted lips
noverb:  a standing question
noverb:  Well
active:  she cried
noverb:  well
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  there were two of us
noverb:  , she gave a cry of hope
active:  sank into a groan as she
active:  saw
active:  my companion shook his head
active:  shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  No good news
noverb:  None
noverb:  No bad
noverb:  No
noverb:  Thank God for that
active:  come in
active:  You must be weary
noverb:  , for you have had a long day
active:  This is my friend, Dr. Watson
active:  He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases
active:  a lucky chance has made it possible for me
active:  to bring him out
active:  associate him with this investigation
passive: I am delighted
active:  to see you
active:  said she
active:  pressing my hand warmly
active:  You will
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , forgive anything
active:  may be wanting in our arrangements
active:  you consider the blow
active:  has come
noverb:  suddenly upon us
noverb:  My dear madam
active:  said I
active:  I am an old campaigner
active:  I were not
active:  I can very well see
passive: no apology is needed
active:  If I can be of any assistance
noverb:  to you
noverb:  to my friend here
active:  I shall be indeed happy
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said the lady
active:  we entered a well-lit dining-room
noverb:  upon the table of
passive: a cold supper had been laid out
active:  I should very much
noverb:  like to ask you one or two plain questions
noverb:  to
active:  I beg
active:  you will give a plain answer
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  madam
active:  Do not trouble about my feelings
active:  I am not hysterical
noverb:  ,
noverb:  given
active:  to fainting
active:  I simply wish to hear your real
noverb:  real opinion
noverb:  Upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  In your heart of hearts
active:  do you think
active:  Neville is alive
active:  Sherlock Holmes seemed
passive: to be embarrassed by the question
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  now
active:  she repeated
noverb:  standing upon the rug
noverb:  looking keenly down at him
active:  he leaned back in a basket-chair
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  madam
active:  I do not
active:  You think
active:  he is dead
active:  I do
noverb:  Murdered
noverb:  I don't say that
noverb:  Perhaps
noverb:  And on
noverb:  day did he meet his death
noverb:  On Monday
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to explain
active:  it is
active:  I have received a letter from him to-day
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as
passive: he had been galvanised
active:  he roared
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  to-day
active:  She stood smiling
active:  holding up a little slip of paper in the air
active:  May I see it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  He snatched it from her in his eagerness
active:  smoothing it out upon the table
active:  he drew over the lamp
active:  examined it intently
active:  I had left my chair
active:  was gazing at it over his shoulder
noverb:  The envelope was a very coarse one
passive: was stamped with the Gravesend postmark
noverb:  with the date of that very day
noverb:  rather of the day before
active:  for it was considerably after midnight
noverb:  Coarse writing
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Surely this is not your husband's writing
noverb:  madam
noverb:  No
active:  the enclosure is
active:  I perceive also
active:  whoever addressed the envelope
passive: had
active:  to go and inquire as to the address
active:  can you tell that
noverb:  The name
noverb:  you see
active:  is in perfectly black ink
active:  has dried itself
active:  The rest is of the greyish colour
active:  shows
noverb:  blotting-paper has been used
passive: it had been written straight off
novoice: blotted
active:  none would be of a deep black shade
active:  This man has written the name
active:  there has
active:  been a pause
active:  he wrote the address
active:  can only mean
active:  he was not familiar
noverb:  with it
active:  It is, of course, a trifle
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so important as trifles
noverb:  Let us now see the letter
noverb:  Ha! there has been an enclosure here
noverb:  Yes
active:  there was a ring
noverb:  His signet-ring
active:  And you are sure
active:  this is your husband's hand
noverb:  One of his hands
noverb:  One
noverb:  His hand
active:  he wrote hurriedly
active:  It is very unlike his usual writing
noverb:  I know it well
active:  Dearest do not
passive: be frightened
noverb:  All will come well
active:  There is a huge error
noverb:  which it may take some little time
active:  to rectify
noverb:  Wait in patience
noverb:  NEVILLE
passive: Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark
noverb:  Hum
active:  Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb
noverb:  Ha
passive: And the flap has been gummed
active:  I am not very much
noverb:  in error
noverb:  by a person
active:  had been chewing tobacco
active:  And you have no doubt
active:  it is your husband's hand, madam
noverb:  None
active:  Neville wrote those words
active:  And they were posted to-day at Gravesend
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair
active:  the clouds lighten
active:  I should not venture to say
active:  the danger is over
active:  he must be alive
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  this is a clever forgery
active:  to put us on the wrong scent
active:  The ring, after all, proves nothing
passive: It may have been taken from him
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  it is
active:  it is his very own writing
noverb:  Very well
active:  It may
noverb:  however
passive: have been written on Monday
active:  only posted to-day
active:  That is possible
active:  much may have happened between
noverb:  Oh
active:  you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes
active:  I know
noverb:  all is well with him
active:  There is so keen
noverb:  a sympathy between us
active:  I should know
active:  evil came upon him
noverb:  On the very day
noverb:  I saw him last
active:  he cut himself in the bedroom
noverb:  I in the dining-room rushed upstairs
noverb:  with the utmost certainty
active:  something had happened
active:  Do you think
active:  I would respond to such a trifle
active:  be ignorant of his death
active:  I have seen too much not to know
active:  the impression of a woman may be more valuable
noverb:  the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
active:  And in this letter
active:  you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence
active:  to corroborate your view
active:  your husband is alive and able
active:  to write letters
active:  should he remain away from
noverb:  you
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  It is unthinkable
active:  And on Monday he made no remarks
active:  leaving you
noverb:  No
passive: And you were surprised
active:  to see him in Swandam Lane
noverb:  Very much
active:  Was the window open
noverb:  Yes
active:  he might have called to
noverb:  you
active:  He might
noverb:  He only
active:  I understand
active:  gave an inarticulate cry
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  A call for help
active:  you thought
noverb:  Yes
active:  He waved his hands
active:  it might have been a cry of surprise
active:  Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him
active:  to throw up his hands
active:  It is possible
active:  And you thought
passive: he was pulled back
active:  He disappeared
noverb:  suddenly
active:  He might have leaped back
active:  You did not see anyone else in the room
noverb:  No
active:  this horrible man confessed
active:  to having been there
active:  the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  Your husband
active:  you could see
active:  had his ordinary clothes on
noverb:  without his collar or tie
active:  I distinctly saw his bare throat
active:  Had he
noverb:  spoken of Swandam Lane
noverb:  Never
active:  Had he ever showed any signs
active:  having taken opium
noverb:  Never
active:  Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair
noverb:  Those are the principal points about
active:  I wished to be absolutely clear
active:  We shall
active:  now have a little supper
noverb:  retire
noverb:  for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
noverb:  A large
passive: comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
active:  I was quickly between the sheets
noverb:  for
active:  I was weary
noverb:  after my night of adventure
active:  Sherlock Holmes was a man
noverb:  however
active:  he had an unsolved problem upon his mind
active:  would go for days
active:  even for a week, without rest, turning it over
active:  rearranging his facts
active:  looking at it from every point of view
active:  he had
active:  fathomed it
active:  convinced himself
active:  his data were insufficient
active:  It was soon evident
noverb:  to me
active:  he was
active:  now preparing for an all-night sitting
active:  He took off his coat
noverb:  waistcoat
noverb:  put on a large blue dressing-gown
novoice: wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed
noverb:  cushions from the sofa and armchairs
noverb:  With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan
noverb:  upon
active:  he perched himself cross-legged
novoice: with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
noverb:  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there
noverb:  an old briar pipe between his lips
noverb:  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling
active:  the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless
noverb:  with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features
active:  he sat as
active:  I dropped off
active:  to sleep
active:  he sat
active:  a sudden ejaculation caused me
active:  to wake up
active:  I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
active:  The pipe was still between his lips
noverb:  the smoke still curled upward
active:  the room was full of a dense tobacco haze
novoice: nothing remained of the heap of shag
active:  I had seen upon the previous night
noverb:  Awake
noverb:  Watson
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Game for a morning drive
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  dress
active:  No one is stirring yet
active:  I know
noverb:  the stable-boy sleeps
active:  we shall soon have the trap out
active:  He chuckled to himself as he
active:  spoke
novoice: his eyes twinkled
active:  he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
active:  I dressed
active:  I glanced at my watch
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that no one was stirring
active:  It was twenty-five minutes past four
active:  I had hardly finished
active:  Holmes returned with the news
active:  the boy was putting in the horse
active:  I want to test a little theory of mine
active:  said he
noverb:  pulling on his boots
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe
active:  I deserve
passive: to be kicked from here to Charing Cross
active:  But I think
active:  I have the key of the affair now
active:  And where is it
active:  I asked
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  In the bathroom
active:  he answered
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I am not joking
active:  he continued
active:  seeing my look of incredulity
active:  I have just been there
active:  I have taken it out
active:  I have got it in this Gladstone bag
active:  Come on
noverb:  my boy
active:  we shall see
active:  it will not fit the lock
active:  We made our way downstairs
noverb:  possible
noverb:  out into the bright morning sunshine
active:  In the road stood our horse
noverb:  trap
noverb:  with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head
noverb:  We
active:  sprang in
noverb:  away we dashed down the London Road
active:  A few country carts were stirring
noverb:  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis
noverb:  the lines of villas on
active:  side were as silent
noverb:  lifeless as some city in a dream
active:  It has been in some points a singular case
active:  said Holmes
active:  flicking the horse on into a gallop
active:  I confess
active:  I have been
noverb:  a mole
active:  it is better
active:  to learn wisdom late
noverb:  never
active:  to learn it at all
active:  In town the earliest risers were just beginning
active:  to look sleepily from their windows
active:  we drove through the streets of the Surrey side
noverb:  Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road
active:  we crossed over the river
active:  dashing up Wellington Street
novoice: wheeled sharply to the right
active:  found ourselves in Bow Street
passive: Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force
active:  the two constables at the door saluted him
active:  One of them held the horse's head
active:  the other led us in
active:  is on duty
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Inspector Bradstreet
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Bradstreet
active:  are you
noverb:  A tall
active:  stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage
noverb:  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket
active:  I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Step into my room here
active:  It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table
active:  a telephone projecting from the wall
active:  The inspector sat down at his desk
active:  can
active:  I do for you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I called about that beggarman
noverb:  Boone
noverb:  the one
passive: was charged
passive: being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  of Lee
noverb:  Yes
passive: He was brought up
novoice: remanded for further inquiries
active:  I heard
noverb:  You have him here
noverb:  In the cells
noverb:  Is he quiet
noverb:  Oh
active:  he gives no trouble
active:  he is a dirty scoundrel
noverb:  Dirty
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is all
noverb:  we can do to make him wash his hands
active:  his face is
noverb:  a tinker's
noverb:  Well,
passive: once his case has been settled
active:  he will have a regular prison
active:  bath
active:  and I think
active:  you saw him
active:  you would agree with me
active:  he needed it
active:  I should like to see him very much
active:  Would you
passive: That is easily done
active:  Come this way
active:  You can leave your bag
noverb:  No
active:  I think
active:  I'll take it
noverb:  Very good
active:  Come this way
noverb:  you
active:  He led us down a passage
active:  opened a barred door
novoice: passed down a winding stair
active:  brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
active:  The third on the right is his
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
novoice: glanced through
active:  He is asleep
active:  said he
active:  You can see him very well
noverb:  We
novoice: put our eyes to the grating
noverb:  The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly
noverb:  heavily
active:  He was a middle-sized man
active:  coarsely clad
active:  became his calling
active:  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
active:  He was
active:  the inspector had said
noverb:  extremely dirty
noverb:  the grime
active:  covered his face
active:  could not conceal its repulsive ugliness
active:  A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin
active:  by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip
passive: three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
active:  A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
active:  He's a beauty
noverb:  isn't he
noverb:  said the inspector
active:  He certainly needs a wash
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I had an idea
active:  he might
active:  I took the liberty
active:  bringing the tools with me
active:  He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke
active:  took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge
noverb:  He! he
active:  You are a funny one
active:  chuckled the inspector
noverb:  Now,
active:  you will have the great goodness
active:  to open
noverb:  door very quietly
noverb:  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  not
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells
active:  does he
active:  He slipped his key into the lock
noverb:  we all very quietly entered the cell
active:  The sleeper half turned
novoice: settled down once
noverb:  into a deep slumber
active:  Holmes stooped to the water-jug
active:  moistened his sponge
active:  rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face
noverb:  Let me introduce you
active:  he shouted
noverb:  to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent
noverb:  Never in my life have I seen such a sight
novoice: The man's face peeled off under the sponge
noverb:  the bark from a tree
noverb:  Gone was the coarse brown tint
noverb:  Gone
noverb:  too
active:  was the horrid scar
active:  had seamed it across
noverb:  the twisted lip
active:  had given the repulsive sneer to the face
active:  A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
noverb:  there
novoice: sitting up in his bed
active:  was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man
noverb:  black-haired
noverb:  smooth-skinned
active:  rubbing his eyes
active:  staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
active:  suddenly realising the exposure
active:  he broke into a scream
active:  threw himself down with his face to the pillow
noverb:  Great heavens
active:  cried the inspector
active:  it is
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  the missing man
active:  I know him from the photograph
active:  The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man
active:  abandons himself to his destiny
active:  Be it
active:  said he
active:  And pray
active:  am I charged with
active:  making away with Mr. Neville St.
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
noverb:  you can't be charged with
active:  they make a case of attempted suicide of it
active:  said the inspector with a grin
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have been twenty-seven years in the force
noverb:  this really takes the cake
active:  I am Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  ,
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that no crime has been committed
noverb:  therefore
passive: I am illegally detained
noverb:  No crime
passive: a very great error has been committed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  You would have done better to have trusted you wife
active:  It was not the wife
active:  it was the children
active:  groaned the prisoner
active:  God help me
active:  I would not have them ashamed of their father
noverb:  My God
noverb:  an exposure
active:  can
active:  I do
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch
active:  patted him kindly on the shoulder
active:  you leave it to a court of law
active:  to clear the matter up
active:  said he
active:  course
active:  you can hardly avoid publicity
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  you convince the police authorities
active:  there is no possible case against you
active:  I do not know
active:  there is any reason
noverb:  that the details should find their way into the papers
active:  Inspector Bradstreet would
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , make notes upon anything
active:  you might tell us
active:  submit it to the proper authorities
active:  The case would
active:  never go into court at all
active:  God bless you
active:  cried the prisoner passionately
active:  I would have endured imprisonment
noverb:  ay
noverb:  even execution
noverb:  rather
active:  have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
active:  You are the first
active:  have ever heard my story
active:  My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield
active:  I received an excellent education
active:  I travelled in my youth
active:  took to the stage
active:  finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London
noverb:  One day my editor wished
active:  to have a series of articles
active:  begging in the metropolis
active:  I volunteered to supply them
active:  There was the point
noverb:  from
active:  all my adventures started
active:  It was only
active:  trying begging as an amateur
active:  I could get the facts upon
active:  to base my articles
noverb:  When an actor
active:  I had
noverb:  of course
active:  learned all the secrets
active:  making up
active:  had been famous in the green-room for my skill
active:  I took advantage now of my attainments
active:  I painted my face
active:  to make myself
noverb:  possible I made a good scar
active:  fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster
active:  with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city
noverb:  ostensibly as a match-seller
noverb:  really as a beggar
active:  For seven hours I plied my trade
active:  I returned home in the evening
passive: I found to my surprise
active:  I had received no less than 26s
noverb:  4d
active:  I wrote my articles
active:  thought little
noverb:  of the matter until
noverb:  some time later
active:  I backed a bill for a friend
active:  had a writ served upon me for $25
active:  I was at my wit's end
active:  to get the money
active:  a sudden idea came to me
active:  I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor
novoice: asked for a holiday from my employers
novoice: spent the time
active:  begging in the City under my disguise
active:  In ten days I had the money
active:  had paid the debt
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can imagine
noverb:  hard it was
active:  to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week
active:  I knew
active:  I could earn as much in a day
active:  smearing my face with a little paint
active:  laying my cap on the ground
noverb:  sitting still
active:  It was a long fight between my pride and the money
novoice: the dollars won at last
active:  I threw up reporting
noverb:  sat day after day in the corner
active:  I had first chosen
noverb:  inspiring pity by my ghastly face
active:  filling my pockets with coppers
active:  Only one man knew my secret
active:  He was the keeper
noverb:  of a low den in
active:  I used
active:  to lodge in Swandam Lane
active:  I could
active:  every morning emerge as a squalid beggar
active:  in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town
noverb:  This fellow, a Lascar
passive: was well paid by me for his rooms
active:  I knew
active:  my secret was safe in his possession
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  very soon I found
active:  I was saving considerable sums of money
active:  I do not mean
active:  any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--
active:  I had exceptional advantages in my power
active:  making up
noverb:  also in a facility of repartee
active:  improved by practice
active:  made me quite a recognised character in the City
noverb:  All day a stream of pennies
passive: varied by silver
novoice: poured in upon me
active:  it was a very bad day in
active:  I failed to take $2
active:  I grew richer
active:  I grew more ambitious
active:  took a house in the country
noverb:  eventually married
active:  without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
active:  My dear wife knew
active:  I had business in the City
active:  She little knew
active:  Last Monday I had finished for the day
active:  was dressing in my room above the opium den
active:  I looked out of my window
noverb:  saw
noverb:  to my horror and astonishment
active:  my wife was standing in the street
noverb:  with her eyes fixed full upon me
active:  I gave a cry of surprise
active:  threw up my arms
active:  to cover my face
active:  rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him
active:  to prevent anyone
active:  coming up to me
active:  I heard her voice downstairs
active:  I knew
active:  she could not ascend
active:  Swiftly I threw off my clothes
passive: pulled on those of a beggar
noverb:  put on my pigments and wig
active:  Even a wife's eyes could not pierce
active:  complete a disguise
active:  it occurred to me
active:  there might be a search
noverb:  in the room
active:  the clothes might betray me
noverb:  I threw open the window
active:  reopening by my violence a small cut
active:  I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning
active:  Then I seized my coat
passive: was weighted by the coppers
active:  I had just transferred to
noverb:  it from the leather bag in
active:  I carried my takings
active:  I hurled it out of the window
active:  it disappeared into the Thames
active:  The other clothes would have followed
noverb:  at that moment
active:  there was a rush of constables up the stair
noverb:  a few minutes after I found
noverb:  rather
active:  I confess
noverb:  to my relief
noverb:  instead
passive: being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair
passive: I was arrested as his murderer
active:  I do not know
active:  there is anything
noverb:  else for me
active:  to explain
passive: I was determined
active:  to preserve my disguise
noverb:  possible
noverb:  hence my preference for a dirty face
active:  Knowing
active:  my wife would be terribly anxious
active:  I slipped off my ring
active:  confided it to the Lascar at a moment
active:  no constable was watching me
noverb:  together with a hurried scrawl
active:  telling her
active:  she had no cause
active:  to fear
noverb:  That note only reached her yesterday
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Good God
noverb:  a week
active:  she must have spent
active:  The police have watched this Lascar
active:  said Inspector Bradstreet
active:  and I can quite understand
active:  he might find it difficult
active:  to post a letter unobserved
active:  Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his
active:  forgot all about it for some days
active:  That was it
active:  said Holmes
active:  nodding approvingly
active:  I have no doubt of it
passive: have
passive: you never been prosecuted for begging
noverb:  Many times
active:  was a fine to me
active:  It must stop here
noverb:  however
active:  said Bradstreet
active:  the police are to hush this thing up
active:  there must be no
noverb:  more of Hugh Boone
active:  I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths
active:  a man can take
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that no further steps may be taken
passive: you are found again
noverb:  all must come out
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  we are very much indebted to you
active:  having cleared the matter up
active:  I wish
active:  I knew
active:  you reach your results
active:  I reached this one
active:  said my friend
active:  sitting upon five pillows
active:  consuming an ounce of shag
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we drive to Baker Street
active:  we shall just be in time for breakfast
noverb:  VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
active:  I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas
noverb:  with the intention
noverb:  wishing him the compliments of the season
active:  He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown
noverb:  a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right
noverb:  a pile of crumpled morning papers
noverb:  evidently newly studied
noverb:  near at hand
active:  Beside the couch was a wooden chair
active:  on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
noverb:  disreputable hard-felt hat
noverb:  much the worse for wear
novoice: cracked in several places
noverb:  A lens
noverb:  a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested
passive: the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
passive: You are engaged
active:  said I
active:  perhaps I interrupt you
noverb:  Not at all
active:  I am glad
active:  to have a friend with
active:  I can discuss my results
active:  The matter is a perfectly trivial one
noverb:  --he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--
novoice: there are points in connection with it
active:  are not entirely devoid of interest
noverb:  even of instruction
active:  I seated myself in his armchair
active:  warmed my hands
noverb:  his crackling fire
active:  for a sharp frost had set in
active:  the windows were thick with the ice crystals
active:  I suppose
active:  I remarked
noverb:  homely as it looks
noverb:  this thing has some deadly story linked on to it
active:  it is the clue
noverb:  which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  No crime
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Only one of those whimsical little incidents
active:  will happen
noverb:  you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
noverb:  Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity
passive: every possible combination of events may be expected
active:  to take place
noverb:  many a little problem will be presented
active:  may be striking
noverb:  bizarre
active:  being criminal
active:  We have already had experience of such
noverb:  much
active:  I remarked
noverb:  of the last six cases
active:  I have added to my notes
active:  three have been entirely free of any legal crime
noverb:  Precisely
active:  You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland,
noverb:  to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
active:  You know Peterson, the commissionaire
noverb:  Yes
active:  It is to him
active:  this trophy belongs
active:  It is his hat
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  he found it
active:  Its owner is unknown
active:  I beg
active:  you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
noverb:  as an intellectual problem
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  as to
active:  it came here
active:  It arrived upon Christmas morning
noverb:  in company with a good fat goose
active:  is
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire
active:  The facts are these
noverb:  about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson
active:  you know
active:  is a very honest fellow
active:  was returning from some small jollification
active:  was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road
active:  In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man
noverb:  walking with a slight stagger
active:  carrying a white goose
novoice: slung over his shoulder
active:  he reached the corner of Goodge Street
active:  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs
active:  One of the latter knocked off the man's hat
noverb:  on
active:  he raised his stick
active:  to defend himself
active:  swinging it over his head
active:  smashed the shop window behind him
active:  Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants
noverb:  the man
noverb:  shocked
active:  having broken the window
active:  seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
active:  dropped his goose
active:  took to his heels
novoice: vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets
noverb:  lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road
active:  The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson
passive: he was left in possession of the field of battle
noverb:  also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
active:  surely he restored to their owner
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  there lies the problem
active:  It is true
noverb:  that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card
passive: was tied to the bird's left leg
active:  it is also true
noverb:  that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat
active:  there are some thousands of Bakers
noverb:  ,
noverb:  some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours
active:  it is not easy
active:  to restore lost property to any one of them
active:  did Peterson
active:  do
active:  He brought round
noverb:  hat
noverb:  goose to me on Christmas morning
noverb:  knowing
active:  even the smallest problems are of interest to me
noverb:  The goose
active:  we retained until this morning
active:  there were signs
noverb:  in spite of the slight frost
active:  it would be well
passive: it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
active:  Its finder has carried it off
noverb:  therefore
active:  to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
active:  I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman
active:  lost his Christmas dinner
active:  Did he not advertise
noverb:  No
noverb:  clue could you have as to his identity
noverb:  Only
active:  we can deduce
noverb:  From his hat
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you are joking
active:  can you gather from this old battered felt
active:  Here is my lens
active:  You know my methods
active:  can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man
active:  has worn this article
active:  I took the tattered object in my hands
active:  turned it over rather ruefully
active:  It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape
noverb:  hard
noverb:  much the worse for wear
active:  The lining had been of red silk
passive: was a good deal discoloured
active:  There was no maker's name
active:  Holmes had remarked
noverb:  the initials
noverb:  H. B.
passive: were scrawled upon one side
passive: It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer
active:  the elastic was missing
noverb:  For the rest
passive: it was cracked
noverb:  exceedingly dusty
novoice: spotted in several places
novoice: there seemed
active:  to have been some attempt
active:  to hide the discoloured patches
active:  smearing them with ink
active:  I can see nothing
active:  said I
active:  handing it back to my friend
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  Watson
active:  you can see everything
active:  You fail
noverb:  however
active:  to reason from
active:  you see
active:  You are too timid
noverb:  in drawing your inferences
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  it is
active:  you can infer from this hat
active:  He picked it up
active:  gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
active:  was characteristic of him
active:  It is perhaps less suggestive
noverb:  than it might
passive: have been
active:  he remarked
noverb:  and
active:  there are a few inferences
noverb:  which are very distinct
noverb:  a few others
active:  represent at least a strong balance of probability
active:  the man was highly intellectual
active:  is of course obvious upon the face of it
noverb:  also
active:  he was fairly well-to
noverb:  -do within the last three years
active:  he has now fallen upon evil days
active:  He had foresight
novoice: has less now
noverb:  formerly
active:  pointing to a moral retrogression
passive: taken with the decline of his fortunes
active:  seems to indicate some evil influence
noverb:  probably drink
noverb:  at work upon him
active:  This may account also for the obvious fact
active:  his wife has ceased to love him
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  He has
noverb:  however
active:  retained some degree of self-respect
active:  he continued
active:  disregarding my remonstrance
active:  He is a man
noverb:  who leads a sedentary life
active:  goes out little
active:  is out of training entirely
active:  is middle-aged
active:  has grizzled hair
active:  he has
active:  had cut within the last few days
active:  he anoints with lime-cream
noverb:  These are the more patent facts
active:  are to be deduced from his hat
noverb:  Also,
noverb:  by the way
active:  it is extremely improbable
noverb:  that he has gas laid on in his house
active:  You are certainly joking
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Is it possible
noverb:  even now
noverb:  I give you these results
active:  you are unable
active:  to see
passive: they are attained
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am very stupid
active:  I must confess
active:  I am unable
active:  to follow you
noverb:  For example
active:  did you deduce
active:  this man was intellectual
active:  For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head
active:  It came right over the forehead
novoice: settled upon the bridge of his nose
active:  It is a question of cubic capacity
active:  said he
noverb:  a man with
noverb:  large a brain must have something in it
noverb:  The decline of his fortunes
active:  This hat is three years old
passive: These flat brims curled
active:  at the edge came in
active:  It is a hat of the very best quality
noverb:  Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining
active:  this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago
active:  has had no hat
active:  he has assuredly gone down in the world
noverb:  Well,
active:  is clear enough
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  about the foresight and the moral retrogression
active:  Sherlock Holmes laughed
active:  Here is the foresight
active:  said
active:  he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
passive: They are never sold upon hats
active:  this man ordered one
active:  it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight
active:  he went out of his way
active:  to take this precaution against the wind
active:  we see
active:  he has broken the elastic
active:  has not troubled to replace it
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that he has less foresight now
noverb:  formerly
active:  is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt
active:  daubing them with ink
active:  is a sign
active:  he has not entirely lost his self-respect
active:  Your reasoning is certainly plausible
noverb:  The further points
active:  he is middle-aged
noverb:  ,
passive: his hair is grizzled
passive: it has been recently cut
noverb:  he uses lime-cream
noverb:  , are all
passive: to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining
active:  The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends
noverb:  clean cut by the scissors of the barber
noverb:  They all appear to be adhesive
active:  there is a distinct odour of lime-cream
noverb:  This dust
active:  you will observe
active:  is not the gritty, grey dust of the street
noverb:  the fluffy brown dust of the house
active:  showing
passive: it has been hung up indoors
noverb:  of the time
noverb:  the marks of moisture upon the
active:  are proof positive
active:  the wearer perspired very freely
active:  could therefore
active:  hardly be in the best of training
noverb:  his wife
active:  you said
active:  she had ceased to love him

active:  Remember the card upon the bird's leg
active:  You have an answer to everything
noverb:  on earth do you deduce
passive: the gas is not laid on in his house
active:  One tallow stain
noverb:  even two
active:  might come by chance
active:  I see no less than five
active:  I think
active:  there can be little doubt
passive: the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow
noverb:  walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet
active:  Are you satisfied
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is very ingenious
active:  said I
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  as you said just now
active:  there has been no crime committed
active:  no harm done save the loss of a goose
noverb:  all this seems to be rather a waste of energy

active:  the door flew open
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  the commissionaire
active:  rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man
passive: is dazed with astonishment

noverb:  an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand

noverb:  he
active:  this is treasure trove indeed
active:  I suppose
active:  you know
active:  you have got
noverb:  A diamond
noverb:  sir
noverb:  A precious stone
active:  It cuts into glass as
active:  it were putty
active:  It's more than a precious stone
active:  It is the precious stone
noverb:  Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  Precisely
active:  I ought to know its size
noverb:  shape
noverb:  seeing
active:  I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately
active:  It is absolutely unique
noverb:  ,
passive: its value can only be conjectured
passive: the reward offered
active:  of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
noverb:  A thousand pounds
noverb:  Great Lord of mercy
novoice: The commissionaire plumped down into a chair
novoice: stared from one to the other of us
active:  That is the reward

active:  having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case
noverb:  The evidence
active:  against him was so strong
noverb:  that the case has been referred to the Assizes
active:  I have some account of the matter here
active:  I believe
active:  He rummaged amid his newspapers
active:  glancing over the dates
noverb:  until at last he smoothed one out
active:  doubled it over
active:  read
noverb:  the following paragraph

novoice: fainted away at the conclusion
passive: was carried out of court
noverb:  Hum
noverb:  much for the police-court
active:  said Holmes thoughtfully
noverb:  tossing aside the paper
noverb:  The question for us now
active:  to solve
noverb:  is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important
noverb:  less innocent aspect
active:  Here is the stone
active:  the stone came from the goose
active:  the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with
active:  I have bored you
active:  now we must set ourselves very seriously
active:  to finding this gentleman
active:  ascertaining
noverb:  part he has played in this little mystery
active:  To do this
active:  we must try the simplest means first
noverb:  these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers

noverb:  Well,
active:  he is sure
active:  to keep an eye on the papers
active:  , to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one
active:  He was clearly
passive: scared by his mischance
active:  breaking the window
noverb:  by the approach of Peterson
noverb:  he thought of nothing
noverb:  flight
active:  he must have bitterly regretted the impulse
active:  caused him
active:  to drop his bird
noverb:  again
active:  the introduction of his name will cause him
active:  to see it
noverb:  for everyone
noverb:  knows him will direct his attention to it
noverb:  Here you are
noverb:  Peterson

active:  Thank you
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  just buy a goose on your way back
noverb:  leave it here with me
noverb:  for we must have one
active:  to give to this gentleman in place of the one
active:  your family is now devouring
active:  When the commissionaire had gone
active:  Holmes took up the stone
active:  held it against the light
active:  It's a bonny thing
active:  said he
noverb:  Just see
active:  it glints and sparkles
noverb:  Of course
active:  it is a nucleus and focus of crime
active:  Every good stone is
active:  They are the devil's pet baits
active:  In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
active:  This stone is not
noverb:  twenty years old
passive: It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China
active:  is remarkable
active:  having every characteristic of the carbuncle
active:  save
active:  it is blue
noverb:  in shade instead of ruby red
noverb:  In spite of its youth
active:  it has already a sinister history
active:  There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies
novoice: brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight
active:  crystallised charcoal
active:  would think
noverb:  pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison
active:  I'll lock it up in my strong box now
noverb:  drop a line to the Countess
active:  to say
active:  we have it
active:  Do you think
active:  this man Horner is innocent
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Well,
active:  do you imagine
active:  this other one, Henry Baker, had anything
active:  to do with the matter
active:  It is
active:  I think
noverb:  much more likely
active:  Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man
active:  had no idea
noverb:  the bird
active:  he was carrying
active:  was of considerably more value
passive: it were made of solid gold
noverb:  however
active:  I shall determine by a very simple test
active:  we have an answer to our advertisement
active:  And you can do nothing until
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I shall continue my professional round
active:  But I shall come back in the evening at the hour

noverb:  for I should like to see the solution of
active:  tangled a business
noverb:  Very glad
active:  to see you
active:  I dine at seven
active:  There is a woodcock
active:  I believe
active:  By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson
active:  to examine its crop
passive: I had been delayed at a case
active:  it was a little after half-past six
active:  I found myself in Baker Street once
active:  As I approached the house
active:  I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat

noverb:  in the bright semicircle
passive: was thrown from the fanlight
noverb:  Just
active:  I arrived the door
passive: was opened
passive: we were shown up together to Holmes' room
noverb:  Mr. Henry Baker
active:  I believe
active:  said he
noverb:  rising from his armchair
active:  greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality
active:  he could
active:  readily assume
noverb:  Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker
active:  It is a cold night
active:  I observe
active:  your circulation is more adapted for summer
noverb:  for winter
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have just come at the right time
active:  Is
noverb:  your hat, Mr. Baker
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that is undoubtedly my hat
active:  He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head,
noverb:  a broad, intelligent face
noverb:  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown
noverb:  A touch of red in nose
active:  cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits
noverb:  His rusty black frock-coat
passive: was buttoned right up in front
novoice: with the collar turned up
active:  his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
active:  He spoke in a slow staccato fashion
active:  choosing his words with care
active:  gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters
active:  had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune
active:  We have retained these things for some days
active:  said Holmes
active:  we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address
active:  I am at a loss
active:  to know now
active:  you did not advertise
active:  Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
active:  Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
active:  he remarked
active:  I had no doubt
noverb:  the gang of roughs
noverb:  assaulted me had carried off
noverb:  my hat and the bird
active:  I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt
active:  recovering them
noverb:  Very naturally
passive: By the way, about the bird, we were compelled
active:  to eat it
active:  To eat it
noverb:  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would have been
active:  of no use to anyone had we not done
active:  But I presume
noverb:  this other goose upon the sideboard
active:  is about the same weight
noverb:  perfectly fresh
active:  will answer your purpose equally well
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  certainly
active:  answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief
noverb:  Of course
active:  we still have the feathers, legs, crop
noverb:  on of your own bird
noverb:  you wish
noverb:  The man burst into a hearty laugh
active:  They might be useful
noverb:  to me as relics of my adventure
active:  said he
noverb:  beyond
active:  I can hardly see
noverb:  use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going
active:  to be to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I think
active:  , with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird
active:  I perceive upon the sideboard
novoice: Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
active:  There is your hat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  there your bird
active:  said he
noverb:  By the way
active:  would it bore you
active:  to tell me
active:  you got the other one from
active:  I am somewhat of a fowl fancier
active:  I have seldom seen a better grown goose
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  sir
active:  said Baker
active:  had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm
active:  There are a few of us
active:  frequent the Alpha Inn
noverb:  near the Museum
active:  we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day
active:  you understand
noverb:  This year our good host

noverb:  by
noverb:  on consideration of some few pence every week

active:  the rest is familiar to you
active:  I am much indebted
noverb:  to you
noverb:  sir
passive: for a Scotch bonnet is fitted
noverb:  to my years nor my gravity
active:  With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to
noverb:  of us
novoice: strode off upon his way
noverb:  much for Mr. Henry Baker
active:  said Holmes
active:  he had closed the door behind him
active:  It is quite certain
noverb:  that he knows nothing
noverb:  about the matter
active:  Are you hungry
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  Not particularly
active:  I suggest
active:  we turn our dinner into a supper
active:  follow up this clue
active:  it is still hot
noverb:  By all means
active:  It was a bitter night
active:  we drew on our ulsters
active:  wrapped cravats about our throats
active:  the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky
active:  the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
noverb:  so many pistol shots
active:  Our footfalls rang out crisply
noverb:  loudly
active:  we swung through the doctors' quarter
noverb:  Wimpole Street
noverb:  Harley Street
noverb:  through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street
active:  In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn
active:  is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets
noverb:  which runs down into Holborn
noverb:  Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar
active:  ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord
active:  Your beer should be excellent
active:  it is
noverb:  your geese
active:  said he
noverb:  My geese
active:  The man seemed surprised
noverb:  Yes
active:  I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  who was a member of your goose club
noverb:  Ah! yes
active:  I see
noverb:  you see
noverb:  sir
active:  them's not our geese

noverb:  prosperity to your house
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Now for Mr. Breckinridge
active:  he continued
active:  buttoning up his coat
active:  we came out into the frosty air
active:  Remember
noverb:  Watson
active:  we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain
active:  we have at the other a man
active:  will certainly get seven years' penal servitude
active:  we can establish his innocence
active:  It is possible
noverb:  that our inquiry may
active:  confirm his guilt
active:  , in any case, we have a line of investigation
passive: has been missed by the police
active:  a singular chance has placed in our hands
noverb:  Let us follow it out to the bitter end
noverb:  Faces to the south
noverb:  quick march
active:  We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street,
noverb:  through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market

noverb:  the proprietor a horsey-looking man
noverb:  with a sharp face
noverb:  trim side-whiskers was helping a boy
active:  to put up the shutters
noverb:  Good-evening
active:  It's a cold night
active:  said Holmes
novoice: The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
passive: Sold out of geese
active:  I see
active:  continued Holmes
noverb:  pointing at the bare slabs of marble
novoice: Let
active:  you have five hundred to-morrow morning
active:  That's no good
noverb:  Well,
active:  there are some
noverb:  on the stall with the gas-flare
noverb:  Ah
passive: I was recommended to
noverb:  you
noverb:  by
noverb:  The landlord of the Alpha
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  I sent him a couple of dozen
noverb:  Fine birds they were
noverb:  too
active:  Now where did you get them from
active:  To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  mister
active:  said he
novoice: with his head cocked
noverb:  his arms akimbo
active:  are you driving at
noverb:  Let's have it straight
noverb:  now
active:  It is straight enough
active:  I should like to know

active:  you supplied to the Alpha
noverb:  Well
noverb:  I shan't tell you
noverb:  now
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is a matter of no importance

active:  you should be so warm
noverb:  over such a trifle
noverb:  Warm
active:  You'd be
active:  warm
noverb:  maybe
active:  you were

active:  there should be an end of the business
active:  it's
active:  are the geese
noverb:  and 'Who did you sell the geese to
noverb:  and 'What will you take for the geese
active:  One would think
active:  they were the only geese
noverb:  in the world
active:  to hear the fuss
passive: is made over them
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no connection with any other people
active:  have been making inquiries
active:  said Holmes carelessly
noverb:  you won't tell us
active:  the bet is off
active:  that is all
noverb:  I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls
active:  I have a fiver on it
noverb:  the bird
active:  I ate
active:  is country
novoice: bred
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  you've lost your fiver
noverb:  for it's town
novoice: bred
active:  snapped the salesman
active:  It's nothing of the kind
active:  I say
active:  it is
noverb:  I don't believe it
noverb:  D'you think
active:  you know more about fowls
noverb:  I
active:  have handled them

noverb:  all those birds
active:  went to

active:  You'll never persuade me
active:  to believe that
active:  Will you bet
active:  It's merely taking your money
noverb:  for I know
active:  I am right
active:  But I'll have a sovereign on with you
noverb:  just
active:  to teach you not
active:  to be obstinate
active:  The salesman chuckled grimly
noverb:  Bring me the books
noverb:  Bill
active:  said he
active:  The small boy brought round a small thin volume
noverb:  a great greasy-backed one
active:  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
noverb:  Now
noverb:  Mr. Cocksure
active:  said the salesman
active:  I thought
active:  I was out of geese
active:  I finish
active:  you'll find
active:  there is still one left in my shop
active:  You see this little book
noverb:  Well
active:  That's the list of the folk from
active:  I buy
noverb:  D'you see
noverb:  Well,
active:  here on this page are the country folk
active:  the numbers after their names are

active:  to say now
active:  Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined
active:  He drew a sovereign from his pocket
active:  threw it down upon the slab
noverb:  turning away with the air of a man
active:  disgust is too deep for words
noverb:  A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post
active:  laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  When you see a man with whiskers of
noverb:  cut
noverb:  the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket
active:  you can always draw him by a bet
active:  said he
active:  I daresay
active:  I had put $100 down in front of him
noverb:  that man would not have given me such complete information
passive: was drawn from him by the idea
active:  he was doing me on a wager
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we are
active:  I fancy
active:  nearing the end of our quest
noverb:  the only point
active:  remains
passive: to be determined
active:  is
active:  we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night
active:  we should reserve it for to-morrow

active:  there are others
noverb:  besides ourselves
active:  are anxious
noverb:  about the matter
active:  I should
passive: His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub
active:  broke out from the stall
active:  we had just left
noverb:  Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
passive: was thrown by the swinging lamp
noverb:  Breckinridge
noverb:  the salesman
active:  framed in the door of his stall
active:  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
noverb:  I've had enough of you and your geese
active:  he shouted
active:  I wish
novoice: you were all
noverb:  at the devil together
active:  you come
active:  pestering me any
noverb:  with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you
active:  You bring Mrs. Oakshott here
active:  I'll answer her
active:  have you
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  Did I buy the geese off you
noverb:  No
active:  one of them was mine all the same
active:  whined the little man
noverb:  Well,
active:  ask Mrs. Oakshott for it
active:  She told me
active:  to ask you
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can ask the King of Proosia
noverb:  for all I care
noverb:  I've had enough of it
active:  Get out of this
active:  He rushed fiercely forward
active:  the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
noverb:  Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  Come with me
active:  we will see
active:  is to be made of this fellow
active:  Striding through the scattered knots of people

active:  my companion speedily overtook the little man
active:  touched him upon the shoulder
active:  He sprang round
active:  I could see in the gas-light
passive: every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
active:  are you
noverb:  do you want
active:  he asked in a quavering voice
active:  You will excuse me
active:  said Holmes blandly

noverb:  of a catastrophe
active:  he stepped into the cab
noverb:  in half an hour
active:  we were back
noverb:  in the sitting-room at Baker Street

noverb:  the high
noverb:  thin breathing of our new companion
noverb:  the claspings and unclaspings of his hands
noverb:  spoke of the nervous tension within him
noverb:  Here we are
active:  said Holmes cheerily
active:  we filed into the room
active:  The fire looks very seasonable in this weather
active:  You look cold
noverb:  Mr. Ryder

noverb:  sir
noverb:  Or rather

noverb:  white
noverb:  with a black bar across the tail
active:  Ryder quivered with emotion
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  sir
active:  he cried
active:  can you tell me
active:  it went to

noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  a most remarkable bird
active:  it proved

noverb:  uncertain
active:  to claim
active:  to disown it
noverb:  The game's up
noverb:  Ryder
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  Hold up
noverb:  man
active:  you'll be into the fire
active:  Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson

active:  Now he looks a little more human
noverb:  a shrimp
active:  it is
active:  to be sure
active:  For a moment he had staggered
noverb:  nearly fallen
novoice: the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks
active:  he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
active:  I have almost every link in my hands
noverb:  all the proofs
active:  I could possibly need
active:  there is little
noverb:  which you need
active:  tell me
noverb:  Still,
passive: that little may as well be cleared up
active:  to make the case complete
active:  You had heard
noverb:  Ryder
noverb:  of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?
active:  It was Catherine Cusack
noverb:  who told me of it
active:  said he in a crackling voice
active:  I see
noverb:  her ladyship's waiting-maid
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the temptation of sudden wealth
noverb:  easily acquired was too much for you
active:  it has been for better men
noverb:  you
active:  you were not very scrupulous
active:  in the means you used
active:  It seems to me
noverb:  Ryder
active:  there is the making
noverb:  of a very pretty villain in you
active:  You knew
passive: this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before
active:  that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--
active:  you managed
active:  he should be the man
novoice: sent for
active:  he had left

noverb:  You

novoice: clutched at my companion's knees
noverb:  For God's sake
active:  have mercy
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  Think of my father
noverb:  Of my mother
active:  It would break their hearts
active:  I never went wrong before
active:  I never will again
active:  I swear it
active:  I'll swear it on a Bible
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  don't bring it into court
noverb:  For Christ's sake
noverb:  don't
active:  Get back into your chair
active:  said Holmes sternly
active:  It is very well
active:  to cringe and crawl now
active:  you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of
active:  he knew nothing
active:  I will fly
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I will leave the country, sir
active:  the charge against him will break down
noverb:  Hum
active:  We will talk about that
noverb:  And now let us hear a true account of the next act
active:  came the stone into the goose
active:  came the goose into the open market
noverb:  Tell us the truth
active:  for there lies your only hope of safety
active:  Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
noverb:  I will tell you it just
novoice: it happened
noverb:  sir
active:  said he
passive: When Horner had been arrested
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  it would be best
noverb:  for me
active:  to get away with the stone at once
noverb:  for I did not know at
noverb:  moment the police might not take it into their heads
active:  to search me and my room
active:  There was no place
noverb:  about the hotel
active:  it would be safe
active:  I went out
noverb:  as
noverb:  on some commission
active:  I made for my sister's house
active:  She had married a man
active:  named Oakshott
novoice: lived in Brixton Road
active:  she fattened fowls for the market
noverb:  All the way there every man
active:  I met
novoice: seemed to me
active:  to be a policeman or a detective
noverb:  and,
noverb:  for all
active:  it was a cold night
active:  the sweat was pouring down my face
active:  I came to the Brixton Road
active:  My sister asked me
active:  was the matter
active:  I was so pale
active:  I told her
passive: I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel
active:  Then I went into the back yard
active:  smoked a pipe
novoice: wondered
active:  it would be best
active:  to do
noverb:  I had a friend once called Maudsley
active:  went to the bad
active:  has just been serving his time in Pentonville
noverb:  One day
active:  he had met me
noverb:  fell into talk about the ways of thieves
active:  they could get rid of
active:  they stole
active:  I knew
active:  he would be true
noverb:  to me
noverb:  for I knew one or two things about him
active:  I made up my mind
active:  to go right on to Kilburn
active:  he lived
active:  take him into my confidence
active:  He would show me
active:  to turn the stone into money
active:  to get to him in safety
active:  I thought of the agonies
active:  I had gone through
active:  coming from the hotel
active:  I might
passive: at any moment be seized and searched
active:  there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket
active:  I was leaning against the wall at the time
active:  looking at the geese
active:  were waddling about round my feet
active:  suddenly an idea came into my head
active:  showed me
active:  I could beat the best detective
active:  ever lived
noverb:  My sister had told me some weeks
active:  I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present
active:  I knew
active:  she was always
noverb:  her word
active:  I would take my goose now
noverb:  in it
active:  I would carry my stone to Kilburn
active:  There was a little shed in the yard
noverb:  behind this
active:  I drove one of the birds
noverb:  a fine big one
noverb:  white
noverb:  with a barred tail
active:  I caught it
active:  prying its bill open
active:  I thrust the stone down its throat
active:  my finger could reach
active:  The bird gave a gulp
active:  I felt the stone pass along its gullet
noverb:  down into its crop
novoice: the creature flapped and struggled
active:  came my sister
active:  to know
active:  was the matter
active:  As I turned
active:  to speak to her the brute broke loose
novoice: fluttered off among the others
active:  were you doing with
noverb:  bird
noverb:  Jem
active:  says she
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you said
noverb:  you'd give me one for Christmas

active:  you, Maggie,' says I
active:  it is all
noverb:  the same to you
active:  I'd rather have
noverb:  one
active:  I was handling just now
noverb:  The other is a good three pound heavier
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  we fattened it expressly for you
noverb:  Never mind
active:  I'll have the other
active:  I'll take it now
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  just as you
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  a little huffed
noverb:  is it you want
noverb:  That white one with the barred tail
noverb:  right in the middle of the flock
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  very well
noverb:  Kill it
noverb:  take it with you
noverb:  Well,
active:  I did
active:  she said
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn
active:  I told my pal
active:  I had done
noverb:  for
active:  he was a man
noverb:  that it was easy
active:  to tell a thing like
noverb:  to
active:  He laughed
active:  he choked
active:  we got a knife
active:  opened the goose
active:  My heart turned
active:  to water
active:  for there was no sign of the stone
active:  I knew
active:  some terrible mistake had occurred
active:  I left the bird
noverb:  rushed back to my sister's
novoice: hurried into the back yard
active:  There was not a bird
active:  to be seen there
active:  Where are they all
noverb:  Maggie
active:  I cried
active:  Gone to the dealer's
noverb:  Jem.
noverb:  dealer's?
noverb:  Breckinridge
noverb:  of Covent Garden
active:  was there another with a barred tail
active:  I asked
noverb:  the same
noverb:  the one
active:  I chose
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Jem
active:  there were two barred-tailed ones
active:  I could never tell them apart
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  of course I saw it all
active:  I ran off
active:  my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge
active:  he had sold the lot at once
noverb:  not one word would he tell me as to
active:  they had gone
noverb:  You heard him yourselves to-night
noverb:  Well,
active:  he has always answered me
noverb:  that
noverb:  My sister thinks
active:  I am going mad
active:  Sometimes I think
active:  I am myself
noverb:  And now
noverb:  now I am myself a branded thief
noverb:  without ever having touched the wealth for
active:  I sold my character
active:  God help me
active:  God help me
active:  He burst into convulsive sobbing
novoice: with his face buried in his hands
active:  There was a long silence
passive: broken only by his heavy breathing
noverb:  by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table
noverb:  my friend rose
noverb:  threw open the door
active:  Get out
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Oh
active:  Heaven bless you
noverb:  No
noverb:  words
active:  Get out
noverb:  And no
passive: words were needed
active:  There was a rush
noverb:  a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
noverb:  After all
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
passive: reaching up his hand for his clay pipe
passive: I am not retained by the police
active:  to supply their deficiencies
active:  If Horner were in danger
active:  it would be another thing
active:  this fellow will not appear against him
active:  the case must collapse
active:  I suppose
active:  I am commuting a felony
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that I am saving a soul
active:  This fellow will not go wrong again
passive: he is too terribly frightened
active:  Send him
active:  to gaol now
noverb:  you make him a gaol-bird for life
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is the season of forgiveness

active:  now come
active:  to light
noverb:  for I have reasons
active:  to know
active:  there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  tend to make the matter even more terrible
noverb:  than the truth

noverb:  in April in the year '83
active:  I woke one morning to find
active:  Sherlock Holmes standing
noverb:  fully dressed
noverb:  by the side of my bed

active:  as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me
noverb:  it was only a quarter-past seven
active:  I blinked up at him in some surprise
noverb:  perhaps just a little resentment

noverb:  entirely upon small points

noverb:  of all others
active:  I have a right
active:  to look for help and advice looks upon all

active:  be precise as to details
active:  said he
active:  It is easy
noverb:  for me
active:  to be
passive: for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory

active:  The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
active:  fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early
active:  we knew
active:  he had not retired
active:  to rest
passive: for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars
active:  it was his custom

noverb:  Certainly not
noverb:  during the last few nights
active:  I have always
noverb:  about three in the morning

active:  it has awakened me
active:  I cannot tell
active:  it came from
noverb:  perhaps from the next room
noverb:  perhaps from the lawn
active:  I thought
active:  I would just ask you
active:  you had heard it

noverb:  Ah
active:  I sleep more heavily

noverb:  Well,
active:  it is of no great consequence
noverb:  at any rate
active:  She smiled back at me
active:  closed my door
noverb:  a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock
noverb:  Indeed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Was it your custom always
active:  to lock yourselves in at night
noverb:  Always
noverb:  And
active:  I think
active:  I mentioned to
noverb:  you
active:  the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon
active:  We had no feeling of security
passive: our doors were locked
noverb:  Quite
active:  Pray
active:  proceed with your statement
active:  I could not sleep that night
active:  A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me
noverb:  My sister
noverb:  I
active:  you will recollect
active:  were twins
active:  you know
noverb:  subtle are the links
active:  bind two souls
active:  are
noverb:  closely allied
active:  It was a wild night
active:  The wind was howling
active:  the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  amid all the hubbub of the gale
active:  there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman
active:  I knew
active:  it was my sister's voice
active:  I sprang from my bed
active:  wrapped a shawl
active:  round me
novoice: rushed into the corridor
active:  As I opened my door
active:  I seemed to hear a low whistle
noverb:  such as my sister described
noverb:  a few moments later a clanging sound
noverb:  as
active:  a mass of metal had fallen
active:  As I ran down the passage
passive: my sister's door was unlocked
passive: revolved slowly upon its hinges
active:  I stared at it horror-stricken
active:  not knowing
active:  was about
active:  to issue from
noverb:  it
active:  By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister
active:  appear at the opening
novoice: her face blanched with terror
noverb:  her hands groping for help
noverb:  her whole figure swaying to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  of a drunkard
active:  I ran to her
active:  threw my arms
active:  round her
novoice: at that moment her knees seemed
active:  to give way
active:  she fell to the ground
active:  She writhed as one
active:  is in terrible pain
passive: her limbs were dreadfully convulsed
noverb:  At first I thought
active:  she had not recognised me
noverb:  as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice
active:  I shall never forget
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  my God
noverb:  Helen
active:  It was the band
noverb:  The speckled band
active:  There was something
noverb:  else
noverb:  she would fain have said
active:  she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room
active:  a fresh convulsion seized her
noverb:  choked her words
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  calling loudly for my stepfather
active:  I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown
active:  When he reached my sister's side
active:  she was unconscious
noverb:  ,
active:  he poured brandy down her throat
novoice: sent for medical aid from the village
active:  all efforts were in vain
noverb:  for she slowly sank and died
noverb:  having recovered her consciousness
active:  Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
noverb:  One moment
active:  said Holmes
active:  are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
active:  Could you swear to
noverb:  it
active:  That was
active:  the county coroner asked me at the inquiry
active:  It is my strong impression
noverb:  that I heard it
noverb:  among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house
passive: I may possibly have been deceived
noverb:  Was your sister dressed
noverb:  No
active:  she was in her night-dress
active:  In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match
noverb:  in her left a match-box
active:  Showing
active:  she had struck a light
novoice: looked about her
active:  the alarm took place
active:  That is important
noverb:  And
noverb:  conclusions did the coroner come to
active:  He investigated the case with great care
novoice: for Dr. Roylott's conduct had
active:  long been notorious in the county
active:  he was unable
active:  to find any satisfactory cause of death
active:  My evidence showed
passive: the door had been fastened upon the inner side
passive: the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
passive: were secured every night
passive: The walls were carefully sounded
passive: were shown
active:  to be quite solid all round
passive: the flooring was also thoroughly examined
noverb:  with the same result
active:  The chimney is wide
passive: is barred up by four large staples
active:  It is certain
noverb:  , therefore
active:  my sister was quite alone
noverb:  she met her end
noverb:  Besides
active:  there were no marks
noverb:  of any violence upon her
noverb:  about poison
active:  The doctors examined her for it
noverb:  without success
active:  do you think
active:  this unfortunate lady died of
active:  It is my belief
noverb:  that she died of pure fear
noverb:  nervous shock
active:  it was
noverb:  frightened her I cannot imagine
noverb:  Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
noverb:  Yes
active:  there are nearly always some
noverb:  there
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  did you gather from this allusion to a band
noverb:  a speckled band
active:  Sometimes I have thought
active:  it was merely the wild talk of delirium
noverb:  sometimes
active:  it may have referred to some band of people
noverb:  perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
active:  I do not know
noverb:  the spotted handkerchiefs
noverb:  so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective
active:  she used
active:  Holmes shook his head like a man
noverb:  who is far
noverb:  from being satisfied
noverb:  These are very deep waters
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  go on with your narrative
active:  Two years have passed
novoice: my life has been until lately lonelier
noverb:  A month ago
noverb:  however
noverb:  a dear friend
active:  I have known for many years
noverb:  has done me the honour
active:  to ask my hand in marriage
active:  His name is Armitage
noverb:  Percy Armitage
noverb:  the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading
active:  My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match
active:  we are to be married in the course of the spring
noverb:  Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building
passive: my bedroom wall has been pierced
active:  I have had
active:  to move into the chamber in
novoice: my sister died
active:  to sleep in the very bed in
active:  she slept
active:  Imagine
noverb:  my thrill of terror
noverb:  last night
noverb:  as I lay awake
noverb:  thinking over her terrible fate
novoice: I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle
active:  had been the herald of her own death
active:  I sprang up
active:  lit the lamp
active:  nothing was to be seen in the room
active:  I was too shaken
active:  to go
active:  to bed again
noverb:  however
active:  I dressed
active:  it was daylight
active:  I slipped down
active:  got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn
active:  is opposite
active:  drove to Leatherhead
noverb:  from whence I have come on this morning with the one object
active:  seeing you
active:  asking your advice
active:  You have done wisely
active:  said my friend
active:  have you told me all
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  all
noverb:  Miss Roylott
active:  you have not
active:  You are screening your stepfather
noverb:  do you mean
active:  For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace
active:  fringed the hand
active:  lay upon our visitor's knee
noverb:  Five little livid spots
noverb:  the marks of four fingers and a thumb
passive: were printed upon the white wrist
passive: You have been cruelly used
active:  said Holmes
active:  The lady coloured deeply
novoice: covered over her injured wrist
active:  He is a hard man
active:  she said
active:  and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
active:  There was a long silence
noverb:  during
active:  Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands
novoice: stared into the crackling fire
active:  This is a very deep business
active:  he said at last
active:  There are a thousand details
active:  I should desire to know
active:  I decide upon our course of action
active:  Yet we have not a moment
active:  to lose
active:  we were
active:  to come to Stoke Moran to-day
active:  would
active:  it be possible
noverb:  for us
active:  to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
active:  it happens
noverb:  he spoke
active:  coming into town to-day upon some most important business
active:  It is probable
noverb:  that he will be away all day
active:  there would be nothing
active:  to disturb you
active:  We have a housekeeper now
active:  she is old and foolish
active:  I could easily get her out of the way
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You are not averse
noverb:  to this trip, Watson
noverb:  By no means
active:  we shall
active:  come
active:  are you going to do yourself
active:  I have one or two things
active:  I would wish to do now
active:  I am in town
active:  But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train
active:  to be there in time for your coming
active:  And you may expect us early in the afternoon
noverb:  I have myself some small business matters
active:  to attend to
active:  Will you not wait and breakfast
noverb:  No
active:  I must go
passive: My heart is lightened already
active:  I have confided my trouble to you
noverb:  I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
active:  She dropped her thick black veil over her face
novoice: glided from the room
noverb:  And
noverb:  do you think of it all
noverb:  Watson
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  It seems to me
active:  to be a most dark and sinister business
noverb:  Dark enough
noverb:  sinister enough
noverb:  Yet
active:  the lady is correct
active:  saying
noverb:  the flooring
active:  walls are sound
active:  the door, window, and chimney are impassable
active:  her sister must have been undoubtedly alone
noverb:  she met her mysterious end
active:  becomes
noverb:  , of these nocturnal whistles,
noverb:  of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
active:  I cannot think
active:  When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
noverb:  the presence of a band of gipsies
active:  are on intimate terms with this old doctor
noverb:  the fact
active:  we have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  the doctor has an interest
active:  preventing his stepdaughter's marriage
noverb:  the dying allusion to a band
noverb:  finally
noverb:  the fact
novoice: Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang
passive: might have been caused by one of those metal bars
active:  secured the shutters falling back into its place
active:  I think
passive: there is good ground
active:  to think
passive: the mystery may be cleared along those lines
active:  did the gipsies
active:  do
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  I see many objections to any such theory
noverb:  And
active:  do
active:  I. It is precisely for
noverb:  reason
active:  we are going to Stoke Moran this day
active:  I want
active:  to see
active:  the objections are fatal
passive: they may be explained away
noverb:  in the name of the devil
passive: The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact
active:  our door had been suddenly dashed open
active:  a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
active:  His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional
noverb:  of the agricultural
active:  having a black top-hat
noverb:  , a long frock-coat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a pair of high gaiters
noverb:  with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand
noverb:  So tall was he
active:  his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway
active:  his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
noverb:  A large face
passive: seared with a thousand wrinkles
noverb:  burned yellow with the sun
novoice: marked with every evil passion
passive: was turned from one to the other of us
noverb:  his deep-set, bile-shot eyes
noverb:  his high
noverb:  thin
noverb:  fleshless nose
noverb:  gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
noverb:  of
active:  you is Holmes
active:  asked this apparition
noverb:  My name
noverb:  sir
active:  you have the advantage of me
active:  said my companion quietly
active:  I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  , of Stoke Moran
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said Holmes blandly
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  I will do nothing of the kind
active:  My stepdaughter has been here
active:  I have traced her
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  It is a little cold for the time of the year
active:  said Holmes
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  screamed the old man furiously
active:  I have heard
noverb:  the crocuses promise well
active:  continued my companion imperturbably
noverb:  Ha
active:  You put me off
active:  do you
active:  said
noverb:  our new visitor
active:  taking a step forward
active:  shaking his hunting-crop
active:  I know you
noverb:  you scoundrel
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you before
active:  You are Holmes, the meddler
active:  My friend smiled
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the busybody
active:  His smile broadened
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office
active:  Holmes chuckled heartily
active:  Your conversation is most entertaining
active:  said he
active:  When you go out close the door
active:  for there is a decided draught
active:  I will go
active:  I have said my say
noverb:  Don't you dare
active:  to meddle with my affairs
active:  I know
active:  Miss Stoner has been here
active:  I traced her
active:  I am a dangerous man
active:  to fall foul of
noverb:  See here
active:  He stepped swiftly forward
active:  seized the poker
active:  bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
active:  See
active:  you keep yourself out of my grip
active:  he snarled
active:  hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace
active:  he strode out of the room
active:  He seems a very amiable person
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I am not quite so bulky
active:  he had remained
active:  I might have shown him
active:  my grip was not much more feeble
noverb:  his own
active:  he spoke
active:  he picked up the steel poker
active:  , with a sudden effort, straightened it out again
noverb:  Fancy his having the insolence
active:  to confound me with the official detective force
noverb:  This incident gives zest to our investigation
noverb:  however
noverb:  I only trust
active:  our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence
active:  allowing this brute
active:  to trace her
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall order breakfast
active:  afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons
active:  I hope to get some data
active:  may help us in this matter
active:  It was nearly one
noverb:  o'clock
novoice: Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion
active:  He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper
noverb:  scrawled over with notes and figures
active:  I have seen the will of the deceased wife
active:  said he
active:  To determine its exact meaning
passive: I have been obliged
active:  to work out the present prices of the investments with
passive: it is concerned
noverb:  The total income
active:  at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100
active:  is now
noverb:  through the fall in agricultural prices
noverb:  not more than $750
active:  Each daughter can claim an income of $250
noverb:  in case of marriage
active:  It is evident
noverb:  , therefore
active:  both girls had married
active:  this beauty would have had a mere pittance
active:  even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
passive: My morning's work has not been wasted
active:  it has proved
active:  he has the very strongest motives
active:  standing in the way of anything of the sort
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  this is too serious for dawdling
noverb:  especially
active:  the old man is aware
active:  we are interesting ourselves in his affairs
active:  you are ready
noverb:  , we shall call a cab
noverb:  drive to Waterloo
active:  I should be very much obliged
active:  you would slip your revolver into your pocket
noverb:  An Eley's No
active:  2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
active:  can twist steel pokers into knots
active:  a tooth-brush are
active:  I think
noverb:  all
active:  we need
noverb:  At Waterloo
active:  we were fortunate
noverb:  in catching a train for Leatherhead
active:  we hired a trap at the station inn
active:  drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes
active:  It was a perfect day
noverb:  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
noverb:  The trees
active:  wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots
active:  the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
noverb:  To me at least
active:  there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon
passive: we were engaged
noverb:  My companion sat in the front of the trap
noverb:  his arms folded
active:  his hat pulled down over his eyes
active:  his chin sunk upon his breast
active:  buried in the deepest thought
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  he started
active:  tapped me on the shoulder
novoice: pointed over the meadows
noverb:  Look there
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
noverb:  thickening into a grove at the highest point
noverb:  From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
noverb:  high roof-tree of a very old mansion
noverb:  Stoke Moran
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  remarked the driver
active:  There is some building going on there
active:  said Holmes
active:  that is
active:  we are going
active:  There's the village
active:  said the driver
active:  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left
active:  you want
active:  to get to the house
active:  you'll find it shorter
active:  to get over this stile
noverb:  by the foot-path over the fields
noverb:  There
active:  it is
active:  the lady is walking
noverb:  And the lady
active:  I fancy
active:  is Miss Stoner
active:  observed Holmes
active:  shading his eyes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I think
active:  we had
active:  better do
active:  you suggest
active:  We got off
active:  paid our fare
active:  the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
active:  I thought it as well
active:  said Holmes
active:  we climbed the stile
active:  this fellow should think
active:  we had come here as architects
noverb:  on some definite business
active:  It may stop his gossip
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  You see
active:  we have been
noverb:  our word
active:  Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
noverb:  spoke her joy
active:  I have been waiting
noverb:  eagerly for you
active:  she cried
noverb:  shaking hands with us warmly
noverb:  All has turned out splendidly
active:  Dr. Roylott has gone to town
active:  it is unlikely
noverb:  that he will be back
noverb:  before evening
active:  We have had the pleasure
active:  making the doctor's acquaintance
active:  said Holmes
active:  in a few words he sketched out
active:  had occurred
active:  Miss Stoner turned white to the lips
active:  she listened
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  she cried
active:  he has followed me
active:  it appears
active:  He is so cunning
noverb:  that I never know
active:  I am safe
noverb:  from him
active:  will he say
active:  he returns
active:  He must guard himself
noverb:  for he may find
active:  there is someone
noverb:  more cunning
noverb:  himself upon his track
active:  You must lock yourself up from him to-night
active:  he is violent
noverb:  , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow
noverb:  Now,
active:  we must make the best use of our time
noverb:  kindly take us at once to the rooms
active:  we are
active:  to examine
active:  The building was of grey
noverb:  lichen-blotched stone
noverb:  with a high central portion
active:  two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side
passive: In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards
passive: the roof was partly caved in
noverb:  a picture of ruin

noverb:  of any workmen at the moment of our visit

noverb:  This
active:  I take it
active:  belongs to the room in
noverb:  you used
active:  to sleep
noverb:  the centre one to your sister's
noverb:  the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber
noverb:  Exactly
active:  But I am now sleeping in the middle one
active:  Pending the alterations
active:  I understand
noverb:  By the way
active:  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at
noverb:  end wall
active:  There were none
active:  I believe
active:  it was an excuse
active:  to move me from my room
noverb:  Ah!
active:  is suggestive
noverb:  Now,
active:  on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from
active:  these three rooms open
active:  There are windows
noverb:  in it
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  very small ones
noverb:  Too narrow for anyone
active:  to pass through
noverb:  As you
active:  locked your doors at night
active:  your rooms were unapproachable from
noverb:  side
noverb:  Now,
active:  would you have the kindness
active:  to go into your room
noverb:  bar your shutters
active:  Miss Stoner did
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  after a careful examination through the open window
active:  endeavoured in every way
active:  to force the shutter open
noverb:  without success
active:  There was no slit through
passive: a knife could be passed
active:  to raise the bar
noverb:  with his lens
active:  he tested the hinges
active:  they were of solid iron
active:  built firmly into the massive masonry
noverb:  Hum
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  scratching his chin in some perplexity
active:  my theory certainly presents some difficulties
active:  No one could pass these shutters
passive: they were bolted
noverb:  Well,
active:  we shall see
noverb:  the inside throws any light upon the matter
passive: A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from
active:  the three bedrooms opened
active:  Holmes refused
active:  to examine the third chamber
active:  we passed at once to the second
noverb:  in
active:  Miss Stoner was now sleeping
noverb:  in
active:  her sister had met with her fate
active:  It was a homely little room
noverb:  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace
noverb:  after the fashion of old country-houses
active:  A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner
noverb:  a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another
noverb:  a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window
active:  These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre
noverb:  The boards round
active:  the panelling of the walls were of brown
noverb:  worm-eaten oak
noverb:  old
active:  discoloured
active:  it may have dated from the original building of the house
active:  Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner
active:  sat silent
active:  his eyes travelled round
noverb:  round
noverb:  up and down
noverb:  taking in every detail of the apartment
active:  Where does
active:  bell communicate with
active:  he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope
active:  hung down beside the bed
active:  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
active:  It goes to the housekeeper's room
active:  It looks newer
noverb:  the other things
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  it was only put there a couple of years ago
novoice: Your sister asked for
noverb:  it
active:  I suppose
noverb:  No
active:  I never heard of her using it
active:  We used always to get
active:  we wanted for ourselves
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it seemed unnecessary
active:  to put
noverb:  nice a bell-pull there
active:  You will excuse me for a few minutes
active:  I satisfy myself as to this floor
active:  He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
active:  crawled swiftly backward and forward
active:  examining minutely the cracks between the boards
active:  he did the same with the wood-work with
passive: the chamber was panelled
active:  Finally he walked over to the bed
novoice: spent some time
active:  staring at
noverb:  it
active:  running his eye up and down the wall
active:  Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand
noverb:  gave it a brisk tug
active:  it's a dummy
active:  said he
noverb:  Won't
active:  it ring
noverb:  No
passive: it is not even attached to a wire
active:  This is very interesting
active:  You can see now
passive: it is fastened to a hook just above
active:  the little opening for the ventilator is
noverb:  very absurd
active:  I never noticed
noverb:  before
noverb:  Very strange
active:  muttered Holmes
noverb:  pulling at the rope
noverb:  There are one or two very singular points about this room
noverb:  For example
noverb:  a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
active:  , with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the
noverb:  air
active:  That is also quite modern
active:  said the lady
active:  Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  there were several little changes carried out about
noverb:  time
active:  They seem
novoice: to have been of a most interesting character
noverb:  dummy bell-ropes
noverb:  ventilators
active:  do not ventilate
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
active:  Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger
noverb:  of his step-daughter
active:  was as plainly furnished
noverb:  A camp-bed
noverb:  a small wooden shelf full of books
noverb:  , mostly of a technical character
noverb:  an armchair beside the bed
active:  a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron
active:  safe were the principal things
active:  met the eye
active:  Holmes walked slowly round
novoice: examined each
noverb:  all of them with the keenest interest
active:  What's in here
active:  he asked
active:  tapping the safe
noverb:  My stepfather's business papers
noverb:  Oh! you have seen inside
noverb:  Only once
noverb:  some years ago
active:  I remember
active:  it was full
noverb:  of papers
noverb:  There isn't a cat in it
noverb:  for example
noverb:  No
noverb:  a strange idea
noverb:  Well,
active:  look at this
active:  He took up a small saucer of milk
novoice: stood on the top of it
noverb:  No
noverb:  we don't keep a cat
active:  there is a cheetah and a baboon
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Well,
active:  a cheetah is just a big cat
active:  a saucer of milk does not go very far
active:  satisfying its wants
active:  I daresay
active:  There is one point
active:  I should wish
active:  to determine
active:  He squatted down in front of the wooden chair
active:  examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
active:  Thank you
active:  That is quite settled
active:  said he
active:  rising and putting his lens in his pocket
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Here is something interesting
noverb:  The object
active:  had caught
noverb:  his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
noverb:  The lash
noverb:  however
active:  was curled upon itself
noverb:  tied
active:  to make a loop of whipcord
noverb:  do you make of
noverb:  Watson
active:  It's a common enough lash
noverb:  But I don't know
passive: it should be tied
active:  That is not quite
noverb:  common
active:  is it
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  me! it's a wicked world
active:  a clever man turns his brains
active:  to crime
active:  it is the worst of all
active:  I think
active:  I have seen enough now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
noverb:  with your permission
active:  we shall walk out upon the lawn
active:  I had never seen my friend's face so grim
noverb:  his brow
noverb:  dark
active:  it was
active:  we turned from the scene of this investigation
active:  We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking
active:  to break in upon his thoughts
active:  he roused himself from his reverie
active:  It is very essential
noverb:  , Miss Stoner
active:  said he
active:  you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
active:  I shall most certainly do
active:  The matter is too serious for any hesitation
active:  Your life may depend upon your compliance
active:  I assure you
active:  I am in your hands
noverb:  In the first place
noverb:  my friend
active:  I must spend the night in your room
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  I gazed at him in astonishment
noverb:  Yes
active:  it must be
noverb:  Let me explain
active:  I believe
active:  is the village inn over there
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is the Crown
noverb:  Very good
active:  Your windows would be visible from there
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
active:  your stepfather comes back
noverb:  you hear him retire for the night
active:  you must open the shutters of your window
active:  undo the hasp
noverb:  put your lamp there as a signal to us
active:  withdraw quietly with everything
active:  you are likely
active:  to want into the room
active:  you used
active:  to occupy
active:  I have no doubt
active:  , in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  easily
noverb:  The rest
active:  you will leave in our hands
active:  will
active:  you do
active:  We shall spend the night in your room
active:  we shall investigate the cause of this noise
active:  has disturbed you
active:  I believe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have already made up your mind
active:  said Miss Stoner
active:  laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
active:  Perhaps I have
active:  , for pity's sake, tell me
active:  was the cause of my sister's death
active:  I should prefer to have clearer proofs
active:  I speak
active:  You can at least tell me
active:  my own thought is correct
active:  she died from some sudden fright
noverb:  No
active:  I do not think
active:  I think
active:  there was probably some
noverb:  more tangible cause
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we must leave you for
novoice: Dr. Roylott returned and saw us
active:  our journey would be in vain
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  be brave
noverb:  for
active:  you will do
active:  I have told you
active:  you may rest assured
noverb:  we shall soon drive away the dangers
active:  threaten you
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  engaging a bedroom
noverb:  sitting-room at the Crown Inn
active:  They were on the upper floor
noverb:  from our window
active:  we could command a view of the avenue gate
noverb:  of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House
active:  At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  drive past
active:  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad
active:  drove him
active:  The boy had some slight difficulty
active:  undoing the heavy iron gates
active:  we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice
active:  saw the fury with
active:  he shook his clinched fists at him
active:  The trap drove on
noverb:  a few minutes later we saw a sudden light
active:  spring up among the trees
passive: the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness
active:  I have really some scruples as
active:  to taking you to-night
active:  There is a distinct element of danger
active:  Can I be of assistance
active:  Your presence might be invaluable
active:  I shall certainly come
active:  It is very kind
noverb:  of you
active:  You speak of danger
active:  You have evidently seen more in these rooms
active:  was visible to me
noverb:  No
active:  I fancy
active:  I may have deduced a little
active:  I imagine
active:  you saw all
active:  I did
noverb:  I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope
noverb:  purpose
active:  could answer
active:  I confess
active:  is more than
active:  I can imagine
active:  You saw the ventilator
noverb:  too
noverb:  Yes
active:  I do not think
active:  it is such
noverb:  a very unusual thing
active:  to have a small
active:  opening between two rooms
active:  It was so small
noverb:  that a rat could hardly pass through
active:  I knew
active:  we should find a ventilator
active:  we came to Stoke Moran
noverb:  My dear Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I did
active:  You remember in her statement
active:  she said
active:  her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  of course
active:  suggested at once
active:  there must be a communication
noverb:  between the two rooms
noverb:  It could only be a small one
passive: it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
active:  I deduced a ventilator
noverb:  harm can there be in that
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
passive: A ventilator is made
passive: a cord is hung
noverb:  a lady
noverb:  sleeps in the bed dies
active:  Does not
active:  strike you
active:  I cannot as yet see any connection
active:  Did you observe anything very peculiar
noverb:  about
noverb:  bed
noverb:  No
passive: It was clamped to the floor
active:  Did you
noverb:  see a bed fastened like
noverb:  before
active:  I cannot say
active:  I have
noverb:  The lady could not move her bed
active:  It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator
noverb:  to the rope
active:  we may call it
passive: it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  I seem
active:  to see dimly
active:  you are hinting at
active:  We are only just in time
active:  to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
noverb:  Subtle enough and horrible enough
active:  When a doctor does go wrong
active:  he is the first of criminals
active:  He has nerve
active:  he has knowledge
noverb:  Palmer
active:  Pritchard were among the heads of their profession
noverb:  This man strikes even deeper
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall be able
active:  to strike deeper still
active:  we shall have horrors enough
active:  the night is over
noverb:  for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe
noverb:  turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
noverb:  About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
noverb:  all was dark in the direction of the Manor House
active:  Two hours passed slowly away
noverb:  suddenly
noverb:  just at the stroke of eleven
active:  a single bright light shone out right in front of us
active:  That is our signal
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  springing to his feet
active:  it comes from the middle window
active:  we passed out
active:  he exchanged a few words with the landlord
active:  explaining
active:  we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that we might spend the night there
noverb:  A moment later
active:  we were out on the dark road
noverb:  a chill wind blowing in our faces
noverb:  one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom
active:  to guide us on our sombre errand
active:  There was little difficulty
active:  entering the grounds
noverb:  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
noverb:  Making our way among the trees
active:  we reached the lawn
active:  crossed it
active:  were about
active:  to enter through the window
noverb:  out from a clump of laurel bushes there
novoice: darted
novoice: seemed
active:  to be a hideous
noverb:  distorted child
active:  threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs
active:  ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
noverb:  My God
active:  I whispered
active:  did you see it
active:  Holmes was for the moment
active:  I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
active:  he broke into a low laugh
novoice: put his lips to my ear
active:  It is a nice household
active:  he murmured
active:  That is the baboon
active:  I had forgotten the strange pets
active:  the doctor affected
active:  There was a cheetah
noverb:  too
active:  perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
active:  I confess
active:  I felt easier in my mind
noverb:  after following Holmes' example
active:  slipping off my shoes
active:  I found myself inside the bedroom
active:  My companion noiselessly closed the shutters
active:  moved the lamp onto the table
noverb:  cast his eyes round the room
noverb:  All was
active:  we had seen it in the daytime
active:  creeping up to me
active:  making a trumpet of his hand
active:  he whispered into my ear again
noverb:  gently
active:  it was all
noverb:  that I could do to distinguish the words
active:  The least sound would be fatal to our plans
active:  I nodded to show
active:  I had heard
active:  We must sit without light
active:  He would see it through the ventilator
active:  I nodded again
active:  Do not go asleep
active:  your very life may depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  Have your pistol
active:  ready in case
active:  we should need it
active:  I will sit on the side of the bed
noverb:  you in
noverb:  chair
active:  I took out my revolver
active:  laid it on the corner of the table
active:  Holmes had brought up a long thin cane
noverb:  this
active:  he placed upon the bed beside him
active:  By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
active:  he turned down the lamp
passive: we were left in darkness
active:  shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil
active:  I could not hear a sound
noverb:  not even the drawing of a breath
active:  I knew
noverb:  my companion sat open-eyed
noverb:  within a few feet of me
noverb:  in the same state of nervous tension in
active:  I was myself
active:  The shutters cut off the least ray of light
active:  we waited in absolute darkness
noverb:  From
active:  came the occasional cry of a night-bird
noverb:  once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
active:  told us
active:  the cheetah was indeed at liberty
noverb:  Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock
active:  boomed out every quarter of an hour
noverb:  long they seemed
noverb:  those quarters
active:  Twelve struck
noverb:  one
noverb:  two
noverb:  three
active:  still we sat waiting silently for
active:  might befall
noverb:  Suddenly
active:  there was the momentary gleam
noverb:  of a light up in the direction of the ventilator
passive: vanished immediately
passive: was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil
noverb:  heated metal
active:  Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern
active:  I heard a gentle sound of movement
noverb:  all was silent once
active:  the smell grew stronger
noverb:  For half an hour
active:  I sat with straining ears
active:  suddenly another sound became audible
noverb:  a very gentle
noverb:  soothing sound
noverb:  like
active:  of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
noverb:  The instant
active:  we heard it
active:  Holmes sprang from the bed
active:  struck a match
novoice: lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
active:  You see it, Watson
active:  he yelled
active:  You see it
active:  I saw nothing
active:  At the moment when Holmes struck the light
active:  I heard a low
noverb:  clear whistle
active:  the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me
active:  to tell
active:  it was at
novoice: my friend lashed
noverb:  savagely
active:  I could
noverb:  however
noverb:  see
active:  his face was deadly pale
novoice: filled with horror and loathing
active:  He had ceased
active:  to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator
active:  suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to
active:  I have ever listened
active:  It swelled up louder
noverb:  louder
noverb:  a hoarse yell of pain
noverb:  fear
noverb:  anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
active:  They say
noverb:  away down in the village
noverb:  even in the distant parsonage
active:  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
active:  It struck cold to our hearts
active:  I stood
active:  gazing at Holmes
noverb:  he at me
active:  until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from
active:  it rose
active:  can it mean
active:  I gasped
active:  It means
active:  it is all
noverb:  over
active:  Holmes answered
active:  And perhaps, after all, it is for the best
noverb:  Take your pistol
active:  we will enter Dr. Roylott's room
active:  With a grave face he lit the lamp
active:  led the way down the corridor
active:  Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
active:  he turned the handle
active:  entered
noverb:  I at his heels
noverb:  with the cocked pistol in my hand
active:  It was a singular sight
active:  met our eyes
active:  On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open
active:  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe
noverb:  the door of
active:  was ajar
active:  Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  clad in a long grey dressing-gown
active:  his bare ankles protruding beneath
active:  his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers
active:  Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash
active:  we had noticed during the day
passive: His chin was cocked upward
passive: his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
noverb:  Round his brow
active:  he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles,
active:  seemed to be bound tightly round his head
active:  we entered
active:  he made
noverb:  sound
noverb:  motion
noverb:  The band! the speckled band
noverb:  whispered Holmes
active:  I took a step forward
active:  In an instant his strange headgear began
active:  to move
active:  there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head
noverb:  puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
active:  It is a swamp adder
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  the deadliest snake in India
active:  He has died within ten seconds
passive: being bitten
active:  Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent
noverb:  the schemer falls into the pit
active:  he digs for another
noverb:  Let us thrust this creature back into its den
active:  we can
noverb:  remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter
noverb:  let the county police know
active:  has happened
active:  he spoke
active:  he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
noverb:  throwing the noose round the reptile's neck
active:  he drew it from its horrid perch
active:  carrying it at arm's length
active:  threw it into the iron safe
active:  he closed upon
noverb:  it
active:  Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  of Stoke Moran
active:  It is not necessary
noverb:  that I should prolong a narrative
active:  has already run to too great a length
active:  telling
active:  we broke the sad news to the terrified girl
active:  we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow
noverb:  of
active:  the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
novoice: the doctor met his fate
active:  indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
noverb:  The little
active:  I had yet
active:  to learn
active:  of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
active:  I had
active:  said he
active:  come to an entirely erroneous conclusion
noverb:  shows
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  dangerous it always is
active:  to reason from insufficient data
noverb:  The presence of the gipsies
noverb:  the use of the word 'band
passive: was used by the poor girl, no doubt,
active:  to explain the appearance
active:  she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match
active:  were sufficient
active:  to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
active:  I can only claim the merit
noverb:  I
active:  reconsidered my position
noverb:  however
active:  it became clear to me
active:  danger threatened an occupant of the room
active:  could not come
noverb:  from the window or the door
passive: My attention was speedily drawn
active:  I have already remarked to
noverb:  you, to this ventilator,
noverb:  to the bell-rope
active:  hung down to the bed
noverb:  The discovery
active:  this was a dummy
passive: the bed was clamped to the floor
active:  gave rise to the suspicion
active:  the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole
noverb:  coming to the bed
noverb:  The idea of a snake
novoice: occurred to me
active:  I coupled it with my knowledge
passive: the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India
active:  I felt
active:  I was probably on the right track
noverb:  The idea
active:  using a form of poison
passive: could not possibly be discovered
active:  by any chemical test was just such a one
active:  would occur to a clever and ruthless man
active:  had had an Eastern training
noverb:  The rapidity with
active:  such a poison would take effect
noverb:  would also, from his point of view, be an advantage
active:  It would be a sharp-eyed coroner
noverb:  indeed
active:  could distinguish the two little dark punctures
active:  would show
active:  the poison fangs had done their work
noverb:  Then I thought of the whistle
noverb:  Of course he must recall the snake
active:  the morning light revealed it to the victim
active:  He had trained it
noverb:  probably by the use of the milk
active:  we saw
active:  to return to him
novoice: summoned
active:  He would put it through this ventilator at the hour
active:  he thought best
noverb:  with the certainty
active:  it would crawl down the rope
noverb:  land on the bed
active:  It might or might not bite the occupant
active:  perhaps she might escape every night for a week
noverb:  sooner
noverb:  later she must fall a victim
active:  I had come to these conclusions
active:  I had entered his room
active:  An inspection of his chair showed me
active:  he had been in the habit
active:  standing on
noverb:  it
noverb:  of course would be necessary in order
active:  he should reach the ventilator
noverb:  The sight of the safe
noverb:  the saucer of milk
active:  the loop of whipcord were enough
active:  to finally dispel any doubts
active:  may have remained
active:  The metallic clang heard
passive: by Miss Stoner was obviously caused
active:  by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
active:  Having once made up my mind
active:  you know the steps
active:  I took in order
active:  to put the matter to the proof
active:  I heard the creature hiss
active:  I have no doubt
active:  you did also
noverb:  I
active:  lit the light
active:  attacked it
noverb:  With the result
active:  driving it through the ventilator
noverb:  And also with the result
active:  causing it
active:  to turn upon its master at the other side
active:  Some of the blows of my cane came home
active:  roused its snakish temper
active:  it flew upon the first person
active:  it saw
noverb:  In this way
active:  I am no doubt
noverb:  indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death
active:  I cannot say
active:  it is likely
active:  to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
noverb:  IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
noverb:  Of all the problems
passive: have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy
active:  there were only two
noverb:  which I was the means
noverb:  of introducing to his notice
noverb:  of Mr. Hatherley's thumb
noverb:  of Colonel Warburton's madness
active:  Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer
active:  the other was so strange in its inception
noverb:  so dramatic in its details
active:  it may be the
noverb:  more worthy
passive: being placed upon record
noverb:  even
noverb:  it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods
active:  reasoning by
active:  he achieved such remarkable results
active:  The story has
active:  I believe
passive: been told more than once in the newspapers
active:  , like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking
noverb:  set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print
active:  the facts slowly evolve
noverb:  your own eyes
noverb:  the mystery clears gradually away
active:  each new discovery furnishes a step
active:  leads on to the complete truth
active:  At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me
active:  the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
active:  It was in the summer of '89
active:  not long after my marriage
active:  the events occurred
active:  I am now about
active:  to summarise
active:  I had returned to civil practice
active:  had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
active:  I continually visited him
active:  occasionally even persuaded him
active:  to forgo his Bohemian habits
active:  to come and visit us
active:  My practice had steadily increased
active:  I happened
active:  to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station
active:  I got a few patients from among the officials
noverb:  One of these
active:  I had cured of a painful
noverb:  lingering disease

active:  advertising my virtues
active:  endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over

noverb:  One morning
noverb:  at a little
noverb:  seven o'clock
passive: I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door
active:  to announce
active:  two men had come from Paddington
active:  were waiting in the consulting-room
active:  I dressed hurriedly
noverb:  for I knew by experience
active:  railway cases were seldom trivial
novoice: hastened downstairs
active:  As I descended
noverb:  my old ally
noverb:  the guard
active:  came out of the room
active:  closed the door tightly behind him
noverb:  I've got him here
active:  he whispered
active:  jerking his thumb over his shoulder
active:  he's all right
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  for his manner suggested
active:  it was some strange creature
noverb:  which he had caged up in my room
active:  It's a new patient
active:  he whispered
active:  I thought
noverb:  I'd bring him round myself
noverb:  he couldn't slip away
noverb:  There
active:  he is
noverb:  all safe
noverb:  sound
active:  I must go now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I have my dooties
noverb:  just the same as you
noverb:  And off he went
noverb:  this trusty tout
noverb:  without even giving me time
active:  to thank him
active:  I entered my consulting-room
novoice: found
active:  a gentleman seated by the table
passive: He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
active:  he had laid down upon my books
active:  Round one of his hands
noverb:  he had a handkerchief wrapped
passive: was mottled all over with bloodstains
active:  He was young
noverb:  , not more than five-and-twenty
active:  I should say
noverb:  with a strong, masculine face
active:  he was exceedingly pale
noverb:  and gave me the impression of a man
active:  was suffering from some strong agitation
active:  it took all his strength of mind
active:  to control
active:  I am sorry
active:  to knock you up
noverb:  early
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said he
active:  I have had a very serious accident during the night
active:  I came in by train this morning
active:  inquiring at Paddington as to
active:  I might find a doctor
noverb:  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
noverb:  I gave the maid a card
active:  I see
active:  she has left it upon the side-table
active:  I took it up
active:  glanced at
noverb:  it
noverb:  Mr. Victor Hatherley
noverb:  hydraulic engineer
noverb:  16A
noverb:  Victoria Street (3rd floor)
active:  That was the name, style
noverb:  abode of my morning visitor
active:  I regret
noverb:  I have kept you waiting
active:  said I
active:  sitting down in my library-chair
active:  You are fresh
noverb:  from a night journey
active:  I understand
active:  is in itself a monotonous occupation
noverb:  Oh
active:  my night could not be called monotonous
active:  said he
novoice: laughed
active:  He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair
active:  shaking his sides
active:  All my medical instincts rose up against
noverb:  laugh
noverb:  Stop it
active:  I cried
active:  pull yourself together
active:  and I poured out some water from a caraffe
active:  It was useless
noverb:  , however
active:  He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts
active:  come upon a strong nature
active:  some great crisis is over
noverb:  gone
active:  Presently he came to himself once
noverb:  very weary
noverb:  pale-looking
active:  I have been making a fool of myself
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Not at all
active:  Drink this
active:  I dashed some brandy into the water
active:  the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
active:  That's better
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb
noverb:  rather to the place
passive: my thumb used
active:  to be
active:  He unwound the handkerchief
active:  held out his hand
noverb:  It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder
active:  to look at it
active:  There were four protruding fingers
noverb:  a horrid red, spongy surface
active:  the thumb should
passive: have been
passive: It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  this is a terrible injury
active:  It must have bled considerably
noverb:  Yes
active:  it did
active:  I fainted
passive: it was done
active:  I think
active:  I must have been senseless for a long time
active:  When I came to
noverb:  I found
active:  it was still bleeding
active:  I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist
active:  braced it up with a twig
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You should have been a surgeon
active:  It is a question of hydraulics
noverb:  you see
active:  came within my own province
passive: This has been done
active:  said I
active:  examining the wound
noverb:  by a very heavy and sharp instrument
noverb:  A thing
noverb:  a cleaver
active:  said he
noverb:  An accident
active:  I presume
noverb:  By no means
noverb:  ! a murderous attack
noverb:  Very murderous indeed
active:  You horrify me
active:  I sponged the wound
active:  cleaned it
active:  dressed it
active:  finally covered it over with cotton wadding
noverb:  carbolised bandages
active:  He lay back
active:  wincing
active:  he bit his lip from time to time
active:  is that
active:  I asked
active:  I had finished
noverb:  Capital
active:  Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man
active:  I was very weak
active:  I have had a good deal
active:  to go through
active:  Perhaps you had better not
active:  speak of the matter
active:  It is evidently trying to your nerves
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  not now
active:  I shall have to tell my tale to the police
noverb:  between ourselves
active:  it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine
passive: I should be surprised
active:  they believed my statement
noverb:  for it is a very extraordinary one
active:  I have not much in the way of proof with
active:  to back it up
noverb:  and,
noverb:  even
active:  they believe me
noverb:  the clues
active:  I can give
active:  them are so vague
noverb:  that it is a question
noverb:  whether justice will be done
noverb:  Ha
active:  cried I
active:  it is anything
noverb:  in the nature of a problem
noverb:  you desire
active:  to see solved
active:  I should strongly recommend you
active:  to come to my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  you go to the official police
noverb:  Oh
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  fellow
active:  answered my visitor
active:  and I should be very glad
active:  he would take the matter up
noverb:  of course I must use the official police as well
noverb:  Would you give me an introduction to him
active:  I'll do better
noverb:  I'll take you round to him myself
passive: I should be immensely obliged to
noverb:  you
active:  We'll call a cab
active:  go together
active:  We shall just be in time
active:  to have a little breakfast with him
active:  Do you feel equal to it
noverb:  Yes
active:  I shall not feel easy
active:  I have told my story
active:  my servant will call a cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in an instant
active:  I rushed upstairs
active:  explained the matter shortly to my wife
active:  in five minutes was inside a hansom
noverb:  driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes was
noverb:  as I expected
noverb:  lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown
active:  reading the agony column of The Times
active:  smoking his before-breakfast pipe
passive: was composed
novoice: of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before
noverb:  all carefully dried
novoice: collected on the corner of the mantelpiece
active:  He received us in his quietly genial fashion
active:  ordered fresh rashers
noverb:  eggs
active:  joined us in a hearty meal
passive: When it was concluded
active:  he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa
active:  placed a pillow beneath his head
active:  laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
active:  It is easy
active:  to see
noverb:  your experience has been no common one
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said he
active:  Pray
active:  lie down there
active:  make yourself absolutely at home
active:  Tell us
active:  you can
noverb:  stop
passive: you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
active:  Thank you
active:  said my patient
active:  I have felt another man
active:  the doctor bandaged me
active:  I think
active:  your breakfast has completed the cure
active:  I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible
active:  I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
active:  Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
active:  veiled his keen and eager nature
active:  I sat opposite to him
active:  we listened in silence to the strange story
active:  our visitor detailed to us
active:  You must know
active:  said he
active:  I am an orphan and a bachelor
active:  residing alone in lodgings in London
noverb:  By profession
active:  I am a hydraulic engineer
active:  I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years
passive: I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich
noverb:  Two years ago
active:  having served my time
active:  having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death
active:  I determined
active:  to start in business for myself
active:  took professional chambers in Victoria Street
active:  I suppose
active:  everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
active:  To me it has been exceptionally
active:  During two years I have had three consultations
noverb:  one small job
active:  is absolutely all
active:  my profession has brought me
active:  My gross takings amount to $27 10s
noverb:  Every day
noverb:  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon
active:  I waited in my little den
noverb:  until at last my heart began
active:  to sink
active:  I came to believe
active:  I should never have any practice at all
noverb:  Yesterday,
noverb:  however
noverb:  just
active:  I was thinking
active:  leaving the office
novoice: my clerk entered
active:  to say
active:  there was a gentleman
active:  waiting
active:  wished to see me upon business
active:  He brought up a card
noverb:  too
noverb:  with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Close at his heels came the colonel himself
noverb:  a man rather over the middle size
noverb:  of an exceeding thinness
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  thin a man
noverb:  His whole face sharpened away into nose
noverb:  chin
active:  the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
active:  Yet this emaciation seemed
noverb:  to be his natural habit
noverb:  due to no disease
active:  for his eye was bright
noverb:  his step brisk
noverb:  his bearing assured
active:  He was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed
noverb:  his age
active:  I should judge
active:  would be nearer forty
noverb:  thirty
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  with something of a German accent
passive: You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,
active:  being a man
noverb:  who is not only proficient
noverb:  in his profession
active:  is also discreet and capable
active:  preserving a secret
active:  I bowed
noverb:  feeling
active:  any young man would at such an address
active:  May I ask
active:  it was
active:  gave me
noverb:  good a character
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it is better
noverb:  that I should not tell you
noverb:  just at this moment
active:  I have it from the same source
active:  you are
noverb:  an orphan
noverb:  a bachelor
active:  are residing alone in London
active:  That is quite correct
active:  I answered
active:  you will excuse me
active:  I say
active:  I cannot see
noverb:  all this bears upon my professional qualifications
active:  I understand
active:  it was on a professional matter
active:  you wished
active:  to speak to me
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  you will find
noverb:  all I say
active:  is really to the point
active:  I have a professional commission for you
active:  absolute secrecy is quite essential
noverb:  absolute secrecy
active:  you understand
noverb:  of course we may expect
noverb:  from a man
active:  is alone
noverb:  from one
noverb:  lives in the bosom of his family
active:  I promise to keep a secret
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you may absolutely depend upon my doing
active:  He looked very hard at me as I spoke
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  I had never seen so suspicious
active:  questioning an eye
noverb:  Do you promise
active:  said
noverb:  he at last
noverb:  Yes
active:  I promise
noverb:  Absolute
noverb:  complete silence before
noverb:  during
noverb:  after
noverb:  No reference to the matter at all
noverb:  in word or writing
noverb:  I have already given you my word
noverb:  Very good
active:  He suddenly sprang up
noverb:  darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door
noverb:  The passage
active:  was empty
active:  That's all right
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  coming back
active:  I know
active:  clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs
active:  Now we can talk in safety
active:  He drew up his chair very close
noverb:  to mine
active:  began
active:  to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
noverb:  A feeling of repulsion
noverb:  of something akin
active:  to fear
active:  had begun
active:  to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
noverb:  Even my dread
active:  losing a client
active:  could not restrain me
active:  showing my impatience
active:  I beg
active:  you will state your business, sir,
active:  said I
active:  my time is of value
active:  Heaven forgive me for that last sentence
active:  the words came to my lips
noverb:  would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you
active:  he asked
noverb:  Most admirably
active:  I say a night's work
noverb:  an hour's would be nearer the mark
active:  I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine
active:  has got out of gear
active:  you show us
active:  is wrong
active:  we shall soon set
active:  it right ourselves
noverb:  do you think of such a commission as that
active:  The work appears to be light
noverb:  the pay munificent
noverb:  Precisely
active:  We shall want you
active:  to come to-night by the last train
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  To Eyford
noverb:  in Berkshire
active:  It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire
noverb:  within seven miles of Reading
active:  There is a train
noverb:  from Paddington
noverb:  would bring you there at about 11
noverb:  15
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall come down in a carriage
active:  to meet you
active:  There is a drive
noverb:  Yes
active:  our little place is quite out in the country
noverb:  It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
active:  we can hardly get there
noverb:  midnight
active:  I suppose
active:  there would be no chance of a train back
passive: I should be compelled
active:  to stop the night
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  we could easily give you a shake-down
active:  That is very awkward
active:  Could I not come at some more convenient hour
active:  We have judged it best
active:  you should come late
active:  It is to recompense you for any inconvenience
active:  we are paying to
noverb:  you
noverb:  a young and unknown man
noverb:  a fee
active:  would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  you would like
active:  to draw out of the business
active:  there is plenty of time
active:  to do
active:  I thought of the fifty guineas
noverb:  of
noverb:  very useful they would be to me
noverb:  Not at all
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I shall be very happy
active:  to accommodate myself to your wishes
active:  I should like
noverb:  however
active:  to understand a little more clearly
active:  it is
active:  you wish me
active:  to do
noverb:  Quite
active:  It is very natural
noverb:  that the pledge of secrecy
active:  we have exacted from
active:  you should have aroused your curiosity
active:  I have no wish
active:  to commit you to anything without your having it all laid
noverb:  you
active:  I suppose
active:  we are absolutely safe
noverb:  from eavesdroppers
noverb:  Entirely
noverb:  the matter stands
active:  You are probably aware
noverb:  that fuller's-earth is a valuable product
passive: it is only found in one or two places in England
active:  I have heard
noverb:  Some little time ago
active:  I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading
active:  I was fortunate enough
active:  to discover
active:  there was a deposit
noverb:  of fuller's-earth in one of my fields
active:  examining it
noverb:  however
active:  I found
active:  this deposit was a comparatively small one
noverb:  it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
noverb:  left
noverb:  of them
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the grounds of my neighbours
active:  These good people were absolutely ignorant
active:  their land contained
active:  was quite
noverb:  a gold-mine
noverb:  Naturally,
active:  it was to my interest
active:  to buy their land
active:  they discovered its true value
active:  unfortunately I had no capital by
active:  I could do this
active:  I took a few of my friends into the secret
noverb:  however
active:  they suggested
active:  we should quietly
noverb:  secretly work our own little deposit
noverb:  in this way
active:  we should earn the money
active:  would enable us
active:  to buy the neighbouring fields
noverb:  This
active:  we have
active:  now been doing for some time
noverb:  in order
active:  to help us in our operations
active:  we erected a hydraulic press
noverb:  This press
active:  I have already explained
active:  has got out of order
active:  we wish your advice upon the subject
active:  We guard our secret very jealously
noverb:  however
active:  it once became known
active:  we had hydraulic engineers
active:  coming to our little house
active:  it would soon rouse inquiry
active:  the facts came out
active:  it would be good-bye
noverb:  to any chance
active:  getting these fields
active:  carrying out our plans
active:  That is
active:  I have made
active:  you promise me
active:  you will not tell a human being
active:  you are going to Eyford to-night
active:  I hope
active:  I make it all plain
noverb:  I quite follow you
active:  said I. 'The only point
active:  I could not quite understand
active:  was
active:  use
active:  you could make of a hydraulic press
active:  excavating fuller's-earth
active:  I understand
passive: is dug out
noverb:  gravel from a pit
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he carelessly
active:  we have our own process
active:  We compress the earth into bricks
active:  to remove them
active:  revealing
active:  they are
active:  is a mere detail
active:  I have taken you fully into my confidence now
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  I have shown you
active:  I trust you
active:  He rose as
active:  he spoke
active:  I shall expect you
noverb:  at Eyford at 11
noverb:  15
active:  I shall certainly be there
noverb:  And not a word to a soul
active:  He looked at me with a last long
noverb:  questioning gaze
active:  pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp
active:  he hurried from the room
noverb:  Well,
active:  I came to think it all over in cool blood
active:  I was very much astonished
noverb:  as you may
noverb:  think
noverb:  at this sudden commission
passive: had been intrusted to me
noverb:  On the one hand, of course,
active:  I was glad
noverb:  , for the fee was at least tenfold
active:  I should have asked
passive: had
active:  I set a price upon my own services
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that this order might lead to other ones
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me
active:  I could not think
noverb:  his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient
active:  to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight
noverb:  his extreme anxiety
active:  I should tell anyone of my errand
noverb:  However,
active:  I threw all fears to the winds
active:  ate a hearty supper
active:  drove to Paddington
novoice: started off
active:  having obeyed to the letter the injunction as
active:  to holding my tongue
active:  At Reading I had to change not only my carriage
noverb:  my station
noverb:  However,
active:  I was in time for the last train to Eyford
active:  I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock
active:  I was the only passenger
noverb:  who got out there
active:  there was no one
noverb:  upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
novoice: As I passed out through the wicket gate
noverb:  however
active:  I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
active:  Without a word he grasped my arm
active:  hurried me into a carriage
noverb:  the door of
active:  was standing open
active:  He drew up the windows on
noverb:  side
passive: tapped on the wood-work
noverb:  away we went
active:  the horse could go
noverb:  One horse
active:  interjected Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only one
active:  Did you observe the colour
noverb:  Yes
active:  I saw it by the side-lights
active:  I was stepping into the carriage
active:  It was a chestnut
noverb:  Tired-looking
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  glossy
active:  Thank you
active:  I am sorry
active:  to have interrupted you
active:  Pray
active:  continue your most interesting statement
noverb:  Away we went
active:  we drove for at least an hour
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark had said
active:  it was only seven miles
active:  I should think
noverb:  from the rate
active:  we seemed to go
noverb:  from the time
active:  we took
active:  it must have been nearer twelve
active:  He sat at my side in silence all the time
active:  I was aware
noverb:  , more than once
active:  I glanced in his direction
active:  he was looking at me with great intensity
active:  The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world
noverb:  for we lurched and jolted terribly
active:  I tried
active:  to look out of the windows
active:  to see something of
active:  we were
passive: they were made of frosted glass
noverb:  I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
noverb:  Now
active:  I hazarded some remark
active:  to break the monotony of the journey
novoice: the colonel answered only in monosyllables
active:  the conversation soon flagged
noverb:  At last
noverb:  however
passive: the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
active:  the carriage came to a stand
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out
active:  I followed after him
active:  pulled me swiftly into a porch
active:  gaped in front of us
active:  We stepped
active:  it were
noverb:  right out of the carriage
noverb:  into the hall
active:  I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
noverb:  The instant
active:  I had crossed the threshold
novoice: the door slammed heavily behind us
active:  I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels
active:  the carriage drove away
active:  It was pitch dark inside the house
novoice: the colonel fumbled
active:  looking for matches
active:  muttering under his breath
active:  Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage
active:  a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction
active:  It grew broader
novoice: a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand
active:  she held above her head
active:  pushing her face forward
active:  peering at us
active:  I could see
active:  she was pretty
noverb:  ,
noverb:  from the gloss with
active:  the light shone upon her dark dress I knew
active:  it was a rich material
active:  She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
active:  asking a question
novoice: my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable
active:  she gave such a start
active:  the lamp nearly fell from her hand
active:  Colonel Stark went up to her
noverb:  whispered something in her ear
active:  pushing her back into the room from whence she had come
active:  he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
active:  Perhaps you will have the kindness
active:  to wait in this room for a few minutes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  throwing open another door
active:  It was a quiet
noverb:  little
noverb:  plainly furnished room
noverb:  with a round table in the centre
noverb:  on
passive: several German books were scattered
active:  Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door
noverb:  I shall not keep you waiting an instant
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: vanished into the darkness
active:  I glanced at the books upon the table
active:  in spite of my ignorance of German I could see
active:  two of them were treatises
noverb:  on science
active:  the others being volumes of poetry
novoice: Then I walked across to the window
active:  hoping
active:  I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
noverb:  an oak shutter
noverb:  heavily barred
active:  was folded across
noverb:  it
active:  It was a
noverb:  wonderfully silent house
active:  There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage
active:  everything was deadly still
active:  A vague feeling of uneasiness began
active:  to steal over me
active:  were these German people
active:  were they doing living in this strange
noverb:  out-of-the-way place
active:  And where was the place
active:  I was ten miles
noverb:  from Eyford
active:  that was all I knew
noverb:  north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west I had no idea
noverb:  For
noverb:  matter
noverb:  Reading
noverb:  possibly other large towns
active:  were within that radius
active:  the place might not be so secluded
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Yet
active:  it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
noverb:  that we were in the country
active:  I paced up and down the room
active:  humming a tune under my breath
active:  to keep up my spirits
noverb:  feeling
active:  I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness
active:  the door of my room swung slowly open
active:  The woman was standing in the aperture
noverb:  the darkness of the hall behind her
noverb:  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face
active:  I could see at a glance
active:  she was sick
noverb:  with fear
active:  the sight sent a chill to my own heart
active:  She held up one shaking finger
active:  to warn me
active:  to be silent
active:  she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me
active:  her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her
active:  I would go
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  trying hard
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  to speak calmly
active:  I would go
active:  I should not stay here
active:  There is no good for you
active:  to do
noverb:  madam
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I have not yet done
active:  I came for
active:  I cannot possibly leave
active:  I have seen the machine
active:  It is not worth
noverb:  your
active:  to wait
active:  she went on
active:  You can pass through the door
active:  no one hinders
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  I smiled and shook my head
active:  she suddenly threw aside her constraint
active:  made a step forward
noverb:  , with her hands wrung together
noverb:  For the love of Heaven
active:  she whispered
active:  get away from here
active:  it is too late
active:  I am somewhat headstrong
noverb:  by nature
noverb:  the
active:  ready to engage in an affair
active:  there is some obstacle
noverb:  in the way
active:  I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,
noverb:  of the unpleasant night
active:  seemed to be
noverb:  me
active:  Was it all
active:  to go for nothing
active:  should I slink away
active:  having carried out my commission
noverb:  without the payment
active:  was my due
active:  This woman might
noverb:  for all I knew
active:  be a monomaniac
noverb:  With a stout bearing
noverb:  therefore
active:  her manner had shaken me more than
active:  I cared to confess
noverb:  I still shook my head
active:  declared my intention
active:  remaining
active:  I was
active:  She was about
active:  to renew her entreaties
active:  a door slammed overhead
passive: the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
active:  She listened for an instant
active:  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture
noverb:  vanished as suddenly
active:  she had come
active:  The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark
noverb:  a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin
passive: was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson
active:  This is my secretary
noverb:  manager
active:  said
noverb:  the colonel
noverb:  By the way
active:  I was under the impression
active:  I left this door shut just now
active:  I fear
active:  you have felt the draught
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  I opened the door myself
active:  I felt the room
active:  to be a little close
active:  He shot one of his suspicious looks at me
noverb:  Perhaps we
active:  had better
active:  proceed to business
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Mr. Ferguson
active:  I will take you up
active:  to see the machine
noverb:  I had better put my hat on
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
active:  it is in the house
active:  you dig fuller's-earth in the house
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  This is only
active:  we compress it
active:  never mind that
noverb:  All we wish you
active:  to do
active:  is to examine the machine
noverb:  to let us know
active:  is wrong with it
active:  We went upstairs together
noverb:  the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him
active:  It was a labyrinth of an old house
noverb:  , with corridors
noverb:  passages
active:  narrow winding staircases
noverb:  little low doors
noverb:  the thresholds of
passive: were hollowed out by the generations
active:  had crossed them
active:  There were no carpets
noverb:  no signs of any furniture above the ground floor
active:  the plaster was peeling off the walls
active:  the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches
active:  I tried
active:  to put on as unconcerned an air as possible
active:  I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady
active:  I disregarded them
active:  I kept a keen eye upon my two companions
active:  Ferguson appeared
active:  to be a morose and silent man
active:  I could see from the little
active:  he said
active:  he was at least a
noverb:  fellow-countryman
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last
noverb:  a low door
active:  he unlocked
active:  was a small
noverb:  square room
noverb:  in
active:  the three of us could hardly get at one time
active:  Ferguson remained
active:  the colonel ushered me in
active:  We are now
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  actually within the hydraulic press
active:  it would be a
noverb:  particularly unpleasant thing for us
active:  anyone were to turn it on
active:  The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston
active:  it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
active:  There are small lateral columns of water
active:  receive the force
active:  transmit and multiply it in the manner
active:  is familiar to you
active:  The machine goes readily enough
active:  there is some stiffness
noverb:  in the working of it
active:  it has lost a little of its force
active:  Perhaps you will have the goodness
active:  to look it
active:  show us
noverb:  we can set it right
active:  I took the lamp from him
active:  I examined the machine very thoroughly
noverb:  It was indeed a gigantic one
noverb:  capable
active:  exercising enormous pressure
active:  When I passed
noverb:  however
novoice: pressed down the levers
active:  controlled it
active:  I knew at once by the whishing sound
active:  there was a slight leakage
active:  allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders
active:  An examination showed
noverb:  one of the india-rubber bands
active:  was round the head of a driving-rod
active:  had shrunk
noverb:  not quite
active:  to fill the socket along
novoice: it worked
active:  This was clearly the cause of the loss of power
active:  I pointed it out to my companions
active:  followed my remarks very carefully
active:  asked several practical questions as to
noverb:  they should proceed to set it right
active:  When I had made it clear to them
noverb:  , I returned to the main chamber of the machine
active:  took a good look at it
active:  to satisfy my own curiosity
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  at a glance
noverb:  the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication
active:  for it would be absurd
active:  to suppose
noverb:  powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
active:  The walls were of wood
novoice: the floor consisted of a large iron trough
active:  I came to examine it
active:  I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
active:  I had stooped and was scraping at this
active:  to see exactly
active:  it was
active:  I heard a muttered exclamation in German
active:  saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
active:  are you doing there
active:  he asked
active:  I felt angry
passive: having been tricked by
active:  elaborate a story as
active:  he had told me
active:  I was admiring your fuller's-earth
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I think
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you as to your machine
active:  I knew
active:  the exact purpose was for
passive: it was used
noverb:  The instant
active:  I uttered the words
active:  I regretted the rashness of my speech
noverb:  His face set hard
active:  a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
noverb:  Very well
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you shall know all about the machine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  slammed the little door
active:  turned the key in the lock
active:  I rushed towards
noverb:  it
novoice: pulled at the handle
active:  it was quite secure
noverb:  ,
active:  did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves
noverb:  Hullo
active:  I yelled
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Colonel
active:  Let me out
noverb:  And then suddenly in the silence
active:  I heard a sound
active:  sent my heart into my mouth
active:  It was the clank of the levers and the swish
noverb:  of the leaking cylinder
active:  He had set the engine at work
active:  The lamp still stood upon the floor
active:  I had placed it
active:  examining the trough
active:  By its light I saw
active:  the black ceiling was coming down upon me
noverb:  slowly
noverb:  jerkily
active:  none knew better
noverb:  myself
noverb:  with a force
active:  must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
active:  I threw myself
active:  screaming, against the door,
novoice: dragged with my nails at the lock
active:  I implored the colonel
active:  to let me out
active:  the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries
active:  The ceiling was only a foot
noverb:  two above my head
passive: with my hand upraised
active:  I could feel its hard
noverb:  rough surface
active:  it flashed through my mind
active:  the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in
active:  I met it
active:  If I lay on my face the weight
active:  would come upon my spine
active:  I shuddered
active:  to think of
noverb:  dreadful snap
noverb:  Easier the other way
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  and
noverb:  had I the nerve
active:  to lie and look up at
noverb:  deadly black shadow wavering down upon me
active:  Already I was unable
active:  to stand erect
novoice: my eye caught something
active:  brought a gush of hope back to my heart
active:  I have said
noverb:  the floor
active:  ceiling were of iron
active:  the walls were of wood
active:  As I gave a last
active:  hurried glance around
active:  I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards
active:  broadened and broadened
passive: a small panel was pushed backward
active:  For an instant I could hardly believe
active:  here was indeed a door
active:  led away from death
noverb:  The next instant
active:  I threw myself through
noverb:  lay half-fainting upon the other side
active:  The panel had closed again behind me
noverb:  the crash of the lamp
noverb:  a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal
active:  told me
noverb:  narrow had been my escape
passive: I was recalled
active:  to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist
active:  I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor
passive: a woman bent over me
novoice: tugged at me with her left hand
active:  she held a candle in her right
active:  It was the same good friend
noverb:  warning I had
noverb:  foolishly rejected
active:  Come! come
active:  she cried breathlessly
active:  They will be here
noverb:  in a moment
active:  They will see
active:  you are not there
noverb:  Oh
active:  do not waste the so-precious time
active:  come
noverb:  This time
noverb:  at least
noverb:  I did not scorn her advice
active:  I staggered to my feet
active:  ran with her along the corridor
noverb:  down a winding stair
active:  The latter led to another broad passage
noverb:  just
active:  we reached it
active:  we heard the sound of running feet
noverb:  the shouting of two voices
active:  one answering the other from the floor on
active:  we were
noverb:  from the one beneath
noverb:  My guide stopped and looked about her
noverb:  one
active:  is at her wit's end
noverb:  she threw open a door
active:  led into a bedroom
noverb:  through the window of
active:  the moon was shining brightly
active:  It is your only chance
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  It is high
active:  it may be
active:  you can jump it
active:  she spoke a light
active:  sprang into view at the further end of the passage
active:  I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon
noverb:  a butcher's cleaver in the other
active:  I rushed across the bedroom
noverb:  flung open the window
novoice: looked out
noverb:  quiet and sweet
noverb:  wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight
active:  it could not be more than thirty feet down
active:  I clambered out upon the sill
active:  I hesitated
active:  to jump
active:  I should have heard
novoice: passed between my saviour and the ruffian
active:  pursued me
active:  she were ill-used
noverb:  ,
noverb:  at any risks
passive: I was determined
active:  to go back to her assistance
active:  The thought had hardly flashed through my mind
active:  he was at the door
active:  pushing his way past her
active:  she threw her arms
active:  round him
active:  tried
noverb:  to hold him back
noverb:  Fritz
noverb:  Fritz
active:  she cried in English
active:  remember your promise after the last time
active:  You said
active:  it should not be again
active:  He will be silent
noverb:  Oh
active:  he will be silent
active:  You are mad
noverb:  , Elise
active:  he shouted
noverb:  struggling
active:  to break away from her
active:  You will be the ruin of us
active:  He has seen too much
noverb:  Let me pass
active:  I say
active:  He dashed her to one side
noverb:  rushing to the window
noverb:  cut at me with his heavy weapon
noverb:  I had let myself go
active:  was hanging by the hands to the sill
noverb:  his blow fell
active:  I was conscious
noverb:  of a dull pain
noverb:  my grip loosened
active:  I fell into the garden below
passive: I was shaken
novoice: not hurt by the fall
active:  I picked myself up
active:  rushed off among the bushes
active:  I could run
noverb:  for I understood
active:  I was far
noverb:  from being out of danger
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  I ran
noverb:  a deadly dizziness
active:  sickness came over me
active:  I glanced down at my hand
active:  was throbbing painfully
noverb:  for the first time
noverb:  saw
passive: my thumb had been cut off
active:  the blood was pouring from my wound
active:  I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it
active:  there came a sudden
active:  buzzing in my ears
noverb:  next moment
active:  I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
noverb:  long I remained unconscious
active:  I cannot tell
active:  It must have been a very long time
active:  for the moon had sunk
active:  a bright morning was breaking
active:  I came to myself
active:  My clothes were all sodden with dew
noverb:  my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
active:  The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure
active:  I sprang to my feet with the feeling
active:  I might hardly
active:  be safe from my pursuers
noverb:  to my astonishment
active:  I came
active:  to look
active:  round me
noverb:  neither house
active:  garden were to be seen
active:  I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad
noverb:  just a little lower
active:  was a long building
noverb:  proved
noverb:  upon my approaching it
active:  to be the very station at
active:  I had arrived upon the previous night
active:  Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand
noverb:  all
active:  had passed
active:  during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
noverb:  Half dazed
active:  I went into the station
novoice: asked about the morning train
active:  There would be one
noverb:  to Reading in less than an hour
active:  The same porter was on duty
active:  I found
active:  had been there
active:  I arrived
active:  I inquired of him
active:  he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark
active:  The name was strange to him
noverb:  Had he observed a carriage the night
noverb:  waiting for me
noverb:  No
active:  he had not
noverb:  Was there a police-station anywhere near
active:  There was one
noverb:  about three miles off
active:  It was too far for me
active:  to go
noverb:  weak and ill
active:  I was
active:  I determined
active:  to wait
active:  I got back to town
active:  telling my story to the police
noverb:  It was a little past six
active:  I arrived
active:  I went first
noverb:  to have my wound dressed
active:  the doctor was kind enough
active:  to bring me along here
active:  I put the case into your hands
active:  shall do exactly
active:  you advise
noverb:  We
noverb:  sat in silence for some little time
active:  listening to this extraordinary narrative
novoice: Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in
active:  he placed his cuttings
active:  Here is an advertisement
active:  will interest you
active:  said he
active:  It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
active:  Listen to this
noverb:  Lost
noverb:  on the 9th inst
noverb:  Mr. Jeremiah Hayling
passive: aged twenty-six
noverb:  a hydraulic engineer
active:  Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night
passive: has not been heard of
passive: Was dressed in
noverb:  etc
noverb:  etc
noverb:  Ha
active:  That represents the last time
active:  the colonel needed to have his machine
novoice: overhauled
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  cried my patient
active:  explains
active:  the girl said
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  It is quite clear
noverb:  that the colonel was a cool and desperate man
active:  was absolutely determined
active:  nothing should stand in the way of his little game
noverb:  like those out-and-out pirates
active:  will leave no survivor from a captured ship
noverb:  Well,
active:  every moment now is precious
active:  you feel equal to it
active:  we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary
active:  to starting for Eyford
noverb:  Some three hours
noverb:  afterwards
active:  we were all
noverb:  in the train together
noverb:  bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village
noverb:  There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man
noverb:  myself
active:  Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat
active:  was busy with his compasses
active:  drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
noverb:  There
active:  you are
active:  said he
passive: That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
noverb:  The place we want must be somewhere near
noverb:  line
active:  You said ten miles
active:  I think
noverb:  sir
active:  It was an hour's good drive
noverb:  And you think
active:  they brought
active:  you back all
noverb:  way
active:  you were unconscious
active:  They must have done
active:  I have a confused memory
noverb:  too
passive: having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
active:  I cannot understand
active:  said I
active:  is
active:  they should have spared you
active:  they found
active:  you lying
active:  fainting in the garden
passive: Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties
active:  I hardly think
noverb:  likely
active:  I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
noverb:  Oh
active:  we shall soon clear up all that
active:  said Bradstreet
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have drawn my circle
active:  I only wish
active:  I knew at
noverb:  point upon it the folk
active:  we are in search
active:  are to be found
active:  I think
active:  I could lay my finger on it
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  now
active:  cried the inspector
active:  you have formed your opinion
active:  Come
noverb:  now
active:  we shall see
active:  agrees with
noverb:  you
active:  I say
active:  it is south
noverb:  , for the country is more deserted there
active:  And I say east
active:  said my patient
active:  I am for west
active:  remarked the plain-clothes man
noverb:  There are several quiet little villages up there
active:  And I am for north
active:  said I
active:  there are no hills
noverb:  there
active:  our friend says
active:  he did not notice the carriage
active:  go up any
active:  Come
active:  cried the inspector
noverb:  laughing
active:  it's a very pretty diversity of opinion
active:  We have boxed the compass among us
active:  do you give your casting vote to
active:  You are all
active:  wrong
noverb:  we can't all be
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  you can
active:  This is my point
active:  He placed his finger in the centre of the circle
active:  This is
active:  we shall find them
noverb:  the twelve-mile drive
active:  gasped Hatherley
noverb:  Six out
noverb:  six back
noverb:  Nothing simpler
active:  You say yourself
active:  the horse was fresh and glossy
active:  you got in
active:  could it be
active:  it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it is a likely ruse enough
active:  observed Bradstreet thoughtfully
noverb:  Of course
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  as to the nature of this gang
noverb:  None at all
active:  said Holmes
active:  They are coiners
noverb:  on a large scale
active:  have used the machine
active:  to form the amalgam
active:  has taken the place of silver
active:  We have known for some time
active:  a clever gang was at work
active:  said the inspector
active:  They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
active:  We even traced them
noverb:  Reading
active:  could get no farther
noverb:  for they had covered their traces in a way
active:  showed
active:  they were very old hands
noverb:  now
noverb:  thanks to this lucky chance
active:  I think
active:  we have got them right enough
passive: the inspector was mistaken
passive: for those criminals were not destined
active:  to fall into the hands of justice
noverb:  As we rolled into Eyford Station
active:  we saw a gigantic column of smoke
active:  streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood
noverb:  hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
noverb:  A house on fire
active:  asked Bradstreet
active:  the train steamed off again on its way
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  said the station-master
active:  When did it break out
active:  I hear
active:  it was during the night
noverb:  sir
active:  it has got worse
active:  the whole place is in a blaze
active:  house is it
noverb:  Dr. Becher's
active:  Tell me
active:  broke in the engineer
noverb:  is Dr. Becher a German
noverb:  very thin
noverb:  with a long, sharp nose
active:  The station-master laughed heartily
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  Dr. Becher is an Englishman
noverb:  there isn't a man in the parish
active:  has a better-lined waistcoat
active:  he has a gentleman
active:  staying with him
noverb:  a patient
active:  I understand
noverb:  who is a foreigner
active:  he looks as
noverb:  a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
active:  The station-master had not finished his speech
active:  we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
active:  The road topped a low hill
active:  there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us
noverb:  spouting fire at every chink
noverb:  window
noverb:  in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
active:  That's it

active:  I lay
active:  second window is the one
active:  I jumped from
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  at least
active:  said Holmes
active:  you have had your revenge upon them
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  that it was your oil-lamp
active:  it was crushed
noverb:  in the press
noverb:  set fire to the wooden walls
noverb:  no doubt
active:  they were too excited
noverb:  in the chase after you
active:  to observe it at the time
noverb:  Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night
noverb:  I very much fear
noverb:  they are a good hundred miles off by now
active:  And Holmes' fears came to be realised
noverb:  for from that day to this no word has
passive: ever been heard
noverb:  of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman
noverb:  Early
noverb:  morning a peasant had met a cart
active:  containing several people
noverb:  some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading
noverb:  there all traces of the fugitives disappeared
novoice: even Holmes' ingenuity failed
active:  to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
active:  The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
active:  they had found within
noverb:  still
active:  discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
noverb:  About sunset
noverb:  however
active:  their efforts were at last successful
active:  they subdued the flames
noverb:  not
active:  the roof had fallen in
passive: the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin
noverb:  save some twisted cylinders
noverb:  iron piping

active:  had cost our unfortunate acquaintance
noverb:  dearly
noverb:  Large masses of nickel
passive: of tin were discovered
novoice: stored in an out-house
active:  no coins were to be found
active:  may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes
passive: have been already referred to
passive: our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot
active:  he recovered his senses
active:  might have remained forever a mystery
active:  were it not for the soft mould
noverb:  told us a very plain tale
passive: He had evidently been carried down by two persons
noverb:  one of
active:  had remarkably small feet
noverb:  the other unusually large ones
noverb:  On the whole
active:  it was most
noverb:  probable
noverb:  the silent Englishman
active:  being less bold
noverb:  less murderous
noverb:  his companion
active:  had assisted the woman
active:  to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
noverb:  Well
active:  said our engineer ruefully
active:  we took our seats
active:  to return once
noverb:  to London
active:  it has been a pretty business for me
active:  I have lost my thumb
active:  I have lost a fifty-guinea fee
active:  have I gained
noverb:  Experience
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  Indirectly it may be of value
active:  you know
active:  you have only
active:  to put it into words
active:  to gain the reputation
active:  being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
noverb:  X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
noverb:  The Lord St. Simon marriage
noverb:  its curious termination
active:  have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in
active:  the unfortunate bridegroom moves
active:  Fresh scandals have eclipsed it
active:  their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama
active:  As I have reason
active:  to believe
noverb:  however
passive: the full facts have never been revealed to the general public
active:  my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share
active:  clearing the matter up
active:  I feel
active:  no memoir of him would be complete
noverb:  without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
active:  It was a few weeks
noverb:  my own marriage
noverb:  during the days
active:  I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street
active:  he came home from an afternoon stroll
active:  to find a letter on the table waiting for him
active:  I had remained indoors all day
active:  for the weather had taken a sudden turn
active:  to rain, with high autumnal winds,
noverb:  the Jezail bullet
active:  I had brought back in one of my limbs
active:  a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
noverb:  With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another
active:  I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
passive: saturated with the news of the day
noverb:  I tossed them all aside
active:  lay listless
noverb:  watching the huge crest
noverb:  monogram upon the envelope upon the table
active:  wondering lazily
active:  my friend's noble correspondent could be
active:  Here is a very fashionable epistle
active:  I remarked
active:  he entered
noverb:  Your morning letters
active:  I remember right
active:  were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
noverb:  Yes
active:  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety
active:  he answered
noverb:  smiling
active:  and the humbler are usually the more interesting
active:  This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses
noverb:  call upon a man
passive: to be bored
active:  to lie
active:  He broke the seal
active:  glanced over the contents
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
active:  it may prove to be something of interest
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Not social
noverb:  No
noverb:  distinctly professional
noverb:  And from a noble client
noverb:  One of the highest in England
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  I congratulate you
active:  I assure you
noverb:  Watson, without affectation,
active:  the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
noverb:  the interest of his case
active:  It is just possible
noverb:  , however
active:  also may not be wanting in this new investigation
active:  You have been reading the papers diligently of late
active:  have you not
active:  It looks like
noverb:  it
active:  said I ruefully
active:  pointing to a huge bundle in the corner
active:  I have had nothing else
active:  to do
active:  It is fortunate
noverb:  , for you will perhaps be able
active:  to post me up
active:  I read nothing
noverb:  the criminal news and the agony column
active:  The latter is always instructive
active:  you have followed recent events
active:  closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  with the deepest interest
active:  That is well
noverb:  The letter
active:  I hold
active:  in my hand is from Lord St. Simon

noverb:  therefore
active:  to call upon
noverb:  you
active:  to consult you in reference to the very painful event
active:  has occurred in connection with my wedding
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter
active:  he assures me
active:  he sees no objection to your co-operation
noverb:  he even thinks
active:  it might be of some assistance
active:  I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon
active:  should you have any other engagement at
noverb:  time
active:  I hope
active:  you will postpone it
active:  this matter is of paramount importance
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  ST. SIMON
passive: It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions
active:  written with a quill pen
active:  the noble lord has had the misfortune
active:  to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger

active:  He says four o'clock
active:  It is three
noverb:  now
active:  He will be here
noverb:  in an hour
active:  I have just time, with your assistance,
active:  to get clear upon the subject
noverb:  Turn over those papers
active:  arrange the extracts in their order of time
active:  I take a glance as to
active:  our client is

noverb:  Tudor on the distaff side
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  very instructive in all this
active:  I think
active:  I must turn to
noverb:  you Watson
noverb:  for something more solid
active:  I have very little difficulty
active:  finding
active:  I want
active:  said I
active:  for the facts are quite recent
active:  the matter struck me as remarkable
active:  I feared to refer them to you
noverb:  however
active:  I knew
active:  you had an inquiry on hand
active:  you disliked the intrusion of other matters
noverb:  Oh
active:  you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van
active:  That is quite cleared up now
noverb:  indeed
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  Pray
noverb:  give me the results of your newspaper selections
active:  Here is the first notice
active:  I can find
active:  It is in the personal column of the Morning Post
noverb:  dates
noverb:  as you see
active:  some weeks back

noverb:  Terse
noverb:  to the point
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  stretching his long
active:  thin legs towards the fire
active:  There was a paragraph
active:  amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  here it is
active:  There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market
active:  for the present free-trade principle appears
active:  to tell heavily against our home product

noverb:  Anything else
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  plenty

noverb:  Hanover Square
noverb:  only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited

noverb:  Indeed
active:  This is more interesting
novoice: it promised
active:  to be
noverb:  quite dramatic
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  it struck me
active:  being a little out of the common
active:  They often vanish
noverb:  the ceremony
noverb:  occasionally during the honeymoon
active:  I cannot call
active:  to mind anything quite
noverb:  prompt as this
active:  Pray
noverb:  let me have the details
active:  I warn you
active:  they are very incomplete
active:  Perhaps we may make them
noverb:  Such as they are

active:  it is only now
active:  it has been possible
active:  to confirm the strange rumours
active:  have been
active:  persistently floating about
noverb:  In spite of the attempts of the friends
active:  to hush the matter up
noverb:  much public attention has

active:  It appears
passive: some little trouble was caused by a woman
passive: name has not been ascertained
active:  endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party
active:  alleging
active:  she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon
active:  It was only after a painful
noverb:  prolonged scene
passive: she was ejected by the butler and the footman

novoice: apparelled

noverb:  , believing her

active:  ascertaining
active:  his daughter had disappeared
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  in conjunction with the bridegroom
novoice: put themselves in communication with the police
passive: very energetic inquiries are being made
active:  will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
noverb:  Up to a late hour last night
noverb:  however
active:  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady
active:  There are rumours
noverb:  of foul play in the matter
active:  it is said
active:  the police have caused the arrest of the woman
active:  had caused the original disturbance
noverb:  in the belief
passive: from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
active:  And is
noverb:  all

noverb:  And an exceedingly interesting case it appears
active:  to be
active:  I would not have missed it for worlds
active:  there is a ring
noverb:  at the bell, Watson,
active:  as the clock makes it a few minutes after four
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this will prove to be our noble client
active:  Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer
active:  having a witness
noverb:  only as a check to my own memory
noverb:  Lord Robert St. Simon
active:  announced our page-boy
noverb:  throwing open the door
active:  A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale
noverb:  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
noverb:  with the steady, well-opened eye of a man
noverb:  pleasant lot
active:  it had ever been
active:  to command
passive: to be obeyed
active:  His manner was brisk
active:  his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
noverb:  for he had a slight forward stoop
noverb:  a little bend of the knees
active:  he walked
noverb:  His hair
noverb:  too
noverb:  as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat
active:  was grizzled round the edges

noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  Draw up a little to the fire
active:  we will talk this matter over
noverb:  A most painful matter to me
noverb:  as you can most readily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: I have been cut to the quick
active:  I understand
active:  you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
active:  I presume
active:  they were hardly from the same class of society
noverb:  No
active:  I am descending
active:  I beg pardon
active:  My last client of the sort was a king
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  really
active:  I had no idea
noverb:  And
noverb:  king
noverb:  The King of Scandinavia
passive: Had
active:  he lost his wife
active:  You can understand
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
active:  I promise to
noverb:  you in yours
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  Very right! very right
noverb:  I'm sure I beg pardon
noverb:  As to my own case
active:  I am ready
noverb:  to give you any information
active:  may assist you
active:  forming an opinion
active:  Thank you
active:  I have already learned all
active:  is in the public prints
noverb:  nothing
active:  I presume
active:  I may take it as correct
noverb:  this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride
novoice: Lord St. Simon glanced over
noverb:  it
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is correct
noverb:  ,
active:  it goes
active:  it needs a great deal
active:  supplementing
active:  anyone could offer an opinion
active:  I think
active:  I may arrive at my facts most directly
active:  questioning you
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
noverb:  In San Francisco
noverb:  a year ago
active:  You were travelling in the States
noverb:  Yes
active:  Did you become engaged
noverb:  No
active:  you were on a friendly footing
passive: I was amused by her society
active:  she could see
passive: I was amused
active:  Her father is very rich
passive: He is said
active:  to be the richest man on the Pacific slope
noverb:  And
active:  did he make his money
noverb:  In mining
active:  He had nothing a few years ago
noverb:  he struck gold
active:  invested it
active:  came up by leaps and bounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  is your own impression as to the young lady's
noverb:  your wife's character
active:  The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster
novoice: stared down into the fire
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  my wife was twenty
active:  her father became a rich man
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  she ran free in a mining camp
active:  wandered through woods
noverb:  mountains
active:  her education has come from Nature rather
noverb:  from the schoolmaster
active:  She is
active:  we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild
noverb:  free
noverb:  unfettered by any sort of traditions
active:  She is impetuous
noverb:  --volcanic
active:  I was about
active:  to say
active:  She is swift
noverb:  in making up her mind
noverb:  fearless
active:  carrying out her resolutions
noverb:  On the other hand
noverb:  I would not have given her the name
active:  I have the honour
active:  to bear
noverb:  --he gave a little stately cough--
active:  had I not thought her
active:  to be at bottom a noble woman
active:  I believe
active:  she is capable
noverb:  of heroic self-sacrifice
noverb:  anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
active:  Have you her photograph
active:  I brought this with me
active:  He opened a locket
noverb:  showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
active:  It was not a photograph
noverb:  but an ivory miniature
active:  the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair
noverb:  the large dark eyes
noverb:  the exquisite mouth
active:  Holmes gazed long
noverb:  earnestly at it
active:  he closed the locket
active:  handed it back to Lord St. Simon
active:  The young lady came to London
active:  you renewed your acquaintance
noverb:  Yes
active:  her father brought her over for this last London season
active:  I met her several times
active:  became engaged to her
active:  have
active:  now married her
active:  She brought
active:  I understand
noverb:  a considerable dowry
noverb:  A fair dowry
active:  Not more than is usual in my family
noverb:  And this
noverb:  of course
noverb:  remains to you
active:  the marriage is a fait accompli
active:  I really have made no inquiries on the subject
noverb:  Very naturally not
active:  Did you see Miss Doran on the day
noverb:  the wedding
noverb:  Yes
active:  Was she in good spirits
noverb:  Never better
active:  She kept talking of
active:  we should do in our future lives
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is very interesting
noverb:  And on the morning of the wedding
active:  She was
noverb:  possible
noverb:  at least until after the ceremony
active:  And did you observe any change in her
noverb:  Well,
active:  to tell the truth
active:  I saw
noverb:  the first signs
active:  I had
noverb:  seen
active:  her temper was just a little sharp
noverb:  The incident however
active:  was too trivial
active:  to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
active:  Pray
noverb:  let us have it
noverb:  for all that
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is childish
active:  She dropped her bouquet
active:  we went towards the vestry
active:  She was passing the front pew at the time
noverb:  it fell over into the pew
active:  There was a moment's delay
active:  the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again
active:  it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
active:  Yet when I spoke to her of the matter
active:  she answered me abruptly
noverb:  and in the carriage
noverb:  on our way home
active:  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
noverb:  Indeed
active:  You say
active:  there was a gentleman
noverb:  in the pew
active:  Some of the general public were present
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  It is impossible
active:  to exclude them
active:  the church is open
active:  This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  I call him a gentleman by courtesy
active:  he was quite a common-looking person
active:  I hardly noticed his appearance
active:  really I think
active:  we are wandering rather far from the point
noverb:  Lady St. Simon
novoice: returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind
active:  she had gone to
noverb:  it
active:  did
noverb:  she do on re-entering her father's house
active:  I saw her in conversation with her maid
noverb:  And
noverb:  is her maid
noverb:  Alice is her name
active:  She is an American
active:  came from California with her
noverb:  A confidential servant
noverb:  A little too much
active:  It seemed to me
active:  her mistress allowed her
active:  to take great liberties
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  in America they look upon these things in a different way
noverb:  long did she speak to this Alice
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  a few minutes
active:  I had something else
active:  to think of
active:  You did not overhear
active:  they said
active:  Lady St. Simon said
noverb:  something about 'jumping a claim
passive: She was accustomed
active:  to use slang of the kind
active:  I have no idea
active:  she meant
active:  American slang is very expressive sometimes
noverb:  And
active:  did your wife
active:  do
active:  she finished speaking to her maid
active:  She walked into the breakfast-room
noverb:  On your arm
noverb:  No
noverb:  alone
active:  She was very independent
noverb:  in little matters
noverb:  that
noverb:  after we had sat down for ten minutes
active:  she rose hurriedly
active:  muttered some words of apology
active:  left the room
active:  She never came back
noverb:  this maid, Alice
active:  I understand
active:  deposes
active:  she went to her room
active:  covered her bride's dress with a long ulster
noverb:  put on a bonnet
active:  went out
noverb:  Quite
active:  And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
noverb:  a woman
active:  is now in custody
noverb:  had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
noverb:  your relations to her
active:  Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders
active:  raised his eyebrows
active:  We have been on a friendly footing for some years
active:  I may say on a very friendly footing
active:  She used
active:  to be at the Allegro
active:  I have not treated her ungenerously
active:  she had no just cause of complaint against me
active:  you know
active:  women are
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Flora was a dear little thing
noverb:  exceedingly hot-headed
novoice: devotedly attached to me
noverb:  She wrote me dreadful letters
active:  she heard
active:  I was about
passive: to be married
active:  to tell the truth
noverb:  the reason
noverb:  I had the marriage celebrated
active:  quietly was
active:  I feared
active:  there might be a scandal
noverb:  in the church
active:  She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we
active:  returned
active:  she endeavoured to push her way in
active:  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife
active:  even threatening her
active:  I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort
noverb:  I had two police fellows there in private clothes
active:  soon pushed her out again
active:  She was quiet
noverb:  when she saw
active:  there was no good
active:  making a row
active:  Did your wife hear all this
noverb:  No
active:  thank goodness
active:  she did not
active:  And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
noverb:  Yes
active:  That is
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious
active:  It is thought
active:  Flora decoyed my wife out
active:  laid some terrible trap for her
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a possible supposition
active:  You think
noverb:  too
active:  I did not say a probable one
noverb:  you do not yourself look upon this as likely
active:  I do not think Flora
active:  would hurt a fly
noverb:  Still,
active:  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters
active:  Pray
active:  is your own theory as to
active:  took place
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I came to seek a theory
noverb:  not
active:  to propound one
noverb:  I have given you all the facts
active:  you ask me
noverb:  however
active:  I may say
active:  it has occurred to me as possible
noverb:  the excitement of this affair
noverb:  the consciousness
active:  she had made so immense a social stride
active:  had the effect
active:  causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
noverb:  In short
active:  she had become suddenly deranged
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I consider
active:  she has turned her back
active:  I will not say upon me
noverb:  upon
noverb:  much
noverb:  many have aspired to without success
active:  I can hardly explain it in any other fashion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  certainly
active:  is also a conceivable hypothesis
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I think
active:  I have nearly all my data
active:  May I ask
passive: you were seated at the breakfast-table
active:  you could see out of the window
active:  We could see the other side of the road and the Park
noverb:  Quite
active:  Then I do not think
active:  I need to detain you longer
active:  I shall communicate with
noverb:  you
passive: Should
active:  you be fortunate enough
active:  to solve this problem
active:  said our client, rising
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Eh
active:  was that
active:  I say
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Where
active:  is my wife
active:  That is a detail
active:  I shall speedily supply
active:  Lord St. Simon shook his head
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it will take wiser heads
noverb:  yours
noverb:  mine
active:  he remarked
noverb:  bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner
active:  he departed
active:  It is very good
noverb:  of Lord St. Simon
active:  to honour my head
active:  putting it on a level with his own
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I think
active:  I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning
active:  I had formed my conclusions as to the case
active:  our client came into the room
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  I have notes of several similar cases
noverb:  none
active:  I remarked before
active:  were quite as prompt
active:  My whole examination served
active:  to turn my conjecture into a certainty
active:  Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing
noverb:  as
active:  you find a trout in the milk
active:  to quote Thoreau's example
active:  I have heard all
active:  you have heard
noverb:  Without
noverb:  however
noverb:  the knowledge of pre-existing cases
active:  serves me
noverb:  well
noverb:  There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back
noverb:  something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War
active:  It is one of these cases
noverb:  hullo
active:  here is Lestrade
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard
active:  there are cigars
noverb:  in the box
passive: The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket
noverb:  cravat
active:  gave him a decidedly nautical appearance
active:  he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
active:  With a short greeting he seated himself
active:  lit the cigar
passive: had been offered to him
active:  What's up
active:  asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye
active:  You look dissatisfied
active:  And I feel dissatisfied
active:  It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case
active:  I can make
noverb:  head
noverb:  tail of the business
noverb:  Really
active:  You surprise me
novoice: ever heard of such a mixed affair
active:  Every clue seems
active:  to slip through my fingers
active:  I have been at work upon it all day
noverb:  And very wet it seems to have made you
noverb:  said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have been dragging the Serpentine
noverb:  In heaven's name
noverb:  for
noverb:  In search of the body of Lady St. Simon
active:  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair
novoice: laughed heartily
active:  Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain
active:  he asked
noverb:  do you mean
active:  you have just as good a chance
active:  finding this lady in the one as in the other
active:  Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion
active:  I suppose
active:  you know all about it
active:  he snarled
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have only just heard the facts
passive: my mind is made up
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  you think
noverb:  the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
active:  I think it very unlikely
noverb:  perhaps you will kindly explain
active:  it is
active:  we found this in it
active:  He opened his bag as he spoke
active:  tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk
noverb:  a pair of white satin shoes
noverb:  a bride's wreath
noverb:  veil
noverb:  all discoloured and soaked in water
noverb:  There
active:  said he
active:  putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile
active:  There is a little nut for you
active:  to crack
noverb:  Master Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  said
noverb:  my friend
noverb:  blowing blue rings into the air
active:  You dragged them from the Serpentine
noverb:  No
noverb:  They
passive: were found
active:  floating near the margin by a park-keeper
passive: They have been identified as her clothes
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  the clothes were there
active:  the body would not be far off
noverb:  By the same brilliant reasoning
active:  every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe
active:  And pray
active:  did you hope
active:  to arrive at through this
active:  At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that you will find it difficult
active:  Are you
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  now
active:  cried Lestrade with some bitterness
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , Holmes
active:  you are not very practical
noverb:  with your deductions and your inferences
active:  You have made two blunders in as many minutes
active:  This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  And
active:  In the dress is a pocket
active:  In the pocket is a card-case
active:  In the card-case is a note
active:  And here is the very note
active:  He slapped it down upon the table in front of him
active:  Listen to this
active:  You will see me
noverb:  all is ready
active:  Come at once
noverb:  F. H. M.' Now my theory all
active:  has been
passive: Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar
noverb:  she, with confederates, no doubt
active:  was responsible for her disappearance
noverb:  Here,
passive: signed with her initials
active:  is the very note
passive: was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door
active:  lured her within their reach
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  You really are very fine indeed
noverb:  Let me see it
active:  He took up the paper in a listless way
noverb:  his attention
active:  became
novoice: riveted
active:  he gave a little cry of satisfaction
active:  This is indeed important
active:  said he
noverb:  Ha! you find it
noverb:  Extremely
active:  I congratulate you warmly
active:  Lestrade rose in his triumph
active:  bent his head
active:  to look
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  you
active:  looking at the wrong side
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  this is the right side
noverb:  The right side
noverb:  You're mad
noverb:  Here is the note written in pencil over here
active:  And over here is
active:  appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill
active:  interests me deeply
active:  There's nothing in it
active:  I looked at it before
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  Oct. 4th
noverb:  rooms 8s
noverb:  breakfast 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  cocktail 1s
noverb:  lunch 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  glass sherry
noverb:  8d
active:  I see nothing in that
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  It is most
noverb:  important
noverb:  all the same
noverb:  As to the note
active:  it is important also
noverb:  ,
active:  at least the initials are
active:  I congratulate you again
noverb:  I've wasted time enough
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  rising
active:  I believe in hard work
noverb:  not
active:  sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
noverb:  Good-day, Mr. Holmes
active:  we shall see
active:  gets to the bottom of the matter first
active:  He gathered up the garments
novoice: thrust them into the bag
novoice: made for the door
noverb:  Just one hint to you, Lestrade
active:  drawled Holmes
noverb:  his rival vanished
noverb:  I will tell you the true solution of the matter
active:  Lady St. Simon is a myth
active:  There is not
active:  there never has been
noverb:  any such person
active:  Lestrade looked sadly at my companion
active:  he turned to me
noverb:  tapped his forehead three times
active:  shook his head solemnly
noverb:  hurried away
active:  He had hardly shut the door behind him
active:  Holmes rose
active:  to put on his overcoat
active:  There is something
noverb:  in
active:  the fellow says about outdoor work
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  I must leave you to your papers for a little
active:  It was after five o'clock
active:  Sherlock Holmes left me
novoice: I had no time
active:  to be lonely
noverb:  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box
noverb:  This
active:  he unpacked with the help of a youth
active:  he had brought with him
active:  presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began
passive: to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany
active:  There were a couple
noverb:  of brace of cold woodcock
noverb:  a pheasant
noverb:  a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles
active:  Having laid out all these luxuries
active:  my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save
passive: the things had been paid for
passive: were ordered to this address
noverb:  Just
noverb:  nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room
passive: His features were gravely set
active:  there was a light in his eye
active:  made me think
passive: he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
active:  They have laid the supper
active:  he said
active:  rubbing his hands
active:  You seem to expect company
active:  They have laid for five
noverb:  Yes
active:  I fancy
active:  we may have some company
active:  dropping in
active:  said he
active:  I am surprised
active:  Lord St. Simon has not already arrived
noverb:  Ha
active:  I fancy
active:  I hear his step now upon the stairs
active:  It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon
active:  came bustling in
active:  dangling his glasses more vigorously
noverb:  with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
active:  My messenger reached you
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I confess
active:  the contents startled me beyond measure
noverb:  Have you good authority for
active:  you say
noverb:  The best possible
active:  Lord St. Simon sank into a chair
active:  passed his hand over his forehead
active:  will the Duke
active:  say
active:  he murmured
active:  when he hears
passive: one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
active:  It is the purest accident
active:  I cannot allow
active:  there is any humiliation
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  you look on these things from another standpoint
active:  I fail
active:  to see
active:  anyone is
active:  to blame
active:  I can hardly see
active:  the lady could have acted
noverb:  her abrupt method
active:  doing
active:  it was undoubtedly
passive: to be regretted
active:  Having no mother
active:  she had no one
active:  to advise her at such a crisis
active:  It was a slight
noverb:  sir
noverb:  a public slight
active:  said Lord St. Simon
active:  tapping his fingers upon the table
active:  You must make allowance for this poor girl
noverb:  placed in so unprecedented a position
active:  I will make no allowance
active:  I am very angry indeed
noverb:  ,
passive: I have been shamefully used
active:  I think
active:  I heard a ring
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Yes
novoice: there are steps on the landing
active:  If I cannot persuade you
active:  to take a lenient view of the matter
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I have brought an advocate here
active:  may be more successful
active:  He opened the door
active:  ushered in a lady and gentleman
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said he
active:  allow me
active:  to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton
noverb:  The lady
active:  I think
active:  you have already met
active:  At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat
active:  stood very erect
novoice: with his eyes cast down
passive: his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat
noverb:  a picture of offended dignity
active:  The lady had taken a quick step forward
active:  had held out her hand to him
novoice: he still refused
active:  to raise his eyes
active:  It was as well for his resolution
noverb:  perhaps
active:  for her pleading face was one
active:  it was hard
active:  to resist
noverb:  You're angry
noverb:  Robert
active:  said she
noverb:  Well,
active:  I guess
active:  you have every cause
active:  to be
noverb:  Pray make no apology to me
active:  said Lord St. Simon bitterly
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I know
active:  I have treated you real bad
active:  I should have spoken to
noverb:  you
active:  I went
active:  I was kind
noverb:  of rattled
noverb:  from the time
active:  I saw Frank here again I just didn't know
active:  I was doing or saying
active:  I only wonder I didn't fall down
noverb:  do a faint right there
noverb:  the altar
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mrs. Moulton
active:  you would like my friend
noverb:  me
active:  to leave the room
active:  you explain this matter
active:  I may give an opinion
active:  remarked the strange gentleman
noverb:  we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already
noverb:  For my part
active:  I should like all Europe and America
active:  to hear the rights of it
active:  He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face
noverb:  alert manner
active:  I'll tell our story right away
active:  said the lady
noverb:  Frank here
active:  I met in '84
noverb:  in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies,
active:  Pa was working a claim
passive: We were engaged to each other
noverb:  Frank
noverb:  I
active:  one day father struck a rich pocket
active:  made a pile
active:  poor Frank here had a claim
active:  petered out
active:  came to nothing
active:  The richer Pa grew
active:  the poorer was Frank
noverb:  at last Pa wouldn't hear
active:  of our engagement lasting any longer
active:  he took me away to 'Frisco
noverb:  Frank wouldn't throw up his hand
noverb:  though
noverb:  he followed me there
active:  he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it
active:  It would only have made him mad
active:  to know
active:  we just fixed it all up for ourselves
active:  Frank said
active:  he would go and make his pile
noverb:  too
noverb:  never come back
active:  to claim me
active:  he had
noverb:  Pa
active:  I promised
active:  to wait for him to the end of time
active:  pledged myself not
active:  to marry anyone else
active:  he lived
noverb:  shouldn't we be married right away
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I will feel sure of you
noverb:  and I won't claim
active:  to be your husband
active:  I come back
noverb:  Well,
active:  we talked it over
active:  he had fixed it all up
noverb:  nicely
noverb:  with a clergyman all ready in waiting
noverb:  we just did it right there
active:  and then Frank went off
active:  to seek his fortune
active:  I went back to Pa
noverb:  The next
active:  I heard of Frank was
active:  he was in Montana
active:  he went
active:  prospecting in Arizona
active:  I heard of him from New Mexico
noverb:  After
active:  came a long newspaper story about
passive: a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians
active:  there was my Frank's name
noverb:  among the killed
active:  I fainted dead away
active:  I was very sick
noverb:  for months after
active:  Pa thought
active:  I had a decline
active:  took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco
active:  Not a word of news came for a year
active:  I never doubted
active:  Frank was really dead
active:  Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco
active:  we came to London
passive: a marriage was arranged
active:  Pa was very pleased
active:  I felt all the time
active:  no man on this earth would
noverb:  take the place in my heart
passive: had been given to my poor Frank
noverb:  Still,
active:  I had married Lord St. Simon
noverb:  of course I'd have done my duty by him
noverb:  We can't command our love
active:  we can our actions
active:  I went to the altar with him with the intention
active:  to make him just as good a wife
active:  it was in me
active:  to be
active:  you may imagine
active:  I felt
noverb:  just
active:  I came to the altar rails
active:  I glanced back
active:  saw Frank standing
active:  looking at me out of the first pew
active:  I thought
active:  it was his ghost
noverb:  at first
active:  I looked again there
active:  he was still
noverb:  , with a kind of question in his eyes
noverb:  as
active:  to ask me
active:  I were glad or sorry
active:  to see him
active:  I wonder I didn't drop
active:  I know
active:  everything was turning round
active:  the words of the clergyman were just
noverb:  the buzz of a bee in my ear
noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  Should I stop the service
active:  make a scene in the church
active:  I glanced at him again
active:  he seemed to know
active:  I was thinking
noverb:  for he raised his finger to his lips
active:  to tell me
active:  to be still
noverb:  Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was writing me a note
active:  As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him
active:  he slipped the note into my hand
noverb:  he returned me the flowers
active:  It was only a line
active:  asking me
active:  to join him
active:  he made the sign to me
active:  to do
noverb:  Of course I never doubted for a moment
active:  my first duty was now to him
active:  I determined to do just
active:  he might direct
active:  When I got back
active:  I told my maid
active:  had known him in California
active:  had always been his friend
active:  I ordered her
active:  to say nothing
active:  to get a few things
novoice: packed
noverb:  my ulster ready
active:  I know
active:  I ought
active:  to have spoken to Lord St. Simon
active:  it was dreadful
noverb:  hard
noverb:  his mother and all those great people
active:  I just made up my mind
active:  to run away
active:  explain afterwards
noverb:  I hadn't been at the table ten minutes
active:  I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road
active:  He beckoned to me
active:  began walking into the Park
active:  I slipped out
noverb:  put on my things
active:  followed him
active:  Some woman came talking something
noverb:  other about Lord St. Simon to me
novoice: seemed to me from the little
active:  I heard as
active:  he had a little secret of his own
noverb:  marriage also
active:  I managed
active:  to get away from her
active:  soon overtook Frank
active:  We got into a cab together
noverb:  away we drove to some lodgings
active:  he had taken in Gordon Square
noverb:  was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
active:  Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches
active:  had escaped
active:  came on to 'Frisco
active:  found
active:  I had given him up for dead
active:  had gone to England
noverb:  followed me there
active:  had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
active:  I saw it in a paper
active:  explained the American
active:  It gave the name
noverb:  the church
noverb:  not
active:  the lady lived
active:  we had a talk as to
active:  we should do
active:  Frank was all for openness
active:  I was so ashamed
noverb:  of it all
active:  I felt as
active:  I should like to vanish away
active:  never see any of them again
noverb:  just sending a line to Pa
noverb:  perhaps
active:  to show him
active:  I was alive
active:  It was awful
noverb:  to me
active:  to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round
noverb:  breakfast-table and waiting for me
active:  to come back
active:  So Frank took my wedding-clothes
noverb:  things
active:  made a bundle of them
passive: I should not be traced
active:  dropped them away somewhere
active:  no one could find them
active:  It is likely
active:  we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow
noverb:  only
active:  this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening
active:  he found
active:  us is more than
active:  I can think
active:  he showed us very clearly
noverb:  kindly
active:  I was wrong
noverb:  and
active:  Frank was right
active:  we should be putting ourselves in the wrong
active:  we were so secret
noverb:  he offered to give us a chance
active:  talking to Lord St. Simon alone
active:  we came right away round to his rooms at once
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Robert
active:  you have heard it all
active:  I am very sorry
noverb:  if I have given you pain
active:  I hope
active:  you do not think very meanly of me
active:  Lord St. Simon had
active:  by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
active:  had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
active:  Excuse me
active:  he said
active:  it is not my custom
active:  to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
noverb:  you won't forgive me
noverb:  You won't shake hands
active:  I go
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  it would give you any pleasure
active:  He put out his hand
novoice: coldly grasped
active:  she extended to him
active:  I had hoped
active:  suggested Holmes
active:  you would have joined us in a friendly supper
active:  I think
noverb:  there
active:  you ask a little too much
active:  responded his Lordship
passive: I may be forced
active:  to acquiesce in these recent developments
passive: I can hardly be expected
active:  to make merry over them
active:  I think
noverb:  with your permission
active:  I will
active:  now wish you all a very good-night
active:  He included us all in a sweeping bow
novoice: stalked out of the room
active:  I trust
active:  you at least will honour me with your company
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is always a joy
active:  to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for
active:  I am one of those
active:  believe
active:  the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
active:  being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
active:  shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
active:  The case has been an interesting one
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  our visitors had left us
noverb:  it serves
active:  to show very clearly
noverb:  simple the explanation may be of an affair
active:  at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable
active:  Nothing could be more natural
noverb:  the sequence of events
passive: narrated by this lady
noverb:  nothing stranger
noverb:  than the result
novoice: viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard
active:  You were not yourself at fault at all
noverb:  From the first
active:  two facts were very obvious to me
noverb:  the one
active:  the lady had been quite willing
active:  to undergo the wedding ceremony
noverb:  the other
active:  she had repented of
noverb:  it within a few minutes of returning home
active:  Obviously something had occurred during the morning
active:  to cause her
noverb:  to change her mind
active:  could that something be
active:  She could not have spoken to anyone
active:  she was out
noverb:  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
noverb:  Had she seen someone
active:  she had
active:  it must be someone
noverb:  from America
active:  she had spent
noverb:  short a time in this country
active:  she could hardly have allowed anyone
active:  to acquire
noverb:  deep an influence over her
active:  the mere sight of him would induce her
active:  to change her plans
noverb:  completely
active:  You see
active:  we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea
active:  she might have seen an American
active:  could
novoice: this American be
active:  should he possess
noverb:  much influence over her
active:  It might be a lover
active:  it might be a husband
noverb:  Her young womanhood had
active:  I knew
passive: been spent in rough scenes
noverb:  under strange conditions
active:  So far I had got
active:  I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative
active:  When he told us of a man in a pew
noverb:  of the change in the bride's manner
noverb:  of so transparent a device
active:  obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet
noverb:  of her resort to her confidential maid
noverb:  of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping
noverb:  in miners' parlance means taking possession of
active:  another person has a prior claim to
active:  the whole situation became absolutely clear
active:  She had gone off with a man
active:  the man was
noverb:  a lover
active:  was a previous husband
novoice: the chances being in favour of the latter
noverb:  And
noverb:  in the world did you find them
active:  It might have been difficult
noverb:  friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of
noverb:  he did not himself know
active:  The initials were, of course, of the highest importance
noverb:  more valuable still was it
active:  to know
noverb:  within a week
active:  he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels
active:  did you deduce the select
noverb:  By the select prices
active:  Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels
active:  There are not many
noverb:  in London
active:  charge at
noverb:  rate
noverb:  In the second one
active:  I visited in Northumberland Avenue
active:  I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton
noverb:  an American gentleman
active:  had left only the day before
active:  looking over the entries against him
active:  I came upon the very items
active:  I had seen in the duplicate bill
active:  His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square
active:  thither I travelled
novoice: being fortunate enough
active:  to find the loving couple at home
noverb:  I ventured to give them some paternal advice
active:  to point out to them
active:  it would be better
noverb:  in every way
noverb:  they should make their position a little clearer
noverb:  both to the general public
noverb:  to Lord St. Simon in particular
active:  I invited them
noverb:  to meet him here
noverb:  as you see
noverb:  I made him keep the appointment
noverb:  with no very good result
active:  I remarked
active:  His conduct was certainly not very gracious
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  perhaps you would not be very gracious
active:  , after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife
noverb:  of fortune
active:  I think
active:  we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
active:  thank our stars
active:  we are never likely
active:  to find ourselves in the same position
noverb:  Draw your chair up
noverb:  hand me my violin
active:  for the only problem we have still
active:  to solve
active:  is
noverb:  to
noverb:  away these bleak autumnal evenings
noverb:  XI
noverb:  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
noverb:  Holmes
active:  said I
active:  I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street
active:  here is a madman coming along
active:  It seems rather sad
active:  his relatives should allow him
active:  to come out alone
noverb:  My friend rose lazily from his armchair
novoice: stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown
noverb:  looking over my shoulder
active:  It was a bright, crisp February morning
noverb:  the snow of the day
noverb:  still lay deep upon the ground
noverb:  shimmering brightly in the wintry sun
passive: Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic
noverb:  at
noverb:  side
noverb:  on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay
active:  it fell
passive: The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped
active:  was still dangerously slippery
active:  there were fewer passengers
noverb:  usual
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
active:  eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
active:  He was a man
noverb:  of about fifty, tall, portly
noverb:  imposing
noverb:  with a massive
active:  strongly marked face and a commanding figure
passive: He was dressed in a sombre
noverb:  rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters
noverb:  well-cut pearl-grey trousers
active:  Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
noverb:  features
noverb:  for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
passive: is little accustomed
active:  to set any tax upon his legs
active:  he ran
active:  he jerked his hands up and down
active:  waggled his head
active:  writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
active:  on earth can be the matter with him
active:  I asked
active:  He is looking up at the numbers of the houses
active:  I believe
active:  he is coming here
active:  said Holmes
active:  rubbing his hands
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
active:  I rather think
active:  he is coming to consult me professionally
active:  I think
active:  I recognise the symptoms
noverb:  Ha! did I not tell you
noverb:  As he spoke
noverb:  the man
noverb:  puffing
noverb:  blowing
noverb:  rushed at our door
novoice: pulled
novoice: at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
noverb:  A few moments later he was in our room
noverb:  still puffing
noverb:  still gesticulating
noverb:  with
active:  fixed a look of grief
noverb:  despair in his eyes
active:  our smiles
passive: were turned in an instant to horror and pity
active:  For a while he could not get his words out
active:  swayed his body
novoice: plucked at his hair
noverb:  one
passive: has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason
active:  suddenly springing to his feet
active:  he beat his head against the wall with such force
noverb:  we
noverb:  rushed upon him
active:  tore him away to the centre of the room
active:  Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair
noverb:  sitting beside him
active:  patted his hand
novoice: chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones
active:  he knew
noverb:  well
active:  to employ
active:  You have come to me
active:  to tell your story
active:  have you not
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: You are fatigued with your haste
active:  Pray wait
active:  you have recovered yourself
active:  I shall be most happy
active:  to look into any little problem
active:  you may submit to me
noverb:  The man sat for a minute
noverb:  with a heaving chest
noverb:  fighting against his emotion
active:  he passed his handkerchief over his brow
noverb:  set his lips tight
active:  turned his face towards us
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you think me mad
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I see
active:  you have had some great trouble
active:  responded Holmes
active:  God knows
novoice: I have!
noverb:  a trouble
active:  is enough
active:  to unseat my reason
noverb:  sudden
noverb:  so terrible is it
noverb:  Public disgrace I might have faced
active:  I am a man
noverb:  whose character has never yet borne a stain
active:  Private affliction also is the lot of every man
active:  the two coming together
noverb:  in so frightful a form
active:  have been enough
active:  to shake my very soul
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is not I alone
active:  The very noblest in the land may suffer
passive: some way be found out of this horrible affair
active:  Pray
active:  compose yourself, sir
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  and let me have a clear account of
active:  you are
active:  it is
active:  has befallen you
noverb:  My name
active:  answered our visitor
active:  is probably familiar to your ears
active:  I am Alexander Holder
noverb:  ,
noverb:  of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson
noverb:  of Threadneedle Street
active:  The name was indeed well known to us
active:  belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London
active:  could have happened
active:  to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass
active:  We waited
noverb:  all curiosity
noverb:  until with another effort
active:  he braced himself
active:  to tell his story
active:  I feel
active:  time is of value
active:  said he
active:  that is
active:  I hastened here
active:  the police inspector suggested
active:  I should secure your co-operation
active:  I came to Baker Street by the Underground
active:  hurried from there on foot
active:  for the cabs go slowly through this snow
active:  That is
active:  I was
noverb:  out of breath
noverb:  for
active:  I am a man
noverb:  who takes very little exercise
active:  I feel better now
active:  I will put the facts
noverb:  you as shortly
noverb:  yet
active:  I can
active:  It is
noverb:  of course
active:  well known to
noverb:  you
noverb:  in a successful banking business
novoice: much depends upon our being able
active:  to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
noverb:  the number of our depositors
noverb:  One of our most lucrative means
active:  laying out
active:  money is in the shape of loans
active:  the security is unimpeachable
active:  We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years
active:  there are many noble families to
active:  we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures
noverb:  libraries
noverb:  plate
noverb:  Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank
passive: a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
active:  I started
active:  I saw the name
active:  for it was
noverb:  of none other than
noverb:  well
noverb:  perhaps even to you I had
active:  better say no more than
active:  it was a name
noverb:  which is a household word all over the earth
noverb:  one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England
passive: I was overwhelmed by the honour
noverb:  attempted
active:  he entered
active:  to say
active:  he plunged at once into business with the air of a man
active:  wishes
active:  to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: I have been informed
active:  you are in the habit of advancing money
active:  The firm does
active:  the security is good
active:  I answered
active:  It is absolutely essential
noverb:  to me
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I should have $50,000 at once
active:  I could, of course, borrow
noverb:  trifling a sum ten times over from my friends
noverb:  I much prefer to make it a matter of business
active:  to carry out
noverb:  business myself
noverb:  In my position
active:  you can readily understand
active:  it is unwise
active:  to place one's self under obligations
noverb:  For
noverb:  long
active:  may I ask
active:  do you want this sum
active:  I asked
active:  Next Monday I have a large sum due to me
active:  I shall
active:  most certainly repay
noverb:  you advance
noverb:  with
active:  interest
active:  you think it right
active:  to charge
active:  it is very essential
noverb:  to me
passive: the money should be paid at once
active:  I should be happy
active:  to advance it without further parley from my own private purse
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  were it not
active:  the strain would be rather more than
active:  it could bear
active:  , on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm
active:  in justice to my partner I must insist
noverb:  even in your case
passive: every businesslike precaution should be taken
noverb:  I should much prefer to have it
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  raising up a square, black morocco case
active:  he had laid beside his chair
active:  You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
noverb:  One of the most precious public possessions of the empire
active:  said I.
noverb:  Precisely
active:  He opened the case
noverb:  there
passive: imbedded in soft
noverb:  flesh-coloured velvet
noverb:  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
active:  he had named
active:  There are thirty-nine enormous beryls
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the price of the gold chasing
active:  is incalculable
active:  The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum
active:  I have asked
passive: I am prepared
active:  to leave it with you as my security
active:  I took the precious case into my hands
novoice: looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
active:  You doubt its value
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  I only doubt
noverb:  The propriety of my leaving it
active:  You may set your mind at rest about that
active:  I should not dream
active:  doing
active:  so were it not absolutely certain
noverb:  that I should be able
noverb:  in four days
active:  to reclaim it
active:  It is a pure matter of form
active:  Is the security sufficient
noverb:  Ample
active:  You understand
noverb:  Mr. Holder
noverb:  I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence
active:  I have in
noverb:  you
noverb:  founded upon all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you
active:  I rely upon
noverb:  you not only
active:  to be discreet
active:  to refrain from all gossip upon the matter
noverb:  above all
active:  to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution
active:  I need
active:  not say
passive: a great public scandal would be caused
active:  any harm were to befall it
active:  Any injury to it would be almost
noverb:  its complete loss
active:  for there are no beryls
noverb:  in the world
active:  to match these
active:  it would be impossible
active:  to replace them
active:  I leave it with you
noverb:  however, with every confidence,
active:  I shall call for
noverb:  it in person on Monday morning
active:  Seeing
active:  my client was anxious
active:  to leave
active:  I said no
active:  calling for my cashier
active:  I ordered him
active:  to pay over fifty $1000 notes
active:  When I was alone once
noverb:  however
noverb:  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me
active:  I could not
noverb:  think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
novoice: it entailed upon me
active:  There could be no doubt
noverb:  that
active:  it was a national possession
active:  a horrible scandal would ensue
active:  any misfortune should occur to
noverb:  it
noverb:  I
novoice: already regretted
active:  having ever consented to take charge of it
noverb:  However,
active:  it was too late
active:  to alter the matter now
active:  I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
noverb:  to my work
active:  When evening came
active:  I felt
active:  it would be an imprudence
active:  to leave
noverb:  precious a thing in the office behind me
passive: Bankers' safes had been forced
noverb:  now
active:  should not mine
active:  be
noverb:  terrible would be the position in
active:  I should find myself
active:  I determined
noverb:  therefore
noverb:  for the next few days
active:  I would always carry the case backward
noverb:  forward with me
active:  it might never be really out of my reach
noverb:  With this intention
active:  I called a cab
active:  drove out to my house at Streatham
active:  carrying the jewel with me
active:  I did not breathe freely
active:  I had taken it upstairs
active:  locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
noverb:  And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you
active:  to thoroughly understand the situation
noverb:  My groom
noverb:  my page sleep out of the house
passive: may be set aside altogether
active:  I have three maid-servants
active:  have been with me a number of years
active:  absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
noverb:  Another
noverb:  Lucy Parr
noverb:  the second waiting-maid
active:  has only been in my service a few months
active:  She came with an excellent character
noverb:  however
noverb:  has always given me satisfaction
active:  She is a very pretty girl
active:  has attracted admirers
active:  have occasionally hung about the place
active:  That is the only drawback
active:  we have found to her
active:  we believe her
active:  to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
noverb:  much for the servants
noverb:  My family
active:  itself is so small
noverb:  that it will not take me long
active:  to describe it
active:  I am a widower
active:  have an only son, Arthur
active:  He has been a disappointment to me
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  a grievous disappointment
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am myself
active:  to blame
active:  People tell me
active:  I have spoiled him
noverb:  Very likely I have
active:  When my dear wife died
active:  I felt
active:  he was all
active:  I had
active:  to love
active:  I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
noverb:  I have never denied him a wish
active:  Perhaps it would
active:  have been better for
novoice: of us had
novoice: I been sterner
active:  I meant it for the best
active:  It was naturally my intention
noverb:  that he should succeed me in my business
active:  he was not of a business turn
active:  He was wild
noverb:  wayward
active:  to speak the truth
active:  I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
noverb:  When
active:  he was young
active:  he became a member of an aristocratic club
noverb:  there
active:  having charming manners
active:  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
active:  He learned
active:  to play heavily at cards
active:  to squander money on the turf
active:  he had again
noverb:  again
active:  to come to me
active:  implore me
noverb:  to give him an advance upon his allowance
active:  he might settle his debts of honour
active:  He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company
active:  he was keeping
noverb:  each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough
active:  to draw him back again
noverb:  And,
noverb:  indeed
active:  I could not wonder
noverb:  such a man
active:  Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him
noverb:  for he has frequently brought him to my house
active:  I have found myself
active:  I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
active:  He is older
noverb:  than Arthur
noverb:  a man of the world to his finger-tips
noverb:  one
active:  had been everywhere
noverb:  seen everything
noverb:  a brilliant talker
noverb:  a man of great personal beauty
noverb:  Yet when I think of him in cold blood
noverb:  far away from the glamour of his presence
passive: I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look
active:  I have caught in his eyes
active:  he is one
noverb:  who should be deeply distrusted
active:  So I think
noverb:  too
active:  thinks my little Mary
active:  has a woman's quick insight into character
active:  And now there is only she
passive: to be described
active:  She is my niece
active:  my brother died five years ago
active:  left her alone in the world
active:  I adopted her
active:  have looked upon her
noverb:  as my daughter
active:  She is a sunbeam
noverb:  in my house
noverb:  sweet
noverb:  loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager
noverb:  housekeeper
noverb:  yet as tender
noverb:  quiet
noverb:  gentle as a woman could be
noverb:  She is my right hand
active:  I do not know
active:  I could do without her
active:  In only one matter has she
noverb:  gone against my wishes
active:  Twice my boy has asked her
active:  to marry him
noverb:  for he loves her devotedly
noverb:  each time
active:  she has refused him
active:  I think
active:  anyone could have drawn him into the right path
active:  it would have been she
active:  his marriage might have changed his whole life
noverb:  now
noverb:  alas!
active:  it is too late
noverb:  --forever too late
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you know the people
active:  live under my roof
active:  I shall continue with my miserable story
active:  When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
noverb:  night after dinner
active:  I told Arthur
noverb:  Mary my experience
noverb:  of the precious treasure
active:  we had under our roof
active:  suppressing only the name of my client
noverb:  Lucy Parr
active:  had brought in the coffee
active:  had
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , left the room
active:  I cannot swear
passive: the door was closed
noverb:  Mary
passive: Arthur were much interested and wished
active:  to see the famous coronet
active:  I thought it better not
active:  to disturb it
passive: Where have
active:  you put it
active:  asked Arthur
noverb:  In my own bureau
noverb:  Well,
active:  I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: It is locked up
active:  I answered
noverb:  Oh
active:  any old key will fit that bureau
active:  When I was a youngster
noverb:  I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
active:  He often had a wild way of talking
active:  I thought little of
active:  he said
active:  He followed me to my room
noverb:  however
noverb:  night with a very grave face
noverb:  Look here, dad
active:  said
active:  he with his eyes cast down
noverb:  can you let me have $200
noverb:  No
active:  I cannot
active:  I answered sharply
active:  I have been far too generous with you in money matters
active:  You have been very kind
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I must have this money
active:  else I can never show my face inside the club again
noverb:  And a very good thing
noverb:  too
active:  I cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not bear the disgrace
active:  I must raise the money in some way
noverb:  you will not let me have it
active:  I must try other means
active:  I was very angry
noverb:  , for this was the third demand during the month
active:  You shall not have a farthing from me
active:  I cried
noverb:  on
active:  he bowed and left the room without another word
passive: When he was gone
active:  I unlocked my bureau
noverb:  made sure
active:  my treasure was safe
active:  locked it again
active:  Then I started
active:  to go round the house
active:  to see
noverb:  all was secure
noverb:  a duty
active:  I usually leave to Mary
active:  I thought it well
noverb:  to perform myself that night
active:  As I came down the stairs
noverb:  I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall
active:  she closed and fastened
active:  I approached
noverb:  Tell me, dad,' said
noverb:  she
noverb:  looking
active:  I thought
noverb:  a little disturbed
active:  did you give Lucy
noverb:  the maid
noverb:  leave
active:  to go out to-night?
noverb:  Certainly not
active:  She came in just now by the back door
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she has only been to the side gate
active:  to see someone
active:  I think
active:  it is hardly safe
noverb:  and should be stopped
active:  You must speak to her in the morning
active:  I will
active:  you prefer it
active:  Are you sure
passive: everything is fastened
noverb:  Quite sure
noverb:  dad
noverb:  good-night
active:  I kissed her
active:  went up to my bedroom again
active:  I was soon asleep
noverb:  I am endeavouring to tell you everything
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  may have any bearing upon the case
active:  I beg
active:  you will question me upon any point
active:  I do not make clear
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  your statement is singularly lucid
active:  I come to a part of my story now in
active:  I should wish to be particularly
active:  I am not a very heavy sleeper
novoice: the anxiety in my mind tended
noverb:  no doubt
active:  to make me even
noverb:  usual
noverb:  About two in the morning
passive: I was awakened by some sound in the house
active:  It had ceased ere
novoice: I was wide
noverb:  awake
active:  it had left an impression behind it as
active:  a window had gently closed somewhere
active:  I lay listening with all my ears
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my horror
active:  there was a distinct sound of footsteps
active:  moving softly in the next room
active:  I slipped out of bed
noverb:  all palpitating with fear
active:  peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
noverb:  Arthur
active:  I screamed
noverb:  you villain! you thief
active:  dare
active:  you touch that coronet
active:  The gas was half up
active:  I had left it
noverb:  my unhappy boy
passive: dressed only in his shirt
noverb:  trousers
active:  was standing beside the light
noverb:  holding the coronet in his hands
active:  He appeared
active:  to be wrenching at
noverb:  it
active:  bending it with all his strength
active:  At my cry he dropped it from his grasp
active:  turned
noverb:  death
active:  I snatched it up
active:  examined it
noverb:  One of the gold corners
noverb:  with three of the beryls in it
active:  was missing
active:  You blackguard
active:  I shouted
noverb:  beside myself with rage
active:  You have destroyed it
noverb:  You have dishonoured me forever
active:  Where are the jewels
active:  you have stolen
noverb:  Stolen
active:  he cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  thief
active:  I roared
active:  shaking him by the shoulder
active:  There are none
active:  missing
active:  There cannot be any missing
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  There are three
noverb:  missing
active:  And you know
active:  they are
noverb:  Must I call you a liar
noverb:  a thief
active:  Did I not see
active:  you trying to tear off another piece
active:  You have called me names enough
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I will not stand it any longer
active:  I shall not say another word about this business
active:  you have chosen to insult me
active:  I will leave your house in the morning
noverb:  make my own way in the world
active:  You shall leave it in the hands of the police
active:  I cried half-mad with grief and rage
active:  I shall have this matter
novoice: probed to the bottom
active:  You shall learn nothing from me
active:  said
noverb:  he with a passion such as I should not have thought
active:  was in his nature
active:  you choose to call the police
active:  let the police
active:  find
active:  they can
active:  By this time the whole house was astir
noverb:  for I had raised my voice in my anger
active:  Mary was the first
active:  to rush into my room
noverb:  at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face
active:  she read the whole story
noverb:  , with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground
active:  I sent the house-maid for the police
active:  put the investigation into their hands at once
noverb:  When the inspector
active:  a constable entered the house, Arthur
novoice: had stood sullenly with his arms folded
active:  asked me
active:  it was my intention
active:  to charge him with theft
active:  I answered
active:  it had ceased to be a private matter
noverb:  had become a public one
active:  the ruined coronet was national property
active:  I was determined
active:  the law should have its way in everything
noverb:  At least,
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you will not have me arrested at once
active:  It would be to your advantage
noverb:  mine
active:  I might leave the house for five minutes
active:  you may get away
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you may conceal
active:  you have stolen
active:  said I. And
active:  realising the dreadful position in
passive: I was placed
active:  I implored him
active:  to remember
noverb:  not only my honour
noverb:  of one
noverb:  who was far greater
noverb:  than I was at stake
noverb:  and
active:  he threatened to raise a scandal
active:  would convulse the nation
active:  He might avert it all
active:  he would
active:  tell me
active:  he had done with the three missing stones
active:  You may as well face the matter
active:  said
noverb:  I
passive: you have been caught in the act
active:  no confession could make your guilt more heinous
noverb:  you
noverb:  make such reparation
active:  is in your power
active:  telling us
active:  the beryls are
noverb:  all shall be forgiven and forgotten
noverb:  Keep your forgiveness for those
active:  ask for it
active:  he answered
noverb:  turning away from me with a sneer
active:  I saw
active:  he was too hardened
noverb:  for any words of mine
active:  to influence him
active:  There was
noverb:  one way for it
active:  I called in the inspector
active:  gave him into custody
passive: A search was made at once not only of his person
noverb:  of his room
noverb:  of every portion of the house
active:  he could possibly have concealed the gems
passive: no trace of them could be found
noverb:  would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats
noverb:  This morning
passive: he was removed to a cell
noverb:  I
active:  going through all the police formalities
active:  have hurried round to you
active:  to implore you
active:  to use your skill
active:  unravelling the matter
active:  The police have openly confessed
active:  they can at present make nothing of it
active:  You may go to any expense
active:  you think necessary
active:  I have already offered a reward of $1000
noverb:  My God
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night
noverb:  Oh
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  He put a hand on
noverb:  side of his head
active:  rocked himself to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  droning to himself
noverb:  a child
active:  grief has got beyond words
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes
noverb:  , with his brows knitted
active:  his eyes fixed upon the fire
active:  Do you receive much company
active:  he asked
active:  None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's
active:  Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately
noverb:  No one else
active:  I think
active:  Do you go out much in society
active:  Arthur does
noverb:  Mary
active:  I stay at home
noverb:  We
noverb:  of us care for it
active:  That is unusual in a young girl
active:  She is of a quiet nature
noverb:  Besides
active:  she is not
noverb:  very young
active:  She is four-and
noverb:  -twenty
noverb:  This matter
noverb:  from
active:  you say
active:  seems to have been a shock to her also
noverb:  Terrible
active:  She is even more affected
noverb:  than I.
active:  You have
noverb:  of you any doubt as to your son's guilt
active:  can we have
active:  I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
active:  I hardly consider
noverb:  a conclusive proof
active:  Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was twisted
active:  Do you not think
active:  he might have been trying to straighten it
active:  God bless you
active:  You are doing
active:  you can for him
noverb:  for me
active:  it is too heavy
noverb:  a task
active:  was he doing there at all
active:  his purpose were innocent
active:  did he not say
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And
active:  it were guilty
noverb:  ,
active:  did he not invent a lie
active:  His silence appears to me
active:  to cut
noverb:  ways
active:  There are several singular points about the case
active:  did the police think of the noise
active:  awoke you from your sleep
active:  They considered
passive: it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door
noverb:  A likely story
noverb:  As
passive: a man bent
active:  on felony would slam his door
active:  to wake a household
active:  did they say
noverb:  of the disappearance of these gems
active:  They are still sounding the planking
active:  probing the furniture in the hope
active:  finding them
noverb:  Have they thought
active:  looking outside the house
noverb:  Yes
active:  they have shown extraordinary energy
passive: The whole garden has already been minutely examined
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  said Holmes
active:  is it not obvious
noverb:  to you now
active:  this matter really strikes very much deeper
noverb:  you
active:  the police were at first inclined to think
novoice: It appeared to
noverb:  you
active:  to be a simple case
active:  to me it seems exceedingly complex
active:  Consider
passive: is involved by your theory
active:  You suppose
active:  your son came down from his bed
active:  went, at great risk, to your dressing-room
noverb:  opened your bureau
active:  took out your coronet
active:  broke off by main force a small portion of it
active:  went off to some other place
active:  concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine
noverb:  with such skill
active:  nobody can find them
novoice: returned with the other thirty-six into the room in
active:  he exposed himself to the greatest danger
passive: being discovered
active:  I ask you now
active:  is such a theory tenable
noverb:  other is there
active:  cried the banker with a gesture of despair
active:  his motives were innocent
active:  does he not explain them
active:  It is our task
active:  to find
noverb:  out
active:  replied Holmes
noverb:  now
noverb:  you
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  we will set off for Streatham together
active:  devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
active:  My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
active:  I was eager enough
active:  to do
passive: for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to
active:  we had listened
active:  I confess
active:  the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me
active:  to be
active:  it did to his unhappy father
active:  still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment
active:  I felt
active:  there must be some grounds
noverb:  for hope
passive: he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation
noverb:  He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb
active:  sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes
active:  sunk in the deepest thought
active:  Our client appeared
active:  to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
passive: had been presented to him
active:  he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs
noverb:  A short railway journey
active:  a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank
noverb:  the modest residence of the great financier
active:  Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone
noverb:  standing back a little from the road
noverb:  A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
noverb:  stretched down in front to two large iron gates
active:  closed the entrance
active:  On the right side was a small wooden thicket
active:  led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door
active:  forming the tradesmen's entrance
active:  On the left ran a lane
active:  led to the stables
active:  was not itself within the grounds at all
novoice: being a public
noverb:  little used
noverb:  thoroughfare
noverb:  Holmes left us standing at the door
active:  walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path
noverb:  round by the garden behind into the stable lane
active:  long was he
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I went into the dining-room
active:  waited by the fire
active:  he should return
active:  We were sitting there in silence
active:  the door opened
active:  a young lady came in
active:  She was rather above the middle height
noverb:  slim
noverb:  with dark hair
noverb:  eyes
active:  seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face
noverb:  Her lips
noverb:  too
active:  were bloodless
passive: her eyes were flushed with crying
noverb:  As she swept silently into the room
active:  she impressed me with a greater sense of grief
active:  the banker had done in the morning
active:  it was the
noverb:  more striking in her
active:  she was evidently a woman of strong character
noverb:  with immense capacity for self-restraint
active:  Disregarding my presence
active:  she went straight to her uncle
active:  passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
active:  You have given orders
passive: Arthur should be liberated
active:  have you not
noverb:  dad
active:  she asked
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  my girl
passive: the matter must be probed to the bottom
active:  I am so sure
noverb:  that he is innocent
active:  You know
active:  woman's instincts are
active:  I know
active:  he has done no harm
active:  you will be sorry
noverb:  for having acted
noverb:  harshly
active:  is he silent
active:  he is innocent
active:  knows
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  he was so angry
noverb:  that you should suspect him
active:  could I help
active:  suspecting him
active:  I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
noverb:  Oh
active:  he had only picked it up
active:  to look at it
noverb:  Oh
active:  do
active:  do take my word for it
active:  he is innocent
active:  Let the matter drop
active:  say no
active:  It is so dreadful
active:  to think of our dear Arthur in prison
active:  I shall never let
active:  it drop
passive: until the gems are found
noverb:  never
noverb:  Mary
active:  Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me
noverb:  Far
active:  hushing the thing up
active:  I have brought a gentleman down from London
active:  to inquire more deeply into it
noverb:  This gentleman
active:  she asked
noverb:  facing round to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  his friend
active:  He wished us
active:  to leave him alone
active:  He is round
noverb:  in the stable lane now
noverb:  The stable lane
noverb:  She raised her dark eyebrows
active:  can he hope to find there
noverb:  Ah! this
active:  I suppose
active:  is he
active:  I trust
noverb:  sir
active:  you will succeed in proving
active:  I feel sure
active:  is the truth
active:  my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime
active:  I fully share your opinion
active:  I trust
noverb:  with you
active:  we may prove it
active:  returned Holmes
noverb:  going back to the mat
active:  to knock the snow from his shoes
active:  I believe
active:  I have the honour
active:  addressing Miss Mary Holder
noverb:  Might I ask you a question or two
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  sir
active:  it may help to clear this horrible affair up
noverb:  You heard nothing yourself last night
noverb:  Nothing
active:  until my uncle here began to speak loudly
active:  I heard
active:  I came down
active:  You shut up the windows
noverb:  doors the night before
active:  Did you fasten all the windows
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Were they all fastened this morning
noverb:  Yes
active:  You have a maid
active:  has a sweetheart
active:  I think
active:  you remarked to your uncle last night
active:  she had been out
active:  to see him
noverb:  Yes
active:  she was the girl
noverb:  who waited in the drawing-room
active:  may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet
active:  I see
active:  You infer
active:  she may have gone out
active:  to tell her sweetheart
active:  the two may have planned the robbery
active:  is the good of all these vague theories
active:  cried the banker impatiently
active:  when I have told you
active:  I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands
active:  Wait a little, Mr. Holder
active:  We must come back to that
noverb:  About this girl
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  You saw her return by the kitchen door
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
active:  when I went
active:  to see
passive: the door was fastened for the night
active:  I met her slipping in
active:  I saw the man
noverb:  too
noverb:  in the gloom
active:  Do you know him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes!
active:  he is the green-grocer
active:  brings our vegetables round
active:  His name is Francis Prosper
active:  He stood
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  to the left of the door
active:  that is to say
noverb:  farther up the path
active:  is necessary
active:  to reach the door
noverb:  Yes
active:  he did
noverb:  And
active:  he is a man
noverb:  with a wooden leg
active:  Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes
active:  you are
noverb:  a magician
active:  said she
active:  do you know that
active:  She smiled
active:  there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin
noverb:  eager face
active:  I should be very glad now
active:  to go upstairs
active:  said he
active:  I shall probably wish
active:  to go over the
noverb:  of the house again
active:  Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows
active:  I go up
active:  He walked swiftly round from one to the other
active:  pausing only at the large one
active:  looked from the hall onto the stable lane
noverb:  This
active:  he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens
active:  Now we shall go upstairs
active:  said he at last
active:  The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber
noverb:  with a grey carpet
noverb:  a large bureau
noverb:  a long mirror
active:  Holmes went to the bureau first
active:  looked hard at the lock
passive: key was used
active:  to open it
active:  he asked
noverb:  my son
active:  himself indicated
noverb:  of the cupboard of the lumber-room
noverb:  Have you it here
active:  That is it on the dressing-table
active:  Sherlock Holmes took it up
active:  opened the bureau
active:  It is a noiseless lock
active:  said he
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that it did not wake you
noverb:  This case
active:  I presume
active:  contains the coronet
active:  We must have a look at it
active:  He opened the case
active:  taking out the diadem
active:  he laid it upon the table
active:  It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art
active:  the thirty-six stones were the finest
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
active:  a corner holding three gems
passive: had been torn away
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Holmes
active:  here is the corner
active:  corresponds to
novoice: has been
noverb:  unfortunately lost
active:  Might I beg
active:  you will break it off
active:  The banker recoiled in horror
active:  I should not dream of trying
active:  said he
active:  I will
active:  Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it
noverb:  without result
active:  I feel
active:  it give a little
active:  said he
active:  I am exceptionally strong
noverb:  in the fingers
noverb:  it would take me all my time
active:  to break it
active:  An ordinary man could not do it
noverb:  Now,
active:  do you
active:  think would happen
active:  I did break it, Mr. Holder
active:  There would be a noise
noverb:  like a pistol shot
active:  Do you tell me
noverb:  all this happened within a few yards of your bed
active:  you heard nothing of it
active:  I do not know
active:  to think
active:  It is all dark to me
active:  perhaps it may grow lighter
active:  we go
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  I confess
noverb:  I still share my uncle's perplexity
active:  Your son had no shoes or slippers on
active:  you saw him
noverb:  He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
active:  Thank you
passive: We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry
active:  it will be entirely our own fault
active:  we do not succeed
active:  clearing the matter up
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I shall
active:  now continue my investigations
active:  He went alone, at his own request, for he explained
active:  any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
noverb:  For an hour
active:  he was at work
active:  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features
active:  I think
active:  I have seen now all
active:  there is
active:  to see
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said he
noverb:  I can serve you best
active:  returning to my rooms
noverb:  the gems, Mr. Holmes
active:  Where are they
active:  I cannot tell
active:  The banker wrung his hands
active:  I shall never see them again
active:  he cried
noverb:  And my son
noverb:  You give me hopes
active:  My opinion is in no way altered
noverb:  , for God's sake,
active:  was this dark business
active:  was acted in my house last night
active:  you can call
active:  upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine
noverb:  ten
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to do
active:  I can to make it clearer
active:  I understand
active:  you give me carte blanche
active:  to act for
noverb:  you
novoice: provided only
active:  I get back the gems
active:  you place no limit on the sum
active:  I may draw
active:  I would give my fortune
noverb:  to have them back
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall look into the matter between this
noverb:  Good-bye;
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that I may have
active:  to come over here again
noverb:  evening
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  my companion's mind was
novoice: now made up about the case
active:  his conclusions were
active:  was more than
active:  I could even dimly imagine
noverb:  Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point
novoice: he always glided away to some other topic
noverb:  until at last I gave it over in despair
active:  It was not
noverb:  three
active:  we found ourselves in our rooms once
active:  He hurried to his chamber
novoice: was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
novoice: With his collar turned up
noverb:  his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots
active:  he was a perfect sample of the class
active:  I think
active:  this should do
active:  said he
active:  glancing into the glass above the fireplace
active:  I only wish
active:  you could come with me
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
noverb:  it won't do
active:  I may be on the trail in this matter
active:  I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp
active:  I shall soon know
active:  it is
active:  I hope
active:  I may be back
noverb:  in a few hours
active:  He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
active:  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread
active:  thrusting this rude meal into his pocket
active:  he started off upon his expedition
active:  I had just finished my tea
active:  he returned
noverb:  evidently in excellent spirits
active:  swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand
active:  He chucked it down into a corner
active:  helped himself to a cup of tea
novoice: I only looked in
active:  I passed
active:  said he
active:  I am going right on
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  to the other side of the West End
active:  It may be some time
active:  I get back
noverb:  Don't wait up for me in case
active:  I should be late
active:  are you getting on
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
active:  I have been out to Streatham
active:  I saw
active:  you last
active:  I did not call at the house
active:  It is a very sweet little problem
active:  I would not have missed it for a good deal
noverb:  However,
active:  I must not sit gossiping here
active:  must get these disreputable clothes off
noverb:  return to my highly respectable self
active:  I could see by his manner
active:  he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
active:  his words alone would imply
active:  His eyes twinkled
active:  there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks
active:  He hastened upstairs
noverb:  a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door
active:  told me
active:  he was off once
noverb:  upon his congenial hunt
active:  I waited until midnight
active:  there was no sign of his return
active:  I retired to my room
active:  It was no uncommon thing
noverb:  for him
active:  to be away for days
noverb:  nights on end
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon a scent
noverb:  his lateness caused me no surprise
active:  I do not know at
noverb:  hour he came in
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning there
active:  he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other
noverb:  as fresh
noverb:  trim as possible
active:  You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson
active:  said he
active:  you remember
active:  our client has rather an early appointment this morning
active:  it is after nine now
active:  I answered
passive: I should not be surprised
active:  were he
active:  I thought
active:  I heard a ring
active:  It was
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  our friend the financier
passive: I was shocked by the change
active:  had come over him
noverb:  for his face
active:  was naturally of a broad
noverb:  massive mould
active:  was now pinched
active:  fallen in
active:  his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter
active:  He entered with a weariness and lethargy
active:  was even more painful
noverb:  his violence of the morning before
active:  he dropped heavily into the armchair
active:  I pushed forward for him
active:  I do not know
active:  I have done to be
noverb:  severely tried
active:  said he
noverb:  Only two days ago
active:  I was a happy and prosperous man
noverb:  without a care in the world
passive: Now I am left to a lonely
active:  dishonoured age
active:  One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another
active:  My niece, Mary, has deserted me
active:  Deserted you
noverb:  Yes
passive: Her bed this morning had not been slept in
active:  her room was empty
noverb:  a note for me lay upon the hall table
active:  I had said to her last night
noverb:  in sorrow and not in anger
active:  she had married my boy all might
passive: have been well with him
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  it was thoughtless
noverb:  of me
active:  to say
active:  It is to
active:  remark
active:  she refers in this note
noverb:  MY DEAREST UNCLE
active:  I feel
active:  I have brought trouble upon you
active:  I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
active:  might never have occurred
active:  I cannot
noverb:  with this thought in my mind
active:  again be happy under your roof
active:  I feel
noverb:  I must leave you forever
active:  Do not worry about my future
noverb:  for
passive: is provided for
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  do not search for me
active:  for it will be fruitless labour
noverb:  an ill-service to me
noverb:  In life or in death
active:  I am
noverb:  your loving
noverb:  MARY
active:  could she mean by
noverb:  note
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Do you think
active:  it points to suicide
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  nothing of the kind
active:  It is perhaps the best possible solution
active:  I trust
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  you are nearing the end of your troubles
noverb:  Ha
active:  You say
active:  You have heard something
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have learned something
active:  Where are the gems
noverb:  You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them
active:  I would pay ten
active:  That would be unnecessary
active:  Three thousand will cover the matter
noverb:  And
active:  there is a little reward
active:  I fancy
active:  Have you your check-book? Here is a pen
noverb:  Better make it out for $4000
active:  With a dazed face the banker made out the required check
novoice: Holmes walked over to his desk
active:  took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it
active:  threw it down upon the table
active:  With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
active:  You have it
active:  he gasped
passive: I am saved
passive: I am saved
active:  The reaction of joy was
novoice: his grief had been
active:  he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
active:  There is one other thing
active:  you owe
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly
active:  Owe
active:  He caught up a pen
active:  Name the sum
active:  I will pay it
noverb:  No
active:  the debt is not to me
active:  You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son,
active:  has carried himself in this matter as
active:  I should be proud
active:  to see my own son
active:  do
active:  should I ever chance to have one
active:  it was not Arthur
noverb:  who took them
noverb:  I told you yesterday
noverb:  I repeat to-day
noverb:  ,
active:  it was not
active:  You are sure
noverb:  of it
noverb:  let us hurry to him at once
noverb:  to let him know
passive: the truth is known
active:  He knows it already
active:  When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him
active:  finding
noverb:  he would not tell me the story
active:  I told it to him
noverb:  on
active:  he had
active:  to confess
active:  I was right
noverb:  and
active:  to add the very few details
active:  were not
noverb:  quite clear to me
noverb:  Your news of this morning
noverb:  however
active:  may open his lips
noverb:  For heaven's sake
active:  tell me
active:  is this extraordinary mystery
active:  I will do
noverb:  I will show you the steps by
active:  I reached it
noverb:  And let me say to
noverb:  you
noverb:  first
active:  it is hardest
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
noverb:  for you
active:  to hear
active:  there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary
active:  They have
novoice: now fled together
noverb:  My Mary
noverb:  Impossible
active:  It is unfortunately more than possible
active:  it is certain
noverb:  Neither you
active:  your son knew the true character of this man
active:  you admitted him into your family circle
active:  He is one
noverb:  of the most dangerous men in England
noverb:  a ruined gambler
noverb:  an absolutely desperate villain
noverb:  a man without heart or conscience
active:  Your niece knew nothing of such men
active:  When he breathed his vows to her
active:  he had done to a hundred
noverb:  her
active:  she flattered herself
active:  she alone had touched his heart
active:  The devil knows best
active:  he said
active:  at least she became his tool
active:  was in the habit
noverb:  seeing him nearly every evening
active:  I cannot
active:  I will not
active:  believe it
active:  cried the banker with an ashen face
active:  I will tell you
active:  occurred in your house last night

active:  His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news
active:  he bent her to his will
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she loved you
active:  there are women
noverb:  in
active:  the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves
active:  I think
active:  she must have been one
active:  She had hardly listened to his instructions
active:  she saw you coming downstairs
noverb:  on
active:  she closed the window rapidly
noverb:  told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover
active:  was all perfectly true
active:  Your boy, Arthur, went
active:  to bed after his interview with you
active:  he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
noverb:  In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door
active:  he rose
active:  looking out
passive: was surprised
active:  to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage
active:  she disappeared into your dressing-room
passive: Petrified with astonishment
novoice: the lad slipped on some clothes
active:  waited there in the dark
active:  to see
active:  would come of this strange affair
active:  Presently she emerged from the room again
noverb:  in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
active:  she carried the precious coronet in her hands
active:  She passed down the stairs
noverb:  he
active:  thrilling with horror
active:  ran along
active:  slipped behind the curtain near your door
active:  whence he could see
novoice: passed in the hall beneath
noverb:  He saw her stealthily open the window
active:  hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom
active:  closing it once
noverb:  hurry back to her room
noverb:  passing quite close to
active:  he stood
novoice: hid behind the curtain
active:  she was on the scene
active:  he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman
active:  he loved
noverb:  the instant
passive: she was gone
active:  he realised
active:  crushing a misfortune
active:  this would be for
noverb:  you
noverb:  all-important it was to set it right
active:  He rushed down
noverb:  just
active:  he was, in his bare feet, opened
noverb:  the window
active:  sprang out into the snow
active:  ran down the lane
active:  he could see a dark figure in the moonlight
active:  Sir George Burnwell tried
active:  to get away
novoice: Arthur caught him
active:  there was a struggle
noverb:  between them
active:  your lad tugging at one side of the coronet
noverb:  his opponent at the other
noverb:  In the scuffle
active:  your son struck Sir George
novoice: cut him over the eye
active:  something suddenly snapped
noverb:  your son
active:  finding
active:  he had the coronet in his hands
noverb:  rushed back
active:  closed the window
novoice: ascended to your room
active:  had just observed
passive: the coronet had been twisted in the struggle
active:  was endeavouring to straighten it
active:  you appeared upon the scene
noverb:  Is it possible
active:  gasped the banker
noverb:  You
active:  roused his anger
active:  calling him names at a moment
active:  he felt
active:  he had deserved your warmest thanks
active:  He could not explain the true state of affairs
active:  betraying one
noverb:  certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands
active:  He took the more chivalrous view
noverb:  however
noverb:  preserved her secret
noverb:  And
active:  was
active:  she shrieked and fainted
active:  she saw the coronet
active:  cried Mr. Holder
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  my God!
noverb:  a blind fool I have been
active:  And his asking
passive: to be allowed
active:  to go out for five minutes
active:  The dear fellow wanted
active:  to see
active:  the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle
active:  cruelly I have misjudged him
active:  When I arrived at the house
active:  continued Holmes
noverb:  I at once went very carefully round it
active:  to observe
active:  there were any traces
noverb:  in the snow
active:  might help me
active:  I knew
active:  none had fallen
noverb:  the evening before
noverb:  also
active:  there had been a strong frost
active:  to preserve impressions
active:  I passed along the tradesmen's path
noverb:  found it all trampled down
noverb:  indistinguishable
noverb:  Just beyond it
active:  however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man
active:  round impressions on one side showed
active:  he had a wooden leg
active:  I could even tell
passive: they had been disturbed
active:  for the woman had run back swiftly to the door
passive: was shown by the deep toe
noverb:  light heel marks
active:  Wooden-leg had waited a little
active:  had gone away
active:  I thought at the time
active:  this might be the maid and her sweetheart
noverb:  of
active:  you had already spoken to me
active:  inquiry showed
active:  it was
active:  I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
active:  I took to be the police
active:  I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story
passive: was written in the snow in front of me
active:  There was a double line of tracks of a booted man
noverb:  a second double line
active:  I saw
novoice: with delight belonged to a man with naked feet
active:  I was at once convinced from
active:  you had told me
active:  the latter was your son
active:  The first had walked
noverb:  ways
active:  the other had run swiftly
passive: his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  that he had passed after the other
active:  I followed them up
noverb:  found they led to the hall window
active:  Boots had worn all the snow away
noverb:  waiting
active:  Then I walked to the other end
active:  was a hundred yards
noverb:  down the lane
active:  I saw
active:  Boots had faced round
passive: the snow was cut up as
active:  there had been a struggle
noverb:  finally
active:  a few drops of blood had fallen
active:  to show me
passive: I was not mistaken
active:  Boots had
active:  run down the lane
active:  another little smudge of blood showed
active:  it was he
passive: had been hurt
active:  When he came to the highroad at the other end
active:  I found
passive: the pavement had been cleared
active:  there was an end
noverb:  to
noverb:  clue
active:  entering the house
noverb:  however
active:  I examined
active:  you remember
noverb:  the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens
active:  I could at once see
active:  someone had passed out
active:  I could distinguish the outline of an instep
passive: the wet foot had been placed
active:  coming in
active:  I was
active:  beginning to be able
active:  to form an opinion as to
active:  had occurred
active:  A man had waited outside the window
active:  someone had brought the gems
passive: the deed had been overseen by your son
active:  he had pursued the thief
active:  had struggled with him
active:  they had each tugged at the coronet
active:  their united strength causing injuries
noverb:  alone could have effected
active:  He had returned with the prize
active:  had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent
noverb:  So far
active:  I was clear
active:  The question now was
noverb:  who was the man
noverb:  who was it
noverb:  brought him the coronet
active:  It is an old maxim of mine
active:  you have excluded the impossible
noverb:  remains
noverb:  however improbable
active:  must be the truth
noverb:  Now,
active:  I knew
active:  it was not you
active:  had brought it down
active:  there only remained your niece and the maids
active:  it were the maids
active:  should your son allow himself
passive: to be accused in their place
active:  There could be no possible reason
noverb:  As he loved his cousin
noverb:  however
active:  there was an excellent explanation
noverb:  why he should retain her secret
noverb:  the
active:  the secret was a disgraceful one
active:  When I remembered
active:  you had seen her at that window
active:  she had fainted
active:  seeing the coronet again
active:  my conjecture became a certainty
noverb:  And
active:  could it be
noverb:  was her confederate
noverb:  A lover evidently
noverb:  for
active:  else could outweigh the love
noverb:  gratitude
active:  she must feel to
noverb:  you
active:  I knew
active:  you went out little
active:  your circle of friends was a very limited one
active:  among them was Sir George Burnwell
active:  I had heard of him
active:  being a man of evil reputation among women
active:  It must have been he
active:  wore those boots
active:  retained the missing gems
active:  he knew
active:  Arthur had discovered him
active:  he might still
active:  flatter himself
active:  he was safe
noverb:  , for the lad could not say a word
active:  compromising his own family
noverb:  Well,
active:  your own good sense will suggest
noverb:  measures I took next
active:  I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house
novoice: managed
active:  to pick up an acquaintance with his valet
noverb:  learned
active:  his master had cut his head the night before
active:  finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure
active:  buying a pair of his cast-off shoes
noverb:  With these I journeyed down to Streatham
noverb:  saw
active:  they exactly fitted the tracks
active:  I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
active:  said Mr. Holder
noverb:  Precisely
active:  It was I. I
active:  found
active:  I had my man
active:  I came home
active:  changed my clothes
active:  It was a delicate part
active:  I had
active:  to play
noverb:  for I saw
passive: a prosecution must be avoided
active:  to avert scandal
active:  I knew
noverb:  so astute a villain would see
active:  our hands
passive: were tied in the matter
active:  I went and saw him
active:  At first, of course, he denied everything
noverb:  I gave him every particular
active:  had occurred
active:  he tried
active:  to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall
active:  I knew my man
noverb:  however
active:  I clapped a pistol to his head
active:  he could strike
active:  he became a little more reasonable
active:  I told him
noverb:  we would give him a price for the stones he held
noverb:  $1000 apiece
active:  That brought out the first signs of grief
active:  he had shown
noverb:  dash it all
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I've let them go at six hundred for the three
active:  I soon managed
active:  to get the address of the receiver
active:  had them
active:  promising him
active:  there would be no prosecution
novoice: Off I set to him
noverb:  after much chaffering
active:  I got our stones at $1000 apiece
novoice: Then I looked in upon your son
active:  told him
noverb:  all was right
active:  eventually got to my bed about two o'clock
noverb:  after
active:  I may call a really hard day's work
noverb:  A day
active:  has saved England from a great public scandal
active:  said the banker, rising
noverb:  Sir
active:  I cannot find words
active:  to thank you
active:  you shall not find me ungrateful for
active:  you have done
active:  Your skill has indeed exceeded all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  it
active:  And now I must fly to my dear boy
active:  to apologise to him for the wrong
active:  I have done him
noverb:  As to
active:  you tell me of poor Mary
active:  it goes to my very heart
active:  Not even your skill can inform me
active:  she is now
active:  I think
active:  we may safely say
active:  returned Holmes
active:  she is
active:  Sir George Burnwell is
active:  It is equally certain
noverb:  , too
active:  her sins are
active:  they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
noverb:  XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
noverb:  To the man
noverb:  loves art for its own sake
active:  remarked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph
active:  it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations
active:  the keenest pleasure is to be derived
active:  It is pleasant
noverb:  to me
active:  to observe
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have so far grasped this truth
noverb:  in these little records of our cases
active:  you have been good enough
active:  to draw up
passive: I am bound
active:  to say
noverb:  occasionally
active:  to embellish
active:  you have given prominence not
noverb:  much to the many causes celebres
noverb:  sensational trials in
active:  I have figured
noverb:  rather to those incidents
active:  may have been trivial in themselves
active:  have given room for those faculties of deduction
noverb:  of logical synthesis
active:  I have made my special province
noverb:  And
active:  said I
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism
passive: has been urged against my records
active:  You have erred
noverb:  perhaps
active:  he observed
active:  taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs
noverb:  lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe
active:  was wont
active:  to replace his clay
active:  he was in a disputatious rather
noverb:  a meditative mood
active:  you have erred perhaps
active:  attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead
active:  confining yourself to the task
active:  placing upon record
noverb:  severe reasoning from cause to effect
active:  is really the only notable feature about the thing
active:  It seems to me
active:  I have done
active:  you full justice in the matter
active:  I remarked with some coldness
noverb:  for I was repelled by the egotism
passive: I had more than once observed
active:  to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character
noverb:  No
active:  it is not selfishness
noverb:  or conceit
active:  said he
noverb:  answering
active:  was his wont
noverb:  my thoughts rather
noverb:  my words
noverb:  If I claim full justice for my art
active:  it is
active:  it is an impersonal thing
noverb:  --a thing beyond myself
active:  Crime is common
active:  Logic is rare
active:  Therefore it is upon the logic rather
noverb:  upon the crime
active:  you should dwell
active:  You have degraded
active:  should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
active:  It was a cold morning of the early spring
active:  we sat after breakfast on
noverb:  side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street
novoice: A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses
novoice: the opposing windows loomed
noverb:  dark
noverb:  shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths
passive: Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china
noverb:  metal
passive: for the table had not been cleared yet
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning
active:  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last
active:  having apparently given up his search
active:  he had emerged in no very sweet temper
active:  to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
noverb:  At the same time
active:  he remarked after a pause
noverb:  during
active:  he had sat puffing at his long pipe
active:  gazing down into the fire
active:  you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism
noverb:  for out of these cases
active:  you have been so kind as
active:  to interest yourself in
active:  a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all
noverb:  The small matter in
active:  I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem
novoice: connected with the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  the incident of the noble bachelor
active:  were all matters
active:  are outside the pale of the law
active:  avoiding the sensational
active:  I fear
active:  you may have bordered on the trivial
active:  The end may have been
active:  I answered
noverb:  the methods
active:  I hold to have been novel
noverb:  of interest
noverb:  Pshaw
noverb:  my dear fellow
active:  do the public
noverb:  the great unobservant public
active:  could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb
noverb:  care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction
noverb:  indeed
active:  you are trivial
active:  I cannot blame you
active:  for the days of the great cases are past
noverb:  Man
noverb:  at least criminal man
active:  has lost all enterprise and originality
noverb:  As to my own little practice
active:  it seems
active:  to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils
noverb:  giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools
active:  I think
active:  I have touched bottom at last
noverb:  however
noverb:  This note
active:  I had this morning marks my zero-point

noverb:  it

active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  is her ring
active:  It may turn out
active:  to be of more interest
active:  you think
active:  You remember

active:  appeared to be a mere whim at first
noverb:  developed into a serious investigation
active:  It may be
noverb:  in this case
noverb:  also

active:  to greet her
active:  I have had a very strange experience
active:  I have no parents or relations of any sort from

noverb:  without success
noverb:  At last the little money
active:  I had saved
active:  began
active:  to run short
active:  I was at my wit's end as to

active:  for governesses in the West End called Westaway's
noverb:  there

noverb:  There
active:  it is in a nutshell

active:  You may imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  to me
noverb:  destitute
active:  I was
novoice: such an offer seemed almost too good
active:  to be true
noverb:  The gentleman
noverb:  however
active:  seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
active:  opened a pocket-book
active:  took out a note
active:  It is also my custom
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face
active:  to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand
active:  they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe
active:  It seemed to me
active:  I had never met
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  so thoughtful a man
active:  As I was already in debt to my tradesmen
active:  the advance was a great convenience
active:  there was something
noverb:  unnatural about the whole transaction
noverb:  made me wish
active:  to know a little
noverb:  I quite committed myself
active:  May I ask
noverb:  you live
noverb:  sir
active:  said I.
noverb:  Hampshire
noverb:  Charming rural place
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  five miles on the far side of Winchester
active:  It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house
noverb:  And my duties
noverb:  sir
active:  I should be glad
active:  to know
active:  they would be
noverb:  One child
noverb:  one dear little romper just six years old
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper
noverb:  Smack! smack! smack
active:  Three gone
active:  you could wink
active:  He leaned back in his chair
active:  laughed his eyes into his head again
active:  I was a little
novoice: startled at the nature of the child's amusement
novoice: the father's laughter made me think
active:  perhaps he was joking
noverb:  My sole duties
active:  I asked
active:  are to take charge of a single child
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  not the sole
active:  not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried
active:  Your duty would be
active:  I am sure your good sense
active:  would suggest
active:  to obey any little commands
active:  my wife might give
novoice: provided always
active:  they were such commands
active:  a lady might with propriety obey
active:  You see no difficulty, heh
active:  I should be happy
active:  to make myself useful
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  In dress now
noverb:  for example
active:  We are faddy people
active:  you know
noverb:  faddy
noverb:  kind-hearted
passive: you were asked
active:  to wear any dress
active:  we might give you
active:  you would not object to our little whim
noverb:  Heh
noverb:  No
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  considerably astonished at his words
noverb:  Or
active:  to sit here
active:  sit there
active:  that would not be offensive to you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  Or
active:  to cut your hair quite short
noverb:  before you come to us
active:  I could hardly believe my ears
noverb:  As you may observe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  my hair is somewhat luxuriant
noverb:  of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut
active:  It has been considered artistic
active:  I could not dream
active:  sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that
active:  is quite impossible
active:  said
active:  I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes
active:  I could see a shadow
active:  pass over his face as I spoke
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it is quite essential
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  It is a little fancy of my wife's
noverb:  ladies' fancies
active:  you know
noverb:  madam
passive: ladies' fancies must be consulted
noverb:  And
noverb:  you won't cut your hair
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I really could not
active:  I answered firmly
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  very well
noverb:  quite settles the matter
active:  It is a pity
active:  in other respects
active:  you would really have done very nicely
noverb:  In
noverb:  case
noverb:  Miss Stoper
active:  I had
active:  best inspect a few
noverb:  of your young ladies
active:  The manageress had sat all this
noverb:  busy with her papers without a word to
noverb:  of us
active:  she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face
active:  I could not help
active:  suspecting
active:  she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
active:  Do you desire your name
passive: to be kept upon the books
active:  she asked
noverb:  you
noverb:  Miss Stoper
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  it seems rather useless
active:  you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion
active:  said
noverb:  she sharply
active:  You can hardly expect us
active:  to exert ourselves
active:  to find another such opening for you
noverb:  Good-day to you, Miss Hunter
active:  She struck a gong upon the table
passive: I was shown out by the page
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got back to my lodgings
noverb:  found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table
active:  I began to ask myself
active:  I had not done a very foolish thing
noverb:  After all
active:  these people had strange fads
noverb:  expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters
active:  they were at least ready
active:  to pay for their eccentricity
active:  Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year
noverb:  Besides
active:  use was my hair to me
passive: Many people are improved
active:  wearing
active:  it short
active:  perhaps I should be among the number
noverb:  Next day I was inclined
active:  to think
active:  I had made a mistake
noverb:  by the day after
active:  I was sure
noverb:  of it
active:  I had almost overcome my pride
active:  to go back to the agency
active:  inquire
active:  the place was still open
noverb:  I received this letter from the gentleman himself
active:  I have it here
active:  I will read it to you
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  near Winchester
noverb:  DEAR MISS HUNTER
active:  Miss Stoper has very kindly
noverb:  given me your address
active:  I write from here
active:  to ask you
active:  you have reconsidered your decision
active:  My wife is very anxious
active:  you should come
noverb:  for she has been much
novoice: attracted by my description of you
active:  We are willing
active:  to give $30 a quarter
noverb:  $120 a year
active:  to recompense you for any little inconvenience
active:  our fads may cause you
active:  They are not very exacting
noverb:  , after all
active:  My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue
active:  would like you
active:  to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
active:  You need not
noverb:  however
active:  go to the expense
active:  purchasing one
active:  we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia)
active:  would
active:  I should think
novoice: fit you very well
noverb:  as to sitting here
noverb:  there
noverb:  amusing yourself in any manner indicated
noverb:  that need cause you no inconvenience
noverb:  As regards your hair
active:  it is no doubt
noverb:  a pity
noverb:  especially as I could not help
active:  remarking its beauty during our short interview
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must remain firm upon this point
active:  I only hope
active:  the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
noverb:  Your duties
passive: the child is concerned
active:  are very light
active:  Now do try to come
active:  I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester
noverb:  Let me know your train
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  JEPHRO RUCASTLE
active:  That is the letter
active:  I have just received
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: my mind is made up
active:  I will accept it
active:  I thought
noverb:  however
active:  taking the final step
active:  I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Miss Hunter
passive: your mind is made up
active:  that settles the question
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  you would not advise me
active:  to refuse
active:  I confess
active:  it is not the situation
noverb:  which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
active:  is the meaning of it all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Ah
active:  I have no data
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
noverb:  Well,
active:  there seems to me
active:  to be only one possible solution
active:  Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to be a very kind, good-natured man
active:  Is it not possible
noverb:  that his wife is a lunatic
active:  he desires to keep the matter
active:  quiet for fear
passive: she should be taken to an asylum
active:  he humours her fancies in every way in order
active:  to prevent an outbreak
active:  That is a possible solution
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  as matters stand
active:  it is the most probable one
active:  in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
noverb:  the money, Mr. Holmes, the money
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
active:  of course the pay is good
noverb:  too good
active:  That is
active:  makes me uneasy
noverb:  should they give you $120 a year
active:  they could have their pick for $40
active:  There must be some strong reason behind
active:  I thought
noverb:  I told you the circumstances
active:  you would understand afterwards
active:  I wanted your help
active:  I should feel so much stronger
active:  I felt
active:  you were at the back of me
noverb:  Oh
active:  you may carry that feeling away with you
active:  I assure you
active:  your little problem promises to be the most interesting
active:  has come my way for some months
active:  There is something
noverb:  distinctly novel about some of the features
active:  you should find yourself in doubt
noverb:  in danger
noverb:  Danger
noverb:  danger do you foresee
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  It would cease to be a danger
active:  we could define it
active:  said he
noverb:  at any time, day or night
active:  a telegram would bring me down to your help
active:  That is enough
active:  She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
active:  I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now
active:  I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once
noverb:  sacrifice my poor hair to-night
noverb:  start for Winchester to-morrow
active:  With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
noverb:  good-night
novoice: bustled off upon her way
noverb:  At least
active:  said I
active:  we heard her quick
noverb:  firm steps descending the stairs
active:  she seems to be a young lady
noverb:  who is very well able
active:  to take care of herself
active:  And she would need
active:  to be
active:  said Holmes gravely
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  we do not hear from her
active:  many days are past
active:  It was not very long
noverb:  before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
active:  A fortnight went by
noverb:  during
active:  I frequently found
active:  my thoughts turning in her direction
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
noverb:  The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a fad
noverb:  a plot
active:  the man were a philanthropist or a villain
active:  it was quite beyond my powers
active:  to determine
noverb:  As to Holmes
active:  I observed
active:  he sat frequently for half an hour on end
noverb:  with knitted brows
noverb:  an abstracted air
active:  he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand
active:  I mentioned it
noverb:  Data! data! data
active:  he cried impatiently
noverb:  I can't make bricks without clay
noverb:  And
active:  he would always wind up
active:  muttering
noverb:  no sister of his should ever
active:  have accepted such a situation
noverb:  The telegram
active:  we eventually received
active:  came late one night just
active:  I was thinking
active:  turning in
active:  Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches
novoice: he frequently indulged in
active:  I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night
active:  find him in the same position
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning
active:  He opened the yellow envelope
active:  glancing at the message
active:  threw it across to me
active:  Just look up the trains in Bradshaw
active:  said he
noverb:  turned back to his chemical studies
active:  The summons was a brief
noverb:  urgent one
active:  be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow
active:  it said
active:  Do come
active:  I am at my wit's end
noverb:  HUNTER
active:  Will you come with me
active:  asked Holmes
active:  glancing up
active:  I should wish to
noverb:  Just look it up
active:  There is a train
noverb:  at half-past nine
active:  said I
active:  glancing over my Bradshaw
active:  It is due
noverb:  at Winchester at 11
noverb:  30
active:  That will do very nicely
active:  perhaps I had
active:  better postpone my analysis of the acetones
noverb:  as we may need
active:  to be at our best in the morning
noverb:  By eleven o'clock the next day
active:  we were well upon our way to the old English capital
active:  Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down
noverb:  after we had passed the Hampshire border
active:  he threw them down
active:  began to admire the scenery
noverb:  It was an ideal spring day
noverb:  a light blue sky
passive: flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east
active:  The sun was shining very brightly
active:  there was an exhilarating nip in the air
novoice: set an edge to a man's energy
noverb:  All over the countryside
noverb:  away to the rolling hills around Aldershot
novoice: the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
active:  Are they not fresh
noverb:  beautiful
active:  I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  it is one
noverb:  of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine
active:  I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject
active:  You look at these scattered houses
passive: you are impressed by their beauty
active:  I look at them
noverb:  the only thought
active:  comes
active:  to me is a feeling of their isolation
noverb:  and of the impunity with
passive: crime may be committed there
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
active:  They always fill me with a certain horror
active:  It is my belief, Watson
passive: founded upon my experience
active:  the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
active:  does the smiling and beautiful countryside
active:  You horrify me
active:  the reason is very obvious
active:  The pressure of public opinion can do in the town
active:  the law cannot accomplish
active:  There is no lane
noverb:  so vile
noverb:  the scream of a tortured child
noverb:  the thud of a drunkard's blow
active:  does not beget sympathy
noverb:  indignation among the neighbours
active:  the whole machinery of justice is
noverb:  close
noverb:  a word of complaint can set it going
active:  there is
noverb:  a step between the crime and the dock
active:  look at these lonely houses
noverb:  each in its own fields
passive: filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk
active:  know little of the law
noverb:  Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty
noverb:  the hidden wickedness
active:  may go on
noverb:  year in
noverb:  year out, in such places, and none the wiser
active:  Had this lady
active:  appeals
active:  to us for help gone
active:  to live in Winchester
active:  I should never have had a fear for her
active:  It is the five miles of country
noverb:  which makes the danger
noverb:  Still,
active:  it is clear
noverb:  that she is not personally threatened
noverb:  No
active:  she can come to Winchester
active:  to meet us
active:  she can get away
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  She has her freedom
active:  can be the matter
active:  Can you suggest no explanation
active:  I have devised seven separate explanations
noverb:  each of
active:  would cover the facts
active:  we know them
noverb:  of these is correct
passive: can only be determined by the fresh information
active:  we shall no doubt find waiting for us
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is the tower of the cathedral
active:  we shall soon learn all
active:  Miss Hunter has
active:  to tell
active:  The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street
noverb:  at no distance from the station
noverb:  there
active:  we found the young lady waiting for us
active:  She had engaged a sitting-room
active:  our lunch awaited us upon the table
active:  I am so delighted
noverb:  that you have come
active:  she said earnestly
active:  It is
noverb:  very kind of you
active:  indeed I do not know
active:  I should do
active:  Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
active:  Pray
active:  tell us
active:  has happened to
noverb:  you
active:  I will do
active:  I must be quick
noverb:  , for I have promised Mr. Rucastle
active:  to be back
noverb:  three
active:  I got his leave
active:  to come into town this morning
active:  he little knew for
noverb:  purpose
noverb:  Let us have everything in its due order
noverb:  Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire
active:  composed himself
active:  to listen
noverb:  In the first place
active:  I may say
active:  I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
active:  It is only fair
noverb:  to them
active:  to say that
active:  But I cannot understand them
active:  I am not easy
noverb:  in my mind about them
active:  can you not understand
noverb:  Their reasons for their conduct
active:  you shall have it all just
active:  it occurred
active:  When I came down
novoice: Mr. Rucastle met me here
active:  drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches
active:  It is
noverb:  as he said
noverb:  beautifully situated
active:  it is not beautiful
noverb:  in itself
active:  for it is a large square block of a house
noverb:  whitewashed
noverb:  all stained
novoice: streaked with damp
noverb:  bad weather
novoice: There are grounds round it
noverb:  woods on three sides
noverb:  on the fourth a field
active:  slopes down to the Southampton highroad
passive: curves past about a hundred yards from the front door
noverb:  This ground in front belongs to the house
noverb:  the woods all round
active:  are part of Lord Southerton's preserves
active:  A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
passive: I was driven over by my employer
active:  was
passive: was introduced by him
active:  evening to his wife and the child
active:  There was no truth
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  in the conjecture
active:  seemed to us
active:  to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street
active:  Mrs. Rucastle is not mad
active:  I found her
active:  to be a silent, pale-faced woman
noverb:  much younger
noverb:  her husband
noverb:  not more than thirty
active:  I should think
active:  he can hardly be less than forty-five
active:  From their conversation I have gathered
active:  they have been married about seven years
active:  he was a widower
active:  his only child by the first wife was the daughter
active:  has gone to Philadelphia
active:  Mr. Rucastle told me in private
noverb:  the reason
active:  she had left
active:  them was
active:  she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother
active:  As the daughter could not have been less than twenty
active:  I can quite imagine
active:  her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife
active:  Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me
active:  to be colourless in mind
noverb:  in feature
active:  She impressed me
noverb:  favourably
noverb:  the reverse
active:  She was a nonentity
active:  It was easy
active:  to see
passive: she was passionately devoted
noverb:  to her husband
noverb:  to her little son
noverb:  Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other
active:  noting every little want
active:  forestalling it
noverb:  possible
active:  He was kind
noverb:  to her also in his bluff
noverb:  boisterous fashion
noverb:  on the whole
active:  they seemed to be a happy couple
noverb:  And
active:  she had some secret sorrow
noverb:  this woman
passive: She would often be lost in deep thought
noverb:  with the saddest look upon her face
active:  More than once I have surprised her in tears
active:  I have thought sometimes
active:  it was the disposition of her child
active:  weighed upon her mind
noverb:  for I have never met
noverb:  utterly spoiled
noverb:  so ill-natured a little creature
active:  He is small
noverb:  for his age
noverb:  with a head
active:  is quite disproportionately large
active:  His whole life appears
passive: to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals
active:  sulking
noverb:  Giving pain to any creature weaker
active:  himself seems to be his one idea of amusement
active:  he shows quite remarkable talent
active:  planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects
active:  But I would rather not talk about the creature
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  indeed
active:  he has little
active:  to do with my story
active:  I am glad
noverb:  of all details
active:  remarked my friend
active:  they seem to
noverb:  you
active:  to be relevant
noverb:  not
active:  I shall try not
active:  to miss anything of importance
noverb:  The one unpleasant thing about the house
active:  struck me at once
active:  was the appearance and conduct of the servants
active:  There are only two
noverb:  , a man and his wife
noverb:  Toller
noverb:  for
active:  is his name
active:  is a rough, uncouth man
noverb:  with grizzled hair and whiskers
noverb:  a perpetual smell of drink
noverb:  Twice
active:  I have been with them
active:  he has been quite drunk
novoice: Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to take no notice of it
active:  His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  much less amiable
active:  They are a most unpleasant couple
active:  fortunately I spend
noverb:  of my time in the nursery
noverb:  my own room
active:  are next to each other in one corner of the building
active:  For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet
noverb:  on the third
active:  Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  turning to me
active:  we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter,
active:  falling in with our whims
active:  to cut your hair
active:  I assure you
active:  it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance
active:  We shall now see
active:  the electric-blue dress will become you
active:  You will find
active:  it laid out upon the bed in your room
active:  you would be so good
noverb:  as
active:  to put it on we should
active:  be extremely obliged
noverb:  The dress
active:  I found
noverb:  waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue
active:  It was of excellent material
noverb:  a sort of beige
active:  it bore unmistakable signs
passive: having been worn before
active:  It could not have been a better fit
passive: I had been measured for
noverb:  it
noverb:  Both Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it
active:  seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence
active:  They were waiting for me in the drawing-room
active:  is a very large room
noverb:  stretching along the entire front of the house
active:  with three long windows reaching down to the floor
active:  A chair had been placed close to the central window
novoice: with its back turned towards
noverb:  it
passive: In this I was asked
active:  to sit
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
novoice: walking up and down on the other side of the room
noverb:  began to tell me a series of the funniest stories
active:  I have ever listened to
active:  You cannot imagine
noverb:  comical he was
active:  I laughed
active:  I was quite weary
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  however
active:  has evidently no sense of humour
noverb:  never
novoice: smiled
noverb:  sat with her hands in her lap
noverb:  a sad, anxious look upon her face
noverb:  After an hour
active:  Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked
active:  it was time
active:  to commence the duties of the day
active:  I might change my dress
active:  go to little Edward in the nursery
noverb:  Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances
active:  Again I changed my dress
active:  again I sat in the window
active:  again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of
active:  my employer had an immense repertoire
active:  he told inimitably
noverb:  he handed me a yellow-backed novel
active:  moving my chair a little sideways
active:  my own shadow might not fall upon the page
active:  he begged me
active:  to read aloud to him
active:  I read for about ten minutes
noverb:  beginning in the heart of a chapter
active:  suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me
active:  to cease
active:  to change my dress
active:  You can easily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  curious I became as to
active:  the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be
active:  They were always very careful
active:  I observed
active:  to turn my face away from the window
active:  I became consumed with the desire
active:  to see
active:  was going on behind my back
noverb:  At first it seemed
active:  to be impossible
active:  I soon devised a means
noverb:  My hand-mirror had been broken
active:  a happy thought seized me
active:  I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief
noverb:  On the next occasion
noverb:  in the midst of my laughter
active:  I put my handkerchief up to my eyes
active:  was able with a little management
active:  to see all
active:  there was behind me
active:  I confess
passive: I was disappointed
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  At least
active:  was my first impression
noverb:  At the second glance
noverb:  however
active:  I perceived
active:  there was a man standing in the Southampton Road
active:  a small bearded man in a grey suit
active:  seemed
active:  to be looking in my direction
active:  The road is an important highway
novoice: there are usually people there
noverb:  This man
noverb:  however
active:  was leaning against the railings
active:  bordered our field
active:  was looking earnestly up
active:  I lowered my handkerchief
active:  glanced at Mrs. Rucastle
active:  to find
active:  her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze
active:  She said nothing
passive: I am convinced
active:  she had divined
active:  I had a mirror in my hand
active:  had seen
active:  was behind me
active:  She rose at once
noverb:  Jephro
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there
noverb:  stares up at Miss Hunter
noverb:  No friend of yours
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  he asked
noverb:  No
active:  I know no one in these parts
noverb:  Dear me
noverb:  very impertinent
noverb:  Kindly turn round
noverb:  motion to him
active:  to go away
noverb:  Surely
active:  it would be better
active:  to take no notice
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  we should have him loitering here always
noverb:  Kindly turn round
active:  wave him away
noverb:  that
active:  I did
passive: I was told
active:  at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind
active:  That was a week ago
noverb:  from
active:  time
active:  I have not sat again in the window
noverb:  have I worn the blue dress
active:  seen the man in the road
active:  Pray
active:  continue
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Your narrative promises
active:  to be a most interesting one
active:  You will find it rather disconnected
active:  I fear
active:  there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
active:  I speak
noverb:  On the very first day
active:  I was at the Copper Beeches
active:  Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse
noverb:  stands near the kitchen door
active:  we approached it
active:  I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
noverb:  the sound as of a large animal moving about
noverb:  Look in here
active:  said Mr. Rucastle
noverb:  showing me a slit between two planks
noverb:  Is he not a beauty
active:  I looked through
active:  was conscious of two glowing eyes
novoice: of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
passive: Don't be frightened
active:  said
noverb:  my employer
active:  laughing at the start
active:  I had given
active:  It's only Carlo
noverb:  my mastiff
active:  I call him mine
noverb:  really old Toller
noverb:  my groom
active:  is the only man
active:  can do anything with him
noverb:  We feed him once a day
noverb:  not too much
active:  he is always
noverb:  mustard
noverb:  Toller lets him loose every night
active:  God help the trespasser
active:  he lays his fangs upon
noverb:  For goodness' sake don't you
novoice: on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night
noverb:  for it's
active:  your life is worth
noverb:  The warning was no idle one
active:  for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
active:  It was a beautiful moonlight night
passive: the lawn in front of the house was silvered over
noverb:  almost
noverb:  day
active:  I was standing
noverb:  rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene
active:  I was aware
active:  that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches
active:  it emerged into the moonshine
active:  I saw
active:  it was
active:  It was a giant dog
noverb:  a calf
noverb:  tawny tinted
noverb:  with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones
active:  It walked slowly across the lawn
novoice: vanished into the shadow upon the other side
active:  dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
active:  I do not think
active:  any burglar could have done
active:  And now I have a very strange experience
active:  to tell you
active:  I had
active:  you know
active:  cut off my hair in London
active:  I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk
noverb:  One evening
active:  after the child was in bed
active:  I began to amuse myself
active:  examining the furniture of my room
active:  rearranging my own little things
active:  There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open
noverb:  the lower one locked
noverb:  I had filled the first two with my linen
active:  I had still much
noverb:  to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
active:  It struck me
passive: it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
active:  I took out my bunch of keys
active:  tried
active:  to open it
active:  The very first key fitted to perfection
active:  I drew the drawer open
active:  There was only one thing in it
active:  I am sure
active:  you would never guess
active:  it was
active:  It was my coil of hair
active:  I took it up
active:  examined it
active:  It was of the same peculiar tint
noverb:  the same thickness
active:  the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me
active:  could my hair
passive: have been locked in the drawer
active:  With trembling hands I undid my trunk
passive: turned out the contents
active:  drew from the bottom my own hair
active:  I laid the two tresses together
active:  I assure you
active:  they were identical
active:  Was it not extraordinary
noverb:  Puzzle as I would
active:  I could make nothing at all of
novoice: it meant
active:  I returned the strange hair to the drawer
active:  I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt
active:  I had put myself in the wrong
active:  opening a drawer
active:  they had locked
active:  I am naturally observant
noverb:  , as you may have remarked
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
active:  There was one wing
noverb:  however
active:  appeared not
passive: to be inhabited at all
noverb:  A door
active:  faced
novoice: led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite
passive: it was invariably locked
noverb:  One day
noverb:  however
active:  I ascended the stair
active:  I met Mr. Rucastle
active:  coming out through this door
noverb:  his keys in his hand
noverb:  a look on his face
noverb:  made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to
passive: I was accustomed
active:  His cheeks were red
active:  his brow was all crinkled with anger
active:  the veins stood out at his temples with passion
active:  He locked the door
active:  hurried past me without a word or a look
noverb:  This aroused my curiosity
active:  I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge
active:  I strolled round to the side from
active:  I could see the windows of this part of the house
active:  There were four of them
noverb:  in a row
noverb:  three of
active:  were simply dirty
passive: the fourth was shuttered up
active:  They were evidently all
noverb:  deserted
novoice: As I strolled up and down
active:  glancing at them occasionally
active:  Mr. Rucastle came out to me
noverb:  looking as merry
noverb:  jovial as
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you must not think me rude
active:  I passed you without a word, my dear young lady
passive: I was preoccupied with business matters
active:  I assured him
passive: I was not offended
noverb:  By the way
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there
active:  one of them has the shutters up
active:  He looked surprised
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  a little startled at my remark
active:  Photography is one of my hobbies
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I have made my dark room up there
noverb:  dear me!
noverb:  an observant young lady
active:  we have come upon
active:  would have believed it
active:  would have ever believed it
active:  He spoke in a jesting tone
active:  there was no jest
noverb:  in his eyes
active:  he looked at me
noverb:  I read suspicion there
noverb:  annoyance
noverb:  no jest
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  from the moment
active:  I understood
active:  there was something
noverb:  about that suite of rooms
active:  I was not to know
novoice: I was all
noverb:  on fire
active:  to go over them
active:  It was not mere curiosity
active:  I have my share of that
active:  It was more
noverb:  a feeling of duty
noverb:  a feeling
active:  some good might come from my penetrating to this place
noverb:  They talk of woman's instinct
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it was woman's instinct
active:  gave me
noverb:  feeling
noverb:  At any rate
active:  it was there
noverb:  ,
active:  I was keenly on the lookout for any chance
active:  to pass the forbidden door
active:  It was only yesterday
active:  the chance came
active:  I may tell you
noverb:  , besides Mr. Rucastle,
noverb:  Toller
active:  his wife find something
active:  to do in these deserted rooms
noverb:  I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door
active:  Recently he has been drinking hard
noverb:  yesterday evening
active:  he was very drunk
active:  and when I came upstairs
active:  there was the key in the door
active:  I have no doubt at all
noverb:  he had left it there
noverb:  Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle were
noverb:  downstairs
active:  the child was with them
active:  I had an admirable opportunity
active:  I turned the key gently in the lock
active:  opened the door
novoice: slipped through
active:  There was a little passage in front of me
noverb:  unpapered
noverb:  uncarpeted
active:  turned at a right angle at the farther end
active:  Round
active:  this corner were three doors in a line
noverb:  the first
noverb:  third of
active:  were open
noverb:  They each led into an empty room
noverb:  dusty
noverb:  cheerless
noverb:  with two windows in the one and one in the other
noverb:  thick with dirt
active:  the evening light glimmered dimly through them
passive: The centre door was closed
noverb:  across the
noverb:  of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed
novoice: padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall
novoice: fastened at the other with stout cord
noverb:  The door
passive: itself was locked as well
active:  the key was not there
active:  This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window
active:  I could see by the glimmer from beneath it
active:  the room was not in darkness
noverb:  Evidently
active:  there was a skylight
noverb:  which let in light from above
active:  As I stood
active:  in the passage gazing at the sinister door
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  secret it might veil
novoice: I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
active:  saw a shadow pass backward
noverb:  forward against the little slit of dim light
novoice: shone out from under the door
active:  A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes
active:  My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly
active:  I turned and ran
active:  ran as
active:  some dreadful hand were
active:  behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress
active:  I rushed down the passage, through the door,
noverb:  straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle
active:  was waiting
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  smiling
active:  it was you
active:  I thought
active:  it must be
active:  I saw the door
active:  open
noverb:  Oh
active:  I am so frightened
active:  I panted
noverb:  My dear young lady! my dear young lady
active:  you cannot think
noverb:  caressing
active:  soothing
active:  his manner was
active:  has frightened you, my dear young lady
active:  his voice was just a little too coaxing
active:  He overdid it
active:  I was keenly on my guard against him
active:  I was foolish enough
active:  to go into the empty wing
active:  I answered
active:  it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light
passive: I was frightened and ran out again
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is
noverb:  dreadfully still in there
noverb:  Only that
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  looking at me keenly
noverb:  did you think
active:  I asked
active:  do you think
active:  I lock this door
active:  I am sure
active:  I do not know
active:  It is to keep people out
noverb:  have no business there
noverb:  Do you see
active:  He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
active:  I am sure
active:  I had known
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know now
noverb:  And
noverb:  you
novoice: put your foot over that threshold again
noverb:  here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage
active:  he glared down at me with the face of a demon
active:  I'll throw you to the mastiff
active:  I was so terrified
noverb:  that I do not know
active:  I did
active:  I suppose
active:  I must have rushed past him into my room
active:  I remember nothing
active:  I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
noverb:  Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I could not live there longer without some advice
passive: I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child
active:  They were all horrible to me
active:  If I could only bring you down all would be well
noverb:  Of course I might have fled from the house
active:  my curiosity was almost
noverb:  my fears
passive: My mind was soon made up
noverb:  I would send you a wire
active:  I put on my hat
noverb:  cloak
active:  went down to the office
active:  is about half a mile from the house
novoice: returned
noverb:  feeling very much easier
active:  A horrible doubt came into my mind
active:  I approached the door
active:  the dog might be loose
active:  I remembered
active:  Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility
noverb:  evening
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was the only one in the household
active:  had any influence with the savage creature
noverb:  would venture to set him free
active:  I slipped in in safety
noverb:  lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought
active:  seeing you
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  getting leave
active:  to come into Winchester this morning
active:  I must be back
noverb:  before three o'clock
active:  for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit
active:  will be away all the evening
active:  I must look after the child
active:  Now I have told you
active:  all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad
active:  you could tell me
noverb:  it all means
noverb:  above all
active:  I should do
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
noverb:  My friend rose now
novoice: paced up and down the room
noverb:  his hands in his pockets
noverb:  an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
noverb:  Is Toller still drunk
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
active:  I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle
active:  she could do nothing with him
active:  That is well
active:  And the Rucastles go out to-night?
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Is there a cellar with a good strong lock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  the wine-cellar
active:  You seem to me
active:  to have acted all through this matter
noverb:  a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter
active:  Do you think
active:  you could perform one more feat
active:  I should not ask it of you
noverb:  I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
active:  I will try
active:  is it
active:  We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock
noverb:  my friend
passive: I. The Rucastles will be gone by
noverb:  time
active:  Toller will
active:  we hope
active:  be incapable
active:  There only remains Mrs. Toller
active:  might give the alarm
active:  you could send her into the cellar on some errand
noverb:  turn the key upon her
active:  you would facilitate matters immensely
active:  I will do it
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We shall
noverb:  look thoroughly into the affair
noverb:  Of course
active:  there is only one feasible explanation
active:  You have been brought there
active:  to personate someone
passive: the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
active:  That is obvious
noverb:  As to
active:  this prisoner is
active:  I have no doubt
active:  it is the daughter
noverb:  Miss Alice Rucastle
active:  I remember right
passive: was said
active:  to have gone to America
passive: You were chosen
noverb:  doubtless
active:  resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair
passive: Hers had been cut off
noverb:  very possibly in some illness through
active:  she has passed
active:  , of course, yours had to be sacrificed also
active:  By a curious chance
active:  you came upon her tresses
active:  The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--
noverb:  no doubt
active:  you wore the girl's dress
active:  were
noverb:  her
passive: he was convinced from your laughter
active:  he saw you
noverb:  afterwards from your gesture
active:  Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
active:  she no longer desired his attentions
passive: The dog is let loose at night
active:  to prevent him
active:  endeavouring
active:  to communicate with her
active:  much is fairly clear
active:  The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
active:  on earth has
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  My dear Watson
noverb:  you
active:  a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
noverb:  Don't you see
active:  the converse is equally valid
active:  I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents
active:  studying their children
active:  This child's disposition is abnormally cruel
noverb:  merely for cruelty's sake
active:  he derives this from his smiling father
noverb:  as I should suspect
noverb:  from his mother
active:  it bodes evil for the poor girl
active:  is in their power
active:  I am sure
active:  you are right
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  cried our client
active:  A thousand things come back to me
active:  make me certain
active:  you have hit it
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
active:  We must be circumspect
noverb:  , for we are dealing with a very cunning man
active:  We can do nothing until seven o'clock
active:  At that hour we shall be with
noverb:  you
active:  it will not be long
active:  we solve the mystery
active:  We were
noverb:  our word
active:  for it was just seven
noverb:  when we reached the Copper Beeches
active:  having put up our trap at a wayside public-house
noverb:  The group of trees
noverb:  with their dark leaves shining
noverb:  burnished metal in the light of the setting sun
active:  were sufficient
active:  to mark the house even
active:  had Miss Hunter not
active:  been standing smiling on the door-step
active:  Have you managed it
active:  asked Holmes
active:  A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
active:  That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar
active:  said she
noverb:  Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
active:  Here are his keys
active:  are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's
active:  You have done well indeed
active:  cried Holmes with enthusiasm
active:  Now lead the way
active:  we shall soon see the end of this black business
active:  We passed up the stair
active:  unlocked the door
novoice: followed on down a passage
active:  found ourselves in front of the barricade
active:  Miss Hunter had described
active:  Holmes cut the cord
active:  removed the transverse bar
active:  he tried the various keys in the lock
noverb:  without success
active:  No sound came from within
novoice: at the silence Holmes' face clouded over
active:  I trust
active:  we are not too late
active:  said he
active:  I think
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  we had
active:  better go in without you
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  put your shoulder to it
active:  we shall see
active:  we cannot make our way in
noverb:  It was an old rickety door
active:  gave at once
noverb:  our united strength
active:  Together we rushed into the room
active:  It was empty
active:  There was no
active:  furniture save a little pallet bed
noverb:  a small table
noverb:  a basketful of linen
noverb:  The skylight
active:  was open
active:  the prisoner gone
active:  There has been some villainy here
active:  said Holmes
active:  this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions
active:  has carried his victim off
noverb:  Through the skylight
active:  We shall soon see
active:  he managed it
active:  He swung himself up onto the roof
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  he cried
noverb:  here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
active:  That is
active:  he did it
active:  it is impossible
active:  said Miss Hunter
active:  the ladder was not there
active:  the Rucastles went away
active:  He has come back
active:  done it
active:  I tell you
active:  he is a clever and dangerous man
active:  I should not be very much surprised
active:  this were he
noverb:  step I hear now upon the stair
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  it would be as well for
noverb:  you
active:  to have your pistol
active:  ready
active:  The words were hardly out of his mouth
active:  a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand
novoice: Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang forward
active:  confronted him
noverb:  You villain
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  where's your daughter
noverb:  The fat man cast his eyes round
noverb:  up at the open skylight
active:  It is for me
noverb:  to ask you that
active:  he shrieked
active:  you thieves
noverb:  Spies
noverb:  thieves
active:  I have caught you
active:  have I
active:  You are in my power
active:  I'll serve you
active:  He turned and clattered down the stairs
active:  he could go
active:  He's gone for the dog
active:  cried Miss Hunter
active:  I have my revolver
active:  said I.
noverb:  Better close the front door
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  we all rushed down the stairs together
active:  We had hardly reached the hall
active:  we heard the baying of a hound
noverb:  a scream of agony
noverb:  with a horrible worrying sound
active:  it was dreadful
active:  to listen to
noverb:  An elderly man with a red face
active:  shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
noverb:  My God
active:  he cried
active:  Someone has loosed the dog
active:  It's
passive: not been fed for two days
noverb:  Quick,
noverb:  quick
active:  it'll be too late
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  round the angle of the house
noverb:  with Toller hurrying behind us
active:  There was the huge famished brute
novoice: its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat
active:  he writhed and screamed upon the ground
active:  Running up
active:  I blew its brains out
noverb:  it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
active:  With much labour we separated them
active:  carried him
noverb:  living
noverb:  horribly mangled
noverb:  into the house
active:  We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa
active:  having dispatched the sobered Toller
active:  to bear the news to his wife
active:  I did
active:  I could to relieve his pain
active:  We were all assembled
active:  round him
active:  the door opened
active:  a tall, gaunt woman entered the room
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  cried Miss Hunter
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  miss
active:  Mr. Rucastle let me out
active:  he came back
active:  he went up to you
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  miss
noverb:  it is a pity you didn't let me know
active:  you were planning
noverb:  for I would have told you
active:  your pains
passive: were wasted
noverb:  Ha
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  looking keenly at her
active:  It is clear
active:  that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter
noverb:  anyone else
active:  Yes, sir, I do
active:  I am ready enough
active:  to tell
active:  I know
active:  pray
active:  sit down
noverb:  let us hear
active:  it for there are several points on
active:  I must confess
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I will soon make it clear
noverb:  to you
active:  said she
active:  and I'd have done
noverb:  now
noverb:  I could ha' got out from the cellar
active:  there's police-court business over this
active:  you'll remember
active:  I was the
noverb:  one
active:  stood your friend
active:  I was Miss Alice's friend too
active:  She was never happy
noverb:  at home
noverb:  Miss Alice wasn't
noverb:  from the time
noverb:  her father married again
passive: She was slighted
active:  had no say in anything
active:  it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house
active:  I could learn
active:  Miss Alice had rights of her own
active:  will
active:  she was so quiet and patient
active:  she was
active:  she never said
noverb:  a word about them
active:  just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands
active:  He knew
active:  he was safe
noverb:  with her
active:  there was a chance of a husband coming forward
active:  would ask for all
active:  the law would give him
novoice: her father thought it time
active:  to put a stop on it
active:  He wanted her
active:  to sign a paper
active:  she married
noverb:  not
noverb:  he could use her money
noverb:  When she wouldn't do it
active:  he kept
active:  worrying her
active:  she got brain-fever
active:  for six weeks was at death's door
active:  she got better at last
noverb:  all worn to a shadow
active:  with her beautiful hair cut off
noverb:  didn't make no change in her young man
active:  he stuck to her
active:  man could be
noverb:  Ah
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  you have been good enough
noverb:  to tell us makes the matter fairly clear
noverb:  ,
active:  I can deduce all
noverb:  remains
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
active:  I presume
active:  took to this system of imprisonment

active:  blockaded the house
active:  having met
active:  you succeeded by certain arguments
noverb:  metallic
active:  convincing you
active:  your interests
active:  were the same as his
active:  Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman
active:  said Mrs. Toller serenely
noverb:  And in this way
active:  he managed
active:  your good man should have no want of drink

noverb:  sir
noverb:  just
active:  it happened

noverb:  we owe you an apology
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  for you have certainly cleared up everything
active:  puzzled us
active:  And here comes the country surgeon
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
active:  it seems to me
noverb:  our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
noverb:  And
active:  was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
active:  Mr. Rucastle survived
active:  was always a broken man
active:  kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife

noverb:  Mr. Fowler

noverb:  As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes
noverb:  rather to my disappointment
active:  manifested no further interest in her
active:  once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems
active:  she is now the head of a private school at Walsall
active:  I believe
active:  she has met with considerable success

noverb:  PREFACE
noverb:  As things now stand
noverb:  the course of instruction in American history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
passive: Three separate books are used
noverb:  First,
active:  there is the primary book
active:  is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes
noverb:  Second
active:  there is the advanced text for the seventh
noverb:  eighth grade
noverb:  generally speaking
noverb:  an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words
noverb:  Finally,
active:  there is the
noverb:  high school manual
noverb:  This
noverb:  too
active:  ordinarily follows the beaten path
noverb:  giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters
active:  To put it bluntly
active:  we do not assume
active:  our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades
active:  mathematicians followed the same method
noverb:  high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions
active:  There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism
novoice: advanced above
active:  It is
active:  teachers have learned from bitter experience
noverb:  little history their pupils retain as
noverb:  they pass along the regular route
active:  No teacher of history will deny this
noverb:  Still
active:  it is a standing challenge
active:  to existing methods of historical instruction
active:  the study of history cannot be made truly progressive
noverb:  the study of mathematics, science, and languages
active:  the historians assume a grave responsibility
active:  adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum
active:  the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text
noverb:  more facts
noverb:  dates
noverb:  words
active:  history deserves
noverb:  of the sharp criticism
active:  it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and economics
active:  In this condition of affairs we find our justification
active:  offering a new high school text in American history
active:  Our first contribution is one of omission
passive: The time-honored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out
active:  We frankly hold
active:  pupils know little
noverb:  nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John Smith by the time
active:  they reach the high school
active:  it is useless
active:  to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time
active:  It is worse
noverb:  than useless
active:  It is an offense
noverb:  against the teachers of those subjects
passive: are demonstrated
active:  to be progressive in character
active:  In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles
active:  Our reasons for this are simple
noverb:  The strategy of a campaign
active:  of a single battle is a highly technical
noverb:  usually a highly controversial
noverb:  matter about
active:  experts differ widely
noverb:  In the field of military
noverb:  naval operations most writers
active:  teachers of history are mere novices
active:  To dispose
active:  of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs
noverb:  given
noverb:  Any one
active:  compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign with the account given by Ropes, for instance,
active:  will ask for no further comment
novoice: No youth called upon
active:  to serve our country in arms
active:  would think
active:  turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare
noverb:  The dramatic scene or episode
noverb:  so useful
active:  arousing the interest of the immature pupil
active:  seems out of place in a book
active:  deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's serious responsibilities
active:  It is not upon negative features
noverb:  however
active:  we rest our case
active:  It is rather upon constructive features
noverb:  _First
noverb:  _ We have written a topical
noverb:  not a narrative
noverb:  history
active:  We have tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of each period
active:  bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration
noverb:  _Second
noverb:  _ We have emphasized those historical topics
active:  help to explain
active:  our nation has come to be
active:  it is to-day
noverb:  _Third
noverb:  _ We have dwelt fully upon the social
noverb:  economic aspects of our history
noverb:  especially in relation to the politics of each period
noverb:  _Fourth
noverb:  _ We have treated the causes and results of wars
noverb:  the problems
active:  financing and sustaining armed forces
noverb:  rather
noverb:  military strategy
noverb:  These are the subjects
active:  belong to a history for civilians
noverb:  These are matters
active:  civilians can understand
noverb:  matters
active:  they must understand
active:  they are
noverb:  to play well their part in war and peace
noverb:  _Fifth
noverb:  _
active:  omitting the period of exploration
active:  we have been able
active:  to enlarge the treatment of our own time
active:  We have given special attention to the history of those current questions
active:  must form the subject matter of sound instruction in citizenship
noverb:  _Sixth
noverb:  _ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique characteristics,
active:  is a part of a general civilization
active:  Accordingly we have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations
noverb:  the reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place
noverb:  _Seventh
noverb:  _ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity
noverb:  The study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory
active:  We have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association, reflection, and generalization
novoice: habits calculated
active:  to enlarge
active:  inform the mind
active:  We have been at great pains
active:  to make our text clear
noverb:  , simple
noverb:  direct
active:  we have earnestly sought to stretch the intellects of our readers
active:  to put them upon their mettle
active:  of them will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
active:  The world will soon expect maturity from them
active:  Their achievements will depend upon the possession of other powers
noverb:  memory alone
passive: The effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by the excellence of their judgment
noverb:  the fullness of their information

active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation

active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And

noverb:  however long he might be

noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four

noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed

passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it

active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is

active:  save

noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet

active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties

active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare

active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign

noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license

active:  taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket
active:  It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me

novoice: even as science lost an acute reasoner
active:  he became a specialist in crime

active:  It was already dusk
noverb:  ,
passive: the lamps were just being lighted

noverb:  waiting for the coming of its occupant
active:  The house was just such as I
active:  had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description

active:  this marriage rather simplifies matters
active:  The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now
active:  The chances are
passive: she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton
active:  our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess
active:  Now the question is
active:  are we
active:  to find the photograph
noverb:  Where
noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely
active:  she carries it about with her

active:  We may take it
active:  she does not carry it about with her
noverb:  Where
noverb:  Her banker or her lawyer
active:  There is
noverb:  double possibility
passive: But I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  Women are naturally secretive
active:  they like to do their own secreting
active:  should she hand it over to anyone else
active:  She could trust her own guardianship
active:  she could not tell
noverb:  indirect
passive: political influence might be brought
active:  to bear upon a business man

active:  will you look
active:  I will not look
active:  I will get her
active:  to show me
active:  she will refuse

noverb:  It is her carriage

noverb:  As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage
active:  came round the curve of the avenue

noverb:  by the scissors-grinder
noverb:  who was equally hot
noverb:  upon the other side
passive: A blow was struck

noverb:  crowded in
active:  to help the lady
active:  to attend to the injured man
noverb:  Irene Adler
noverb:  as I will still
active:  call her
active:  had hurried up the steps

active:  They were a gang
noverb:  a rough one
noverb:  too
noverb:  Ah
active:  he's breathing now
noverb:  He can't lie in the street

active:  I do not know
passive: he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
active:  he was playing
active:  I know
noverb:  I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
active:  I saw the beautiful creature against
active:  I was conspiring
noverb:  the grace and kindliness with
active:  she waited upon the injured man
noverb:  And
active:  it would be the blackest treachery
noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought
active:  we are not injuring her
active:  We are
active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another
active:  Holmes had sat up upon the couch
active:  I saw him motion
noverb:  a man
active:  is in need of air
novoice: A maid rushed across
noverb:  threw open the window
noverb:  At the same instant I saw him raise his hand
noverb:  at the signal
active:  I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of
noverb:  Fire

noverb:  the whole crowd of spectators
noverb:  well dressed
noverb:  ill

noverb:  a moment later the voice of Holmes from

noverb:  in silence for some few minutes

active:  I know
active:  it is
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you find out
active:  She showed me
active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery
active:  said he
noverb:  laughing
active:  The matter was perfectly simple
noverb:  You, of course, saw
active:  everyone in the street was an accomplice
active:  They were all engaged for the evening
active:  I guessed as much
active:  the row broke out
active:  I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
active:  I rushed forward
noverb:  fell down
active:  clapped my hand to my face
active:  became a piteous spectacle
active:  It is an old trick
active:  also I could fathom
active:  they carried me in
passive: She was bound
active:  to have me in
active:  else could
active:  she do
noverb:  And into her sitting-room
active:  was the very room

noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled
active:  to open the window
active:  you had your chance
active:  did
active:  help you
active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a
noverb:  perfectly overpowering impulse

noverb:  also in the Arnsworth Castle business
noverb:  A married woman grabs at her baby
noverb:  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box
noverb:  Now

active:  I have not seen her
active:  I rose
active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find

noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up

novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could

active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience

active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When

noverb:  to

noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made

passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue

active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself

noverb:  we all three read it together

noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you

active:  I followed you to your door

noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one

noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From

active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary

active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour

noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all

noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects

active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique

active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications

noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain

noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all
active:  I see
active:  the other answered with the utmost coolness
active:  I fancy
active:  my pal is all right
active:  I see
active:  you have got his coat-tails
noverb:  There are three men waiting for him at the door
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem to have done the thing very completely
active:  I must compliment you
noverb:  And I you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  Your red-headed idea was very new and effective
active:  You'll see your pal again presently
active:  said Jones
active:  He's quicker
active:  climbing down holes
active:  I am
active:  Just hold out
active:  I fix the derbies
active:  I beg
active:  you will not touch me with your filthy hands
active:  remarked our prisoner
active:  the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
active:  You may not be aware
active:  I have royal blood in my veins
active:  Have the goodness, also,
active:  you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please
noverb:  All right
active:  said Jones with a stare and a snigger
noverb:  Well,
active:  would you
noverb:  sir
noverb:  march upstairs
active:  we can get a cab
active:  to carry your Highness to the police-station?
active:  That is better
active:  said John Clay serenely
active:  He made a sweeping bow to the three of us
novoice: walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  we followed them from the cellar
active:  I do not know
active:  the bank can thank you
active:  repay you
active:  There is no doubt
noverb:  that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
active:  have ever come within my experience
active:  I have had one or two little scores of my own
active:  to settle with Mr. John Clay
active:  said Holmes
active:  I have been at some small expense over this matter
active:  I shall expect the bank
active:  to refund
noverb:  beyond
passive: I am amply repaid
active:  having had an experience
active:  is in many ways unique
active:  hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street
active:  it was perfectly obvious
noverb:  from the first
noverb:  the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League
noverb:  the copying of the Encyclopaedia
active:  must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
active:  It was a curious way
active:  managing it
noverb:  , really,
active:  it would be difficult
active:  to suggest a better
active:  The method was no doubt
passive: suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair
active:  The $4 a week was a lure
active:  must draw him
active:  was it to them
active:  were playing for thousands
active:  They put in the advertisement
active:  one rogue has the temporary office
active:  the other rogue incites the man
active:  to apply for it
active:  together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
noverb:  From the time
active:  I heard
active:  of the assistant having come for half wages
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  he had some strong motive
active:  securing the situation
active:  could you guess
active:  the motive was
passive: Had
active:  there been women
noverb:  in the house
active:  I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
active:  , however, was out of the question
noverb:  The man's business was a small one
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in his house
active:  could account for such elaborate preparations
noverb:  such an expenditure
active:  they were at
active:  It must
active:  be something out of the house
active:  could it be
active:  I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography
noverb:  his trick
active:  vanishing into the cellar
noverb:  The cellar
active:  There was the end of this tangled clue
active:  Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant
active:  found
active:  I had
active:  to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London
active:  He was doing something in the cellar
noverb:  something
active:  took many hours a day for months on end
active:  could it be
noverb:  once
active:  I could think of nothing save
active:  he was running a tunnel to some other building
active:  So far I had got
active:  we went to visit the scene of action
active:  I surprised you
active:  beating upon the pavement with my stick
active:  I was ascertaining
novoice: the cellar stretched out in front
noverb:  behind
active:  It was not in front
active:  Then I rang the bell
active:  I hoped
active:  the assistant answered it
active:  We have had some skirmishes
active:  we had never set eyes upon each other before
active:  I hardly looked at his face
active:  His knees were
active:  I wished
active:  to see
noverb:  You must yourself have remarked
noverb:  worn
noverb:  wrinkled
noverb:  stained they were
noverb:  They spoke of those hours
active:  burrowing
active:  The only remaining point was
active:  they were burrowing for
active:  I walked round the corner
active:  saw the City
active:  Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises
active:  felt
active:  I had solved my problem
active:  When you drove home after the concert
active:  I called upon Scotland Yard
noverb:  upon the chairman of the bank directors
noverb:  with the result
active:  you have seen
noverb:  And
active:  could you tell
active:  they would make their attempt to-night
noverb:  ?
active:  I asked
noverb:  Well,
active:  they closed their League offices
active:  was a sign
active:  they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence
noverb:  in other words
active:  they had completed their tunnel
active:  it was essential
noverb:  that they should use it soon
passive: as it might be discovered
passive: the bullion might be removed
active:  Saturday would suit them better
noverb:  any other day
active:  as it would give them two days for their escape
active:  For all these reasons I expected them
active:  to come to-night
active:  You reasoned it out beautifully
active:  I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
active:  It is so long
noverb:  a chain
noverb:  every link rings true
active:  It saved me from ennui
active:  he answered
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Alas
active:  I already feel it closing in upon me
passive: My life is spent in one long effort
active:  to escape from the commonplaces of existence
active:  These little problems help me
active:  to do
noverb:  And
active:  you are a benefactor of the race
active:  said I.
active:  He shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  Well,
active:  perhaps, after all, it is of some little use
active:  he remarked
noverb:  L'homme c'est rien
noverb:  l'oeuvre c'est tout
active:  Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
noverb:  ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on
noverb:  side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street
active:  life is infinitely stranger
noverb:  anything
active:  the mind of man could invent
active:  We would not dare to conceive the things
active:  are really mere commonplaces of existence
active:  we could fly out of that window hand in hand
active:  hover over this great city
active:  gently remove the roofs
noverb:  peep in at the queer things
active:  are going on
noverb:  the strange coincidences
noverb:  the plannings
noverb:  the cross-purposes
noverb:  the wonderful chains of events
noverb:  working through generations
active:  leading to the most outre results
active:  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
noverb:  foreseen conclusions most stale
noverb:  unprofitable
noverb:  And
active:  I am not convinced
noverb:  of it
active:  I answered
noverb:  The cases
active:  come to light
active:  in the papers are
active:  , as a rule, bald enough
noverb:  vulgar enough
active:  We have
active:  in our police reports realism
novoice: pushed to its extreme limits
active:  the result is
passive: it must be confessed
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  artistic
passive: A certain selection and discretion must be used
active:  producing a realistic effect
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  This is wanting in the police report
passive: more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate
noverb:  upon the details
active:  to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
active:  Depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so unnatural as the commonplace
active:  I smiled and shook my head
noverb:  I can quite understand your thinking
active:  I said
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody
passive: is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
passive: you are brought in contact with all
active:  is strange and bizarre
noverb:  here
noverb:  --I picked up the morning paper from the ground--
noverb:  let us put it to a practical test
active:  Here is the first heading upon
active:  I come
noverb:  A husband's cruelty to his wife
active:  There is half a column of print
active:  I know without reading it
active:  it is all
noverb:  perfectly familiar to me
active:  There is, of course, the other woman
noverb:  the drink
noverb:  the push
noverb:  the blow
noverb:  the bruise
noverb:  the sympathetic sister or landlady
active:  The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
active:  said Holmes
active:  taking the paper
active:  glancing his eye down it
active:  This is the Dundas separation case
active:  it happens
passive: I was engaged
active:  clearing up some small points in connection with it
active:  The husband was a teetotaler
active:  there was no other woman
active:  the conduct complained
active:  was
active:  he had drifted into the habit
active:  winding up every meal
active:  taking out his false teeth
active:  hurling them at his wife
active:  you will allow
active:  is not an action likely
active:  to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller
active:  Take a pinch of snuff
noverb:  Doctor
active:  acknowledge
active:  I have scored over
noverb:  you in your example
active:  He held out his snuffbox of old gold
noverb:  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
active:  Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life
active:  I could not help
active:  commenting upon it
noverb:  Ah
active:  said he
active:  I forgot
active:  I had not seen you for some weeks
active:  It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
noverb:  And the ring
active:  I asked
active:  glancing at a remarkable brilliant
active:  sparkled upon his finger
active:  It was from the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  the matter in
active:  I served
active:  them was of such delicacy
active:  I cannot confide it even to you
active:  have been good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my little problems
active:  And have you any on hand just now
active:  I asked with interest
noverb:  Some ten
noverb:  twelve
noverb:  none
active:  present any feature of interest
active:  They are important
active:  you understand
novoice: being
active:  interesting
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I have found
active:  it is usually in unimportant matters
active:  there is a field
noverb:  for the observation
noverb:  for the quick analysis of cause and effect
active:  gives the charm to an investigation
active:  The larger crimes are apt
active:  to be the simpler
noverb:  for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive
noverb:  In these cases
noverb:  save for one rather intricate matter
passive: has been referred to me from Marseilles
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  which presents any features of interest
active:  It is possible
noverb:  , however,
active:  I may have something
active:  better
active:  very many minutes are over
active:  for this is one of my clients
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  He had risen from his chair
active:  was standing
active:  between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street
noverb:  Looking over his shoulder
active:  I saw
noverb:  on the pavement opposite
active:  there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa
active:  round her neck
noverb:  a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat
passive: was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear
noverb:  From under this great panoply
active:  she peeped up in a nervous
noverb:  hesitating fashion at our windows
active:  her body oscillated backward and forward
novoice: her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  with a plunge
noverb:  as of the swimmer
active:  leaves the bank
active:  she hurried across the road
active:  we heard the sharp clang of the bell
active:  I have seen those symptoms before
active:  said Holmes
active:  throwing his cigarette into the fire
active:  Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
active:  She would like advice
active:  is not sure
active:  the matter is not too delicate for communication
noverb:  And
noverb:  even here we may discriminate
passive: When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man
active:  she no longer oscillates
active:  the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
noverb:  Here we may take it
active:  there is a love matter
active:  the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
novoice: grieved
noverb:  here she comes in person
active:  to resolve our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was a tap
noverb:  at the door
passive: the boy in buttons entered
active:  to announce Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  the lady
active:  herself loomed behind his small black figure
noverb:  a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat
active:  Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
active:  he was remarkable
noverb:  ,
active:  having closed the door
novoice: bowed her into an armchair
active:  he looked her over in the minute
noverb:  abstracted fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  Do you not find
active:  he said
noverb:  with your short sight
active:  it is a little
active:  trying
active:  to do so much typewriting
active:  I did at first
active:  she answered
active:  now I know
active:  the letters are without looking
active:  suddenly realising the full purport of his words
active:  she gave a violent start
active:  looked up
noverb:  with fear and astonishment upon her broad
noverb:  good-humoured face
noverb:  You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes
active:  she cried
noverb:  else
active:  could you know all that
noverb:  Never mind
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  it is my business
active:  to know things
active:  Perhaps I have trained myself
active:  to see
active:  others overlook
noverb:  not
active:  should you come to consult me
active:  I came to
noverb:  you
noverb:  sir
active:  I heard of
noverb:  you from Mrs. Etherege
active:  husband you found
noverb:  easy
noverb:  the police
active:  everyone had given him up for dead
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I wish
active:  you would do as much for me
noverb:  I'm not rich
active:  still I have a hundred a year in my own right
noverb:  besides the little
active:  I make by the machine
active:  I would give it all
active:  to know
active:  has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  his eyes to the ceiling
active:  Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  Yes
active:  I did bang out of the house
active:  she said
active:  for it made me angry
active:  to see the easy way in
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  that is
noverb:  my father
active:  took it all
active:  He would not go to the police
active:  he would not go to
noverb:  you
noverb:  at last
noverb:  as he would do nothing
active:  kept
active:  saying
active:  there was no harm
passive: done
novoice: it made me mad
noverb:  I just on with my things
active:  came right away to you
noverb:  Your father
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  your stepfather, surely,
active:  the name is different
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  my stepfather
noverb:  I call him father
active:  it sounds funny, too, for
active:  he is only five years
noverb:  two months older
noverb:  than myself
active:  And your mother is alive
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  mother is alive and well
noverb:  I wasn't best pleased
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  she married again
noverb:  soon after father's death
noverb:  a man
noverb:  who was nearly fifteen years younger
noverb:  than herself
active:  Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road
active:  he left a tidy business behind him
novoice: mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman
active:  Mr. Windibank came
noverb:  he made her sell the business
noverb:  for
active:  he was very superior
noverb:  , being a traveller in wines
active:  They got $4700 for the goodwill
noverb:  interest
noverb:  wasn't near
active:  father could have got
active:  he had been alive
active:  I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient
noverb:  under this rambling
noverb:  inconsequential narrative
active:  , on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
noverb:  Your own little income
active:  he asked
active:  does it come out of the business
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  It is quite separate
noverb:  and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland
active:  It is in New Zealand stock
noverb:  paying 4 1/4 per cent
active:  Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount
active:  I can only touch the interest
active:  You interest me extremely
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And
noverb:  you draw
noverb:  large a sum as a hundred a year
noverb:  with
active:  you earn into the bargain
noverb:  you no doubt travel a little
active:  indulge yourself in every way
active:  I believe
active:  a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60
active:  I could do with much less than
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you understand
active:  I live at home I don't wish
active:  to be a burden to them
active:  they have the use of the money just
active:  I am staying with them
noverb:  Of course
active:  that is only just for the time
active:  Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
noverb:  pays it over
active:  to mother
active:  I find
active:  I can do pretty well with
active:  I earn at typewriting
noverb:  It brings me twopence a sheet
active:  I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
active:  You have made your position very clear
noverb:  to me
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  Dr. Watson
active:  you can speak
noverb:  myself
noverb:  Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face
active:  she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
noverb:  I met him first at the gasfitters' ball
active:  she said
active:  They used to send father tickets
active:  he was alive
noverb:  ,
active:  afterwards they remembered us
active:  sent them
active:  to mother
active:  Mr. Windibank did not wish us
active:  to go
active:  He never did wish us
active:  to go anywhere
active:  He would get quite mad
active:  I wanted
active:  to join a Sunday-school treat
noverb:  this time
passive: I was set on going
active:  I would go
noverb:  for
active:  right had he
active:  to prevent
active:  He said
passive: the folk were not fit for us
active:  to know
noverb:  all father's friends were to be there
active:  And he said
active:  I had nothing
active:  fit
active:  to wear
active:  I had my purple plush
active:  I had never
noverb:  taken out of the drawer
noverb:  At last
active:  nothing else would do
active:  he went off to France upon the business of the firm
active:  we went
noverb:  mother
noverb:  I, with Mr. Hardy,
active:  used to be our foreman
active:  it was there
active:  I met Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I suppose
active:  said Holmes
active:  Mr. Windibank came back from France
active:  he was very annoyed
noverb:  at your having gone to the ball
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  well
active:  he was very good
noverb:  about it
active:  He laughed
active:  I remember
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  said
active:  there was no use
active:  denying anything to a woman
noverb:  for she would have her way
active:  I see
active:  at the gasfitters' ball
active:  you met
active:  I understand
active:  a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I met him
noverb:  night
active:  he called next day to ask
active:  we had got home all safe
noverb:  after
active:  we met him
active:  that is to say
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I met him twice for walks
active:  that father came back again
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any
noverb:  No
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know father didn't
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  He wouldn't have any visitors
active:  he could help it
active:  he used to say
active:  a woman should be happy in her own family circle
noverb:  as I used
active:  to say
active:  to mother
active:  a woman wants her own circle
active:  to begin with
active:  I had not got mine
noverb:  about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Did he make no attempt
active:  to see you
noverb:  Well,
active:  father was going off to France again in a week
active:  Hosmer wrote and said
noverb:  that it would be safer and better not
active:  to see each other
active:  he had gone
active:  We could write in the meantime
active:  he used to write every day
active:  I took the letters in in the morning
active:  there was no need
noverb:  for father
active:  to know
active:  Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: We were engaged after the first walk
active:  we took
noverb:  Hosmer
noverb:  Mr. Angel
active:  was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--
noverb:  office
active:  That's the worst of it
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  I don't know
active:  Where did he live
active:  He slept on the premises
noverb:  And you don't know his address
noverb:  No
active:  it was Leadenhall Street
active:  Where did you address your letters
noverb:  To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
passive: to be left till called for
active:  He said
passive: they were sent to the office
passive: he would be chaffed by all the other clerks
active:  having letters from a lady
active:  I offered to typewrite them
noverb:  like he did his
noverb:  he wouldn't have
noverb:  for he said
active:  I wrote them
active:  they seemed
active:  to come from me
active:  they were typewritten
active:  he always felt
active:  the machine had come between us
active:  That will just show you
noverb:  fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things
active:  he would think of
active:  It was most suggestive
active:  said Holmes
active:  It has
active:  long been an axiom of mine
active:  the little things are infinitely the most important
active:  Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes
active:  He would rather walk with me in the evening
noverb:  in the daylight
noverb:  for he said
passive: he hated
active:  to be conspicuous
noverb:  Very retiring
noverb:  gentlemanly he was
active:  Even his voice was gentle
active:  He'd had the quinsy
active:  swollen glands
active:  he was young
noverb:  , he told me
active:  it had left him with a weak throat
noverb:  a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech
active:  He was always well
noverb:  dressed
noverb:  very neat and plain
active:  his eyes were weak
noverb:  just
active:  mine are
active:  he wore tinted glasses against the glare
noverb:  Well,
novoice: happened
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  your stepfather
active:  returned to France
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again
active:  proposed
active:  we should marry
active:  father came back
active:  He was in dreadful earnest
noverb:  made me swear
noverb:  with my hands on the Testament
novoice: happened
active:  I would always be true to him
active:  Mother said
active:  he was quite right
noverb:  to make me swear
active:  it was a sign of his passion
active:  Mother was all in his favour from the first
active:  was even fonder of him
active:  I was
active:  they talked
active:  marrying within the week
active:  I began
active:  to ask about father
noverb:  they
passive: said never
active:  to mind about father
noverb:  just
active:  to tell him afterwards
active:  mother said
active:  she would make it all right with him
noverb:  I didn't quite
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  It seemed funny
active:  I should ask his leave
active:  he was only a few years older
noverb:  than me
noverb:  I didn't want
active:  to do anything on the sly
active:  I wrote
active:  to father at Bordeaux
active:  the company has its French offices
active:  the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
active:  It missed him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  for he had started to England just
active:  it arrived
noverb:  Ha!
active:  was unfortunate
passive: Your wedding was arranged
noverb:  for the Friday
active:  Was it
active:  to be in church
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  very quietly
active:  It was
active:  to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross,
active:  we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel
active:  Hosmer came for us in a hansom
active:  there were two of us
active:  he put us
noverb:  into it
active:  stepped himself into a four-wheeler
active:  happened to be the only other cab in the street
active:  We got to the church first
active:  the four-wheeler drove up
active:  we waited for him
active:  to step out
active:  he never did
active:  the cabman got down from the box
active:  looked
active:  there was no one
noverb:  there
active:  The cabman said
active:  he could not imagine
active:  had become of him
noverb:  for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
active:  That was last Friday
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I have never seen or heard anything
active:  to throw any light upon
active:  became of him
active:  It seems to me
active:  you have been very shamefully treated
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  He was too good and kind
active:  to leave me
noverb:  all the morning
active:  he was saying to me
novoice: happened
active:  I was to be true
noverb:  and
noverb:  even
noverb:  something quite unforeseen occurred
active:  to separate us
active:  I was always to remember
passive: I was pledged to him
active:  he would claim his pledge sooner
noverb:  later
active:  It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning
active:  has happened
active:  gives a meaning to it
active:  Most certainly it does
active:  Your own opinion is
active:  some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I believe
active:  he foresaw some danger
active:  else he would not have talked
active:  And then I think
active:  he foresaw
novoice: happened
active:  you have no notion as to
active:  it could
passive: have been
noverb:  None
noverb:  One
noverb:  question
noverb:  did your mother take the matter
active:  She was angry
noverb:  ,
active:  said
noverb:  that I was never to speak of the matter again
noverb:  And your father
active:  Did you tell him
noverb:  Yes
active:  and he seemed
active:  to think, with me, that something
active:  had happened
active:  I should hear of Hosmer again
noverb:  As he said
noverb:  interest could anyone have
active:  bringing me to the doors of the church
active:  leaving me
noverb:  Now,
active:  he had borrowed my money
active:  he had married me
active:  got my money
novoice: settled on him
active:  there might be some reason
active:  Hosmer was very independent about money
active:  never would look at a shilling of mine
noverb:  And
active:  could have happened
noverb:  And
active:  could he not write
noverb:  Oh
active:  it drives me half-mad
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  I can't sleep a wink at night
active:  She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff
active:  began
active:  to sob heavily into it
active:  I shall glance into the case for you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  rising
active:  and I have no doubt
active:  we shall reach some definite result
active:  Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now
active:  do not let your mind
active:  dwell upon it further
noverb:  Above all
active:  try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory
active:  he has done from your life
noverb:  you don't think I'll see him again
active:  I fear not
active:  has happened to him
active:  You will leave
noverb:  question in my hands
active:  I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his
active:  you can spare
active:  I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle
active:  said she
active:  Here is the slip
active:  here are four letters from him
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And your address
noverb:  No
noverb:  31 Lyon Place
noverb:  Camberwell
noverb:  Mr. Angel's address
active:  you never had
active:  I understand
active:  Where is your father's place of business
active:  He travels for Westhouse & Marbank
noverb:  the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street
active:  Thank you
active:  You have made your statement very clearly
active:  You will leave the papers here
noverb:  ,
active:  remember the advice
active:  I have given you
active:  Let
active:  the whole incident be a sealed book
active:  do not allow it
active:  to affect your life
active:  You are very kind
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  I cannot do that
active:  I shall be true
noverb:  to Hosmer
noverb:  He shall find me ready
active:  he comes back
noverb:  For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face
active:  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor
active:  compelled our respect
active:  She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table
active:  went her way
noverb:  with a promise
active:  to come again
passive: she might be summoned
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
passive: pressed together
novoice: his legs stretched out in front of him
noverb:  his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
active:  he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe
active:  was to him as a counsellor
active:  having lit it
active:  he leaned back in his chair
noverb:  with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him
noverb:  a look of infinite languor in his face
noverb:  Quite an interesting study
noverb:  that maiden
active:  he observed
active:  I found her more interesting
noverb:  her little problem
active:  , by the way, is rather a trite one
active:  You will find parallel cases
active:  you consult my index
noverb:  in Andover in '77
active:  there was something
noverb:  of the sort at The Hague last year
noverb:  Old
active:  is the idea, however,
active:  there were one or two details
active:  were new to me
noverb:  the maiden
active:  herself was most instructive
active:  You appeared to read a good deal upon her
active:  was quite invisible to me
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not invisible
noverb:  unnoticed
noverb:  Watson
active:  You did not know
active:  to look
active:  you missed all
active:  was important
active:  I can never bring you
active:  to realise the importance of sleeves
noverb:  the suggestiveness of thumb-nails
noverb:  the great issues
active:  may hang from a boot-lace
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  did you gather from that woman's appearance
active:  Describe it
noverb:  Well,
active:  she had a slate-coloured
noverb:  broad-brimmed straw hat
noverb:  with a feather of a brickish red
active:  Her jacket was black
noverb:  with black beads sewn upon it
noverb:  a fringe of little black jet ornaments
active:  Her dress was brown
noverb:  rather darker
active:  coffee colour
noverb:  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
active:  Her gloves were greyish
passive: were worn through at the right forefinger
noverb:  Her boots I didn't observe
active:  She had small round
noverb:  hanging gold earrings
noverb:  a general air
novoice: being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way
active:  Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together
novoice: chuckled
noverb:  Pon my word
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are coming along wonderfully
active:  You have really done very well indeed
active:  It is true
noverb:  that you have missed everything of importance
active:  you have hit upon the method
active:  you have a quick eye for colour
active:  Never trust
active:  to general impressions
noverb:  my boy
active:  concentrate yourself upon details
active:  My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve
noverb:  In a man
active:  it is perhaps better first
active:  to take the knee of the trouser
active:  you observe
active:  this woman had plush upon her sleeves
active:  is a most useful material for showing traces
active:  The double line a little above the wrist
noverb:  the typewritist presses against the table
passive: was beautifully defined
active:  The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark
noverb:  only on the left arm
noverb:  on the side of it farthest from the thumb
noverb:  instead
active:  being right across the broadest part
active:  this was
noverb:  I
novoice: glanced at her face
active:  observing the dint of a pince-nez at
noverb:  side of her nose
active:  I ventured a remark upon short sight
noverb:  typewriting
active:  seemed to surprise her
active:  It surprised me
noverb:  , surely,
active:  it was obvious
active:  I was
noverb:  much surprised
novoice: interested
active:  glancing down
active:  to observe
noverb:  the boots
active:  she was wearing
active:  were not unlike each other
active:  they were really odd ones
active:  the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap
noverb:  the other a plain one
passive: One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
noverb:  the other at the first, third
noverb:  fifth
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  a young lady
noverb:  neatly dressed
active:  has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned
active:  it is no great deduction
active:  to say
active:  she came away in a hurry
noverb:  And
noverb:  else
active:  I asked
noverb:  keenly interested
noverb:  as I always was
noverb:  by my friend's incisive reasoning
active:  I noted, in passing,
active:  she had written a note
noverb:  leaving home
passive: being fully dressed
active:  You observed
passive: her right glove was torn at the forefinger
active:  you did not apparently see
noverb:  glove
passive: finger were stained with violet ink
active:  She had written in a hurry
active:  dipped her pen too deep
active:  It must have been this morning
active:  the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
noverb:  All this is amusing
noverb:  rather elementary
active:  I must go back to business
noverb:  Watson
active:  Would you mind
noverb:  reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I held the little
active:  printed slip to the light
noverb:  Missing
active:  it said
noverb:  on the morning of the fourteenth
active:  a gentleman named Hosmer Angel
noverb:  About five ft
noverb:  seven in
noverb:  in height
noverb:  strongly built
noverb:  sallow complexion
noverb:  black hair
active:  a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers
noverb:  moustache
noverb:  tinted glasses
noverb:  slight infirmity of speech
passive: Was dressed
noverb:  last seen
noverb:  in black frock-coat faced with silk
noverb:  black waistcoat
noverb:  gold Albert chain
noverb:  grey Harris tweed trousers
noverb:  with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots
active:  Known
passive: to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street
noverb:  Anybody bringing
active:  That will do
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  As to the letters
active:  he continued
active:  glancing over them
active:  they are very commonplace
noverb:  Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel
noverb:  save
active:  he quotes Balzac once
active:  There is one remarkable point, however,
active:  will no doubt strike you
active:  They are typewritten
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not only
active:  the signature is typewritten
noverb:  Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom
active:  There is a date
noverb:  you see
noverb:  no superscription
noverb:  Leadenhall Street
active:  is rather vague
active:  The point about the signature is very suggestive
noverb:  in fact
active:  we may call it conclusive
noverb:  Of
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  is it possible you do not see
noverb:  strongly it bears upon the case
active:  I cannot say
active:  I do
active:  it were
active:  he wished to be able
active:  to deny his signature
passive: an action for breach of promise were instituted
noverb:  No
active:  that was not the point
noverb:  However,
active:  I shall write two letters
active:  should settle the matter
active:  One is to a firm in the City
active:  the other is
active:  to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him
noverb:  he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening
active:  It is just as well
active:  we should do business with the male relatives
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we can do nothing until the answers to those letters
active:  come
active:  we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
active:  I had had so many reasons
active:  to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning
noverb:  extraordinary energy in action
active:  I felt
active:  he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with
active:  he treated the singular mystery
passive: he had been called upon
active:  to fathom
active:  Once only had I known him
active:  to fail
noverb:  in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph
active:  I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four
novoice: the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet
active:  I felt
active:  it would be a strange tangle indeed
active:  he could not unravel
active:  I left him
active:  still puffing at his black clay pipe
noverb:  with the conviction
active:  I came again on the next evening
active:  I would find
active:  he held in his hands all the clues
active:  would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
active:  A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time
noverb:  the whole of next day
active:  I was busy
noverb:  at the bedside of the sufferer
active:  It was not until close upon six o'clock
active:  I found myself free
active:  was able
active:  to spring into a hansom
noverb:  drive to Baker Street
noverb:  half afraid
active:  I might be too late
active:  to assist at the denouement of the little mystery
active:  I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
noverb:  A formidable array of bottles
noverb:  test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me
active:  he had spent his day in the chemical work
active:  was so dear to him
noverb:  Well,
passive: have
active:  you solved it
active:  I asked
active:  I entered
noverb:  Yes
active:  It was the bisulphate of baryta
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the mystery
active:  I cried
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  that
active:  I thought of the salt
active:  I have been working upon
active:  There was never any mystery
noverb:  in the matter, though, as I said yesterday
active:  some of the details are of interest
active:  The only drawback is
active:  there is no law
active:  I fear
active:  that can touch the scoundrel
active:  was he
active:  was his object
active:  deserting Miss Sutherland
active:  The question was hardly out of my mouth
active:  Holmes had not yet opened his lips
active:  to reply
active:  we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
active:  This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  He has written to me
active:  to say
active:  he would be here
noverb:  at six
active:  Come in
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a sturdy
noverb:  middle-sized fellow
noverb:  some thirty years of age, clean-shaven
noverb:  sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner
noverb:  a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
active:  He shot a questioning glance at each of us
active:  placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard
novoice: with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
noverb:  Good-evening
noverb:  Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  this typewritten letter is from
noverb:  you
noverb:  in
active:  you made an appointment with me for six o'clock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am a little late
active:  I am not quite my own master
active:  you know
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter
noverb:  for I think
novoice: it is far
noverb:  better not
active:  to wash linen of the sort in public
active:  It was quite against my wishes
active:  she came
active:  she is a very excitable, impulsive girl
noverb:  as you may have noticed
passive: she is not easily controlled
active:  she has made up her mind on a point
noverb:  Of course
active:  I did not mind you
noverb:  much
passive: you are not connected with the official police
active:  it is not pleasant
noverb:  to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is a useless expense
noverb:  for
active:  could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  I will succeed
active:  discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Mr. Windibank gave a violent start
active:  dropped his gloves
passive: I am delighted
active:  to hear it
active:  he said
active:  It is a curious thing
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting
active:  they are quite new
noverb:  , no two of them write exactly alike
active:  Some letters get more worn
noverb:  others
noverb:  some wear only on one side
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you remark in this note of yours
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  in every case
active:  there is some little
active:  slurring over of the 'e
noverb:  a slight defect in the tail of the 'r
active:  There are fourteen other characteristics
noverb:  those are the more obvious
active:  We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it is a little worn
active:  our visitor answered
active:  glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
active:  And now I will show you
active:  is really a very interesting study
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Holmes continued
active:  I think
active:  writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation
active:  to crime
active:  It is a subject to
active:  I have devoted some little attention
active:  I have here four letters
active:  purport
active:  to come from the missing man
active:  They are all
active:  typewritten
noverb:  In each case
active:  not only are the 'e's' slurred
noverb:  the 'r's' tailless
active:  you will observe
noverb:  you care
noverb:  to use my magnifying lens
noverb:  the fourteen other characteristics to
active:  I have alluded
active:  are there as well
active:  Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair
active:  picked up his hat
active:  I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes
active:  he said
active:  you can catch the man
active:  catch him
noverb:  let me know
active:  you have done it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  said Holmes
active:  stepping over
active:  turning the key in the door
active:  I let
active:  you know
active:  I have caught him
noverb:  !
noverb:  shouted Mr. Windibank
noverb:  turning white to his lips
active:  glancing about him like a rat in a trap
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  it won't do
noverb:  really it won't
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  There is no possible
active:  getting out of it, Mr. Windibank
active:  It is quite too transparent
active:  it was a very bad compliment
active:  you said
active:  it was impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to solve
noverb:  simple a question
active:  That's right
active:  Sit down
noverb:  let us talk it over
active:  Our visitor collapsed into a chair
noverb:  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
noverb:  It
active:  it's not actionable
active:  he stammered
active:  I am very much
noverb:  afraid
active:  it is not
noverb:  between ourselves
noverb:  Windibank
active:  it was as cruel
noverb:  selfish
noverb:  heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came
noverb:  me
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  let me just run over the course of events
active:  you will contradict me
active:  I go wrong
active:  The man sat huddled up in his chair
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  like one
passive: is utterly crushed
active:  Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece
noverb:  leaning back with his hands in his pockets
active:  began talking
noverb:  rather to himself
novoice: it seemed
noverb:  to us
active:  The man married a woman very much older
noverb:  himself for her money
active:  said he
active:  and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter
active:  she lived with them
active:  It was a considerable sum
noverb:  for people in their position
active:  the loss of it would have made a serious difference
active:  It was worth
noverb:  an effort
active:  to preserve it
active:  The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition
noverb:  affectionate
noverb:  warm-hearted in her ways
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that with her fair personal advantages
noverb:  her little income
passive: she would not be allowed
active:  to remain single long
active:  Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year
active:  does her stepfather
active:  do to prevent it
active:  He takes the obvious course
active:  keeping her at home
active:  forbidding her
active:  to seek the company of people of her own age
active:  soon he found
active:  that would not answer forever
active:  She became restive
novoice: insisted upon her rights
active:  finally announced her positive intention
active:  going to a certain ball
active:  does her clever stepfather
active:  do
active:  He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
noverb:  than to his heart
active:  With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
active:  covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses
active:  masked the face with a moustache
noverb:  a pair of bushy whiskers
noverb:  sunk
noverb:  clear voice into an insinuating whisper
active:  doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight
active:  he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  keeps off other lovers by making love himself
active:  It was only a joke
noverb:  at first
active:  groaned our visitor
active:  We never thought
active:  she would have been
novoice: carried away
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  However that may be
active:  the young lady was very decidedly carried away
active:  having quite made up her mind
active:  her stepfather was in France
noverb:  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind
passive: She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions
passive: the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
active:  Then Mr. Angel began
active:  to call
active:  for it was obvious
noverb:  that the matter should be pushed
active:  it would go
active:  a real effect were to be produced
active:  There were meetings
noverb:  ,
noverb:  an engagement
active:  would finally secure the girl's affections
active:  turning towards anyone else
passive: the deception could not be kept up forever
active:  These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous
noverb:  The thing
active:  to do
active:  was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner
active:  it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind
active:  prevent her
active:  looking upon any other suitor for some time
active:  to come
active:  Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament
noverb:  hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
active:  James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland
active:  to be
novoice: bound to Hosmer Angel
noverb:  so uncertain as to his fate
noverb:  for ten years
active:  to come, at any rate,
active:  she would not listen to another man
noverb:  the church door
active:  he brought her
noverb:  as he could go no farther
noverb:  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
active:  stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler
noverb:  out at the other
active:  I think
active:  was the chain of events
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance
active:  Holmes had been talking
active:  he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
active:  It may be
active:  it may not
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  you are
noverb:  very sharp you ought to be sharp enough
active:  to know
active:  it is you
active:  are breaking the law now
noverb:  not me
active:  I have done nothing actionable from the first
noverb:  ,
noverb:  you keep
active:  door locked
noverb:  you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
active:  The law cannot
active:  you say
active:  touch you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  unlocking and throwing open the door
noverb:  yet
active:  there never was a man
noverb:  who deserved punishment
active:  the young lady has a brother or a friend
active:  he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
noverb:  By Jove
active:  he continued
active:  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face
active:  it is not part of my duties
noverb:  to my client
noverb:  here's a hunting crop handy
noverb:  ,
active:  I think
active:  I shall just treat myself to
active:  He took two swift steps to the whip
active:  he could grasp it
active:  there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
novoice: the heavy hall door banged
noverb:  from the window
active:  we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
active:  There's a cold-blooded scoundrel
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  he threw himself down into his chair once
active:  That fellow will rise from crime to crime
active:  he does something very bad
noverb:  ,
noverb:  ends on a gallows
active:  The case has
active:  , in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest
active:  I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  of course
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct
active:  it was equally clear
noverb:  that the only man
passive: really profited by the incident
active:  we could see
active:  was the stepfather
noverb:  the fact
active:  the two men were never together
novoice: the one always appeared
active:  the other was away
active:  was suggestive
active:  So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
novoice: hinted at a disguise
active:  did the bushy whiskers
active:  My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action
active:  typewriting his signature
active:  , of course, inferred
active:  his handwriting was so familiar to her
active:  she would recognise even the smallest sample of it
active:  You see all these isolated facts
noverb:  together with many minor ones
noverb:  all pointed in the same direction
noverb:  And
active:  did you verify them
active:  Having once spotted my man
active:  it was easy
active:  to get corroboration
active:  I knew the firm for
active:  this man worked
active:  Having taken the printed description
active:  I eliminated everything from it
active:  could be the result of a disguise
noverb:  the whiskers, the glasses, the voice
active:  I sent it to the firm
noverb:  with a request
active:  they would inform me
active:  it answered to the description of any of their travellers
active:  I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter
noverb:  I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him
active:  he would come here
active:  As I expected
active:  his reply was typewritten
active:  revealed the same trivial
noverb:  characteristic defects
noverb:  The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street,
active:  to say
active:  the description tallied in every respect with
noverb:  of their employe, James Windibank
noverb:  Voila tout
noverb:  And Miss Sutherland
noverb:  I tell her she will not believe me
active:  You may remember the old Persian
active:  saying
active:  There is danger
noverb:  for him
noverb:  taketh the tiger cub
noverb:  danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman
active:  There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace
noverb:  as much knowledge of the world
noverb:  ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
passive: We were seated at breakfast one morning
noverb:  my wife and I
active:  the maid brought in a telegram
active:  It was from Sherlock Holmes
active:  ran in this way
active:  Have you a couple of days
active:  to spare
passive: Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy
active:  Shall be glad
active:  you will come with me
noverb:  Air and scenery perfect
noverb:  Leave Paddington by the 11
noverb:  15
active:  do you say
noverb:  dear
active:  said
noverb:  my wife
noverb:  looking across at me
active:  Will you go
noverb:  I really don't know
active:  to say
active:  I have a fairly long list at present
noverb:  Oh
active:  Anstruther would do your work for you
active:  You have been looking a little pale lately
active:  I think
noverb:  the change would do you good
active:  you are always
noverb:  interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases
active:  I should be ungrateful
noverb:  if I were not
noverb:  seeing
active:  I gained through one of them
active:  I answered
active:  I am to go
active:  I must pack at once
noverb:  for I have only half an hour
active:  My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
noverb:  making me a prompt and ready traveller
active:  My wants were few and simple
noverb:  in less than the time stated
active:  I was in a cab with my valise
noverb:  rattling away to Paddington Station
active:  Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform
noverb:  his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter
noverb:  taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap
active:  It is really very good
noverb:  of you
active:  to come
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes a considerable difference to me
active:  having someone with me on
active:  I can thoroughly rely
active:  Local aid is always
noverb:  worthless
novoice: else biassed
active:  you will keep the two corner seats
active:  I shall get the tickets
noverb:  We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers

noverb:  from

active:  are
noverb:  extremely difficult

active:  I remarked

active:  it does
noverb:  here
active:  Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing
active:  answered Holmes thoughtfully
active:  It may seem to point very straight to one thing
noverb:  you shift your own point of view a little
active:  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
passive: It must be confessed, however,
active:  the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man

active:  two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
active:  I am afraid
active:  said I
active:  the facts are so obvious
active:  you will find little credit
passive: to be gained out of this case
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more deceptive
noverb:  an obvious fact
active:  he answered
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Besides
active:  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
active:  may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade
active:  You know me too well
active:  to think
active:  I am boasting
active:  I say
active:  I shall
active:  confirm or destroy his theory by means
active:  he is quite incapable
noverb:  of employing
noverb:  even of understanding
active:  To take the first example
active:  to hand
noverb:  I very clearly perceive
active:  in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side
active:  I question
active:  Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  I know you well
active:  I know the military neatness
noverb:  characterises you
active:  You shave every morning
noverb:  in this season you shave by the sunlight
active:  your shaving is less and less complete

noverb:  that that side is less illuminated
noverb:  the other

active:  looking at himself in an equal light
passive: being satisfied with such a result

noverb:  us
active:  There are one or two minor points

active:  considering

active:  he was a prisoner
active:  he remarked
passive: he was not surprised
active:  to hear it
active:  it was no more than his deserts
noverb:  This observation of his had the natural effect
active:  removing any traces of doubt
active:  might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
active:  It was a confession
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  No
passive: for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
noverb:  Coming on the top of such a damning series of events
active:  it was at least a most suspicious remark
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes
active:  it is the brightest rift
noverb:  which I can at present see in the clouds
noverb:  However innocent he might be
active:  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not
active:  to see
active:  the circumstances were very black against him
active:  Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest
noverb:  feigned indignation at it
active:  I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious
noverb:  such surprise
active:  anger would not be natural under the circumstances
active:  might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
active:  His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
noverb:  an innocent man
noverb:  else as a man of considerable self-restraint
noverb:  firmness
noverb:  As to his remark about his deserts
active:  it was also not unnatural
noverb:  if you consider
active:  he stood beside the dead body of his father
active:  there is no doubt
noverb:  that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as
active:  to bandy words with him
noverb:  even
noverb:  according to the little girl
active:  evidence is so important
active:  to raise his hand as
active:  to strike him
noverb:  The self-reproach
noverb:  contrition
passive: are displayed
active:  in his remark appear to me
active:  to be the signs of a healthy mind rather
noverb:  of a guilty one
active:  I shook my head
passive: Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence
active:  I remarked
active:  they have
passive: And many men have been wrongfully hanged
active:  is the young man's own account of the matter
active:  It is
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , not very encouraging to his supporters
active:  there are one or two points in it
active:  are suggestive
noverb:  You will find it here
active:  may read it for yourself
active:  He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper
active:  having turned down the sheet
active:  he pointed out the paragraph in
active:  the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of

active:  read
noverb:  it very carefully

active:  On my way I saw William Crowder
noverb:  the game-keeper
active:  he had stated in his evidence
passive: he is mistaken
active:  thinking
active:  I was following my father
active:  I had no idea
active:  he was in front of me
active:  When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of
noverb:  Cooee
active:  was a usual signal between my father and myself
noverb:  I
noverb:  hurried forward
active:  found him standing by the pool
active:  He appeared
passive: to be much surprised
active:  seeing me
active:  asked me rather roughly
active:  I was doing there
active:  A conversation ensued
active:  led to high words
noverb:  almost to blows
active:  for my father was a man of a very violent temper
active:  Seeing
active:  his passion was becoming ungovernable
active:  I left him
active:  returned towards Hatherley Farm
active:  I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
active:  I heard a hideous outcry behind me
active:  caused me
active:  to run back again
active:  I found
active:  my father expiring upon the ground
noverb:  with his head terribly injured
active:  I dropped my gun
active:  held him in my arms
noverb:  he almost
noverb:  expired
active:  I knelt beside him for some minutes
active:  made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper
novoice: his house being the nearest
active:  to ask for assistance
active:  I saw no one near my father
active:  I returned
active:  I have no idea
active:  he came by his injuries
active:  He was not a popular man
active:  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners
active:  he had
active:  I know
noverb:  no active enemies
active:  I know nothing further of the matter
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  Did your father make any statement to you
active:  he died
noverb:  Witness
active:  He mumbled a few words
active:  I could only catch some allusion to a rat
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  did you understand by that
noverb:  Witness
active:  It conveyed no meaning to me
active:  I thought
active:  he was delirious
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was the point upon
noverb:  you
active:  your father had this final quarrel
noverb:  Witness
active:  I should prefer not
active:  to answer
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must press it
noverb:  Witness
active:  It is really impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to tell you
active:  I can assure you
active:  it has nothing
active:  to do with the sad tragedy
active:  followed
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  That is for the court
active:  to decide
active:  I need
active:  not point out to you
noverb:  your refusal
active:  to answer
active:  will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings
active:  may arise
noverb:  Witness
active:  I must still refuse
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I understand
noverb:  the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
noverb:  Witness
active:  It was
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was it
active:  he uttered it
active:  he saw you
active:  he even knew
active:  you had returned from Bristol
noverb:  Witness (with considerable confusion)
active:  I do not know
noverb:  A Juryman
active:  Did you see nothing
active:  aroused your suspicions
active:  you returned
active:  hearing the cry
noverb:  found your father fatally injured
noverb:  Witness
noverb:  Nothing definite
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  do you mean
noverb:  Witness
active:  I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open
active:  I could think of nothing
noverb:  of my father
active:  Yet I have a vague impression
active:  I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
active:  It seemed to me
active:  to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort,
noverb:  a plaid perhaps
active:  When I rose from my father
active:  I looked round for it
passive: it was gone
active:  Do you mean
active:  it disappeared
active:  you went for help
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was gone
active:  You cannot say
active:  it was
noverb:  No
active:  I had
active:  a feeling something was there
noverb:  far from the body
noverb:  A dozen yards
noverb:  And
noverb:  far from the edge of the wood
noverb:  About the same
passive: it was removed
active:  it was
active:  you were within a dozen yards of it
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  with my back towards it
noverb:  This concluded the examination of the witness
active:  I see
active:  said I
active:  I glanced down the column
active:  the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy
active:  He calls attention
noverb:  with reason
active:  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him
active:  seeing him
noverb:  also to his refusal
active:  to give details of his conversation with his father
noverb:  his singular account of his father's dying words
active:  They are all
noverb:  , as he remarks
noverb:  very much against the son
active:  Holmes laughed softly to himself
active:  stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
noverb:  you
active:  the coroner have been at some pains
active:  said he
active:  to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
noverb:  Don't you see
noverb:  you alternately give him credit
active:  having too much imagination
noverb:  too little
noverb:  Too little
active:  he could not invent a cause of quarrel
noverb:  would give him the sympathy of the jury
noverb:  too much
active:  he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat
noverb:  the incident of the vanishing cloth
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I shall approach this case from the point of view
active:  this young man says
active:  is true
active:  we shall see whither
active:  hypothesis will lead us
active:  And now here is my pocket Petrarch
noverb:  not another word shall I say of this case
active:  we are on the scene of action
active:  We lunch at Swindon
active:  I see
active:  we shall be there
noverb:  in twenty minutes
active:  It was nearly four
noverb:  o'clock
noverb:  we at last
active:  passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley
noverb:  over the broad gleaming Severn
active:  found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross
noverb:  A lean, ferret-like man
noverb:  furtive
noverb:  sly-looking
active:  was waiting for us upon the platform
noverb:  In spite of the light brown dustcoat
noverb:  leather-leggings
active:  he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  recognising Lestrade
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
active:  With him we drove to the Hereford Arms
passive: a room had already been engaged for us
active:  I have ordered a carriage
active:  said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
active:  I knew your energetic nature
active:  you would not be happy
active:  you had been on the scene of the crime
active:  It was very nice and complimentary of you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
active:  Lestrade looked startled
active:  I do not quite follow
active:  he said
active:  is the glass
noverb:  Twenty-nine
active:  I see
noverb:  No wind
noverb:  not a cloud in the sky
active:  I have a caseful of cigarettes here
active:  need smoking
active:  the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
active:  I do not think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that I shall use the carriage to-night
active:  Lestrade laughed indulgently
active:  You have
noverb:  no doubt
active:  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
active:  he said
active:  The case is
noverb:  a pikestaff
noverb:  the more one goes into it the plainer
active:  it becomes
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
noverb:  one can't refuse a lady
noverb:  such a very positive one
noverb:  too
active:  She has heard of
noverb:  you
active:  would have your opinion
novoice: I repeatedly told her
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  which you could do
active:  I had not already done
active:  bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door
active:  He had hardly spoken
active:  there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women
active:  I have
noverb:  seen in my life
noverb:  Her violet eyes shining
noverb:  her lips parted
noverb:  a pink flush upon her cheeks
active:  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  she cried
active:  glancing from one to the other of us
noverb:  finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion
active:  I am so glad
noverb:  that you have come
active:  I have driven down
active:  to tell you
active:  I know
noverb:  James didn't do it
active:  I know it
active:  I want you
active:  to start
active:  upon your work knowing it
noverb:  too
noverb:  Never let yourself doubt upon
noverb:  point
active:  We have known each other
active:  we were little children
active:  I know his faults as no one else
active:  does
active:  he is too tender-hearted
active:  to hurt a fly
active:  Such a charge is absurd to anyone
active:  really knows him
active:  I hope
active:  we may clear him, Miss Turner
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  You may rely upon my doing all
active:  I can
active:  you have read the evidence
active:  You have formed some conclusion
active:  Do you not see some loophole, some flaw
noverb:  Do you not yourself think
active:  he is innocent
active:  I think
active:  it is very probable
noverb:  There
noverb:  now
active:  she cried
active:  throwing
active:  back her head
noverb:  looking defiantly at Lestrade
active:  You hear
noverb:  He gives me hopes
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that my colleague has been a little quick
active:  forming his conclusions
active:  he said
active:  he is right
noverb:  Oh
active:  I know
active:  he is right
active:  James never did it
noverb:  And about his quarrel with his father
active:  I am sure
noverb:  the reason
active:  he would not speak
active:  about it to the coroner was
passive: I was concerned in
noverb:  it
noverb:  In
noverb:  way
active:  asked Holmes
active:  It is no time for me
active:  to hide anything
noverb:  James
active:  his father had many disagreements about me
active:  Mr. McCarthy was very anxious
active:  there should be a marriage
noverb:  between us
noverb:  James
active:  I have always loved each other as brother and sister
noverb:  of course
active:  he is young
noverb:  and has seen very little of life
noverb:  --and--well
active:  he naturally did not wish to do anything like
active:  there were quarrels
noverb:  this
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , was one of them
noverb:  And your father
active:  asked Holmes
active:  Was he in favour of such a union
noverb:  No
active:  he was averse
noverb:  to it also
noverb:  No one
active:  Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it
active:  A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen
active:  questioning glances at her
active:  Thank you for this information
active:  said he
active:  May I see your father
noverb:  I call to-morrow
noverb:  ?
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  the doctor won't allow it
noverb:  The doctor
noverb:  Yes
active:  have you not heard
active:  Poor father has never been strong for years back
active:  this has broken him down completely
active:  He has taken to his bed
active:  Dr. Willows says
noverb:  that he is a wreck
passive: his nervous system is shattered
active:  Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
noverb:  who had known dad in the old days in Victoria
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  In Victoria
active:  That is important
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  at the mines
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  at the gold-mines
active:  I understand
active:  Mr. Turner made his money
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  certainly
active:  Thank you, Miss Turner
active:  You have been of material assistance to me
active:  You will tell me
active:  you have any news to-morrow
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you will go to the prison
active:  to see James
noverb:  Oh
active:  you do
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  do tell him
active:  I know him
active:  to be innocent
active:  I will
noverb:  Miss Turner
active:  I must go home now
active:  for dad is very ill
active:  he misses me
active:  I leave him
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  God help you in your undertaking
active:  She hurried from the room
active:  she had entered
active:  we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
active:  I am ashamed
noverb:  of you, Holmes
active:  said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
active:  should you raise up hopes
passive: you are bound
active:  to disappoint
active:  I am not over-tender
noverb:  of heart
active:  I call it cruel
active:  I think
active:  I see my way
active:  to clearing James McCarthy
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Have you an order
active:  to see him in prison
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only for you and me
active:  I shall reconsider my resolution
active:  going out
active:  We have
active:  still time to take a train to Hereford
active:  see him to-night?
noverb:  Ample
noverb:  let us do
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
active:  you will find it very slow
active:  I shall only be away a couple of hours
active:  I walked down to the station with them
novoice: wandered through the streets of the little town
active:  finally returning to the hotel
active:  I lay upon the sofa
active:  tried
active:  to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel
active:  The puny plot of the story was so thin
noverb:  however
passive: compared to the deep mystery through
active:  we were groping
active:  I found
active:  my attention wander
noverb:  continually from the action to the fact
noverb:  I at last flung it across the room
active:  gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
noverb:  Supposing
active:  this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true
noverb:  hellish thing
noverb:  absolutely unforeseen
active:  extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time
active:  he parted from his father
noverb:  the moment
noverb:  drawn back by his screams
active:  he rushed into the glade
active:  It was something
noverb:  terrible and deadly
active:  could it be
active:  Might not the nature of the injuries
active:  reveal something to my medical instincts
active:  I rang the bell
active:  called for the weekly county paper
active:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest
passive: In the surgeon's deposition it was stated
noverb:  the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone
passive: had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
active:  I marked the spot upon my own head
passive: Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
active:  That was to some extent in favour of the accused
noverb:  as
noverb:  seen quarrelling
active:  he was face to face
noverb:  with his father
noverb:  Still,
active:  it did not go for very much
active:  for the older man might have turned his back
active:  the blow fell
noverb:  Still,
active:  it might be worth
noverb:  while
active:  to call Holmes' attention to it
active:  there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
active:  could
noverb:  mean
active:  It could not be delirium
noverb:  A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
noverb:  No
active:  it was more
noverb:  likely
active:  to be an attempt
active:  to explain
active:  he met his fate
active:  could it indicate
active:  I cudgelled my brains
active:  to find some possible explanation
active:  And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy
active:  were true the murderer
active:  must have dropped some part of his dress
noverb:  presumably his overcoat, in his flight,
active:  must have had the hardihood
active:  to return
active:  to carry it away at the instant
active:  the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
noverb:  a tissue of mysteries
noverb:  improbabilities the whole thing was
active:  I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion
active:  I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight
active:  I could not lose hope
novoice: every fresh fact seemed
active:  to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence
active:  It was late
active:  Sherlock Holmes returned
active:  He came back alone
active:  for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
noverb:  The glass still keeps very high
active:  he remarked as
active:  he sat down
active:  It is of importance
active:  it should not rain
active:  we are able
active:  to go over the ground
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  a man should be at his very best
noverb:  keenest for such nice work as
active:  I did not wish to do it
novoice: fagged by a long journey
active:  I have seen young McCarthy
noverb:  And
active:  did you learn from him
noverb:  Nothing
active:  Could he throw no light
noverb:  None at all
passive: I was inclined
active:  to think at one time
active:  he knew
active:  had done it
active:  was screening him
noverb:  her
passive: I am convinced now
active:  he is
noverb:  everyone else
active:  He is not a very quick-witted youth
noverb:  comely
active:  to look at
active:  I should think
noverb:  sound at heart
active:  I cannot admire his taste
active:  I remarked
active:  it is indeed a fact
noverb:  that he was averse
noverb:  to a marriage with
active:  charming a young lady as this Miss Turner
noverb:  Ah
active:  thereby hangs a rather painful tale
active:  This fellow is madly
noverb:  insanely
noverb:  in love with her
noverb:  some two years ago
active:  he was only a lad
active:  he really knew her
noverb:  for she had been away five years at a boarding-school
active:  does the idiot
active:  do
active:  get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol
active:  marry her at a registry office
active:  No one knows a word of the matter
active:  you can imagine
active:  maddening
active:  it must be to him
active:  to be upbraided for not doing
active:  he would give his very eyes
active:  to do
active:  he knows to be absolutely impossible
active:  It was sheer frenzy of this sort
noverb:  made him throw his hands up into the air
active:  his father, at their last interview, was goading him on
active:  to propose to Miss Turner
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he had no means
active:  supporting himself
noverb:  his father
active:  was by all accounts a very hard man
active:  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
active:  It was with his barmaid wife
active:  he had spent the last three days in Bristol
active:  his father did not know
active:  he was
noverb:  Mark
active:  point
active:  It is of importance
active:  Good has come out of evil
noverb:  however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
active:  he is in serious trouble
noverb:  likely
passive: to be hanged
active:  has thrown him over utterly
active:  has written to him
active:  to say
active:  she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
active:  there is really no tie
noverb:  between them
active:  I think
active:  bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
active:  he has suffered
active:  he is innocent
noverb:  ,
active:  has done it
noverb:  Ah!
active:  I would call your attention very particularly to two points
active:  One is
active:  the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool
active:  the someone could not have been his son
active:  for his son was away
active:  he did not know
active:  he would return
active:  The second is
passive: the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee
active:  he knew
active:  his son had returned
noverb:  Those are the crucial points upon
active:  the case depends
noverb:  And now let us talk about George Meredith
noverb:  you
active:  we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
active:  There was no rain
active:  Holmes had foretold
noverb:  the morning broke bright
noverb:  cloudless
noverb:  At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage
active:  we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
active:  There is serious news this morning
active:  Lestrade observed
active:  It is said
active:  Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill
passive: his life is despaired of
noverb:  An elderly man
active:  I presume
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  About sixty
passive: his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad
active:  he has been in failing health for some time
active:  This business has had a very bad effect upon him
active:  He was an old friend of McCarthy's
active:  I may add
noverb:  a great benefactor to him
noverb:  for I have learned
noverb:  he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is interesting
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  In a hundred other ways
active:  he has helped him
noverb:  Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
noverb:  Really
active:  Does it not strike you as a little singular
noverb:  this McCarthy
active:  appears to have had little of his own
active:  to have been under such obligations to Turner
active:  should still talk
active:  marrying his son to Turner's daughter
active:  is
noverb:  presumably
noverb:  heiress to the estate
noverb:  in such a very cocksure manner
noverb:  as
active:  it were merely a case of a proposal
noverb:  and all else would follow
active:  It is the
noverb:  more strange
active:  we know that Turner
active:  himself was averse
noverb:  to the idea
active:  The daughter told us as much
active:  Do you not deduce something from that
active:  We have got to the deductions and the inferences
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  winking at me
active:  I find it hard enough
active:  to tackle facts
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  without flying away after theories and fancies
active:  You are right
active:  said Holmes demurely
active:  you do find it very hard
active:  to tackle the facts
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  I have grasped one fact
active:  you seem to find it difficult
active:  to get hold of
active:  replied Lestrade with some warmth
noverb:  And
active:  is
active:  That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior
active:  all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
noverb:  Well,
active:  moonshine is a brighter thing
noverb:  fog
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  But I am very much mistaken
active:  this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is it
active:  It was a widespread
noverb:  comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed
noverb:  with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
noverb:  The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys
noverb:  however
noverb:  gave it a stricken look
noverb:  as
noverb:  the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
active:  We called at the door
noverb:  the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots
active:  her master wore at the time of his death
noverb:  also a pair of the son's
noverb:  not the pair
active:  he had
passive: had
active:  Having measured these very carefully from seven
noverb:  eight different points
novoice: Holmes desired
passive: to be led to the court-yard
noverb:  from
noverb:  we all followed the winding track
active:  led to Boscombe Pool
passive: Sherlock Holmes was transformed
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon such a scent as this
noverb:  Men
active:  had only known the quiet thinker
active:  logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him
noverb:  His face flushed
noverb:  darkened
passive: His brows were drawn into two hard black lines
active:  his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
active:  His face was bent downward
noverb:  his shoulders bowed
noverb:  his lips compressed
novoice: the veins stood out
noverb:  whipcord in his long
noverb:  sinewy neck
active:  His nostrils seemed
active:  to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase
active:  his mind was
novoice: absolutely concentrated upon the matter
noverb:  him
noverb:  a question
noverb:  remark fell unheeded upon his ears
noverb:  at the
active:  only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply
noverb:  Swiftly
active:  silently he made his way along the track
active:  ran through the meadows
noverb:  by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool
active:  It was damp
noverb:  , marshy ground
active:  is all
noverb:  district
active:  there were marks of many feet
noverb:  upon the path
noverb:  amid the short grass
active:  bounded it on
noverb:  side
active:  Sometimes Holmes would hurry on
noverb:  sometimes stop dead
active:  once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  I walked behind him
noverb:  the detective indifferent
noverb:  contemptuous
active:  I watched my friend with the interest
active:  sprang from the conviction
passive: every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
noverb:  The Boscombe Pool
noverb:  is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across
active:  is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner
noverb:  Above the woods
active:  lined it upon the farther side
active:  we could see the red
noverb:  jutting pinnacles
active:  marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling
active:  On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick
noverb:  there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
active:  lined the lake
noverb:  Lestrade showed us the exact spot at
passive: the body had been found
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  so moist was the ground
active:  I could plainly see the traces
passive: had been left by the fall of the stricken man
noverb:  To Holmes
noverb:  as I could see by his eager face
active:  peering eyes
active:  very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass
active:  He ran round
noverb:  like a dog
active:  is picking up a scent
noverb:  turned upon my companion
active:  did you go into the pool for
active:  he asked
active:  I fished about with a rake
active:  I thought
active:  there might be some weapon or other trace
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut
active:  I have no time
active:  That left foot of
novoice: yours with its inward twist is all
noverb:  over the place
active:  A mole could trace it
noverb:  there
active:  it vanishes among the reeds
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  simple it would all have been had
active:  I been here
noverb:  before they came
noverb:  a herd of buffalo
novoice: wallowed all over it
active:  Here is
active:  the party with the lodge-keeper came
active:  they have covered all tracks for six
active:  eight feet round the body
active:  here are three separate tracks of the same feet
active:  He drew out a lens
active:  lay down upon his waterproof
active:  to have a better view
active:  talking all the time rather to himself
noverb:  to us
noverb:  These are young McCarthy's feet
active:  Twice he was walking
active:  once he ran swiftly
passive: the soles are deeply marked
noverb:  the heels hardly visible
active:  That bears out his story
active:  He ran
active:  he saw his father on the ground
active:  here are the father's feet
active:  he paced up and down
active:  is this
active:  It is the butt-end of the gun
active:  the son stood listening
noverb:  And this
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  have we here
noverb:  Tiptoes! tiptoes
noverb:  Square,
noverb:  too
noverb:  quite unusual boots
active:  They come
active:  they go
active:  they come again
noverb:  of course
active:  was for the cloak
active:  Now where did they come from
active:  He ran up and down
noverb:  sometimes losing
active:  sometimes finding the track
active:  we were well within the edge of the wood
noverb:  under the shadow of a great beech
noverb:  the largest tree in the neighbourhood
active:  Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this
active:  lay down once
noverb:  upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
active:  For a long time he remained there
noverb:  turning over the leaves
noverb:  dried sticks
active:  gathering up
novoice: seemed to me to be dust into an envelope
active:  examining with his lens not only the ground
noverb:  even the bark of the tree
active:  he could reach
active:  A jagged stone was lying among the moss
noverb:  this also he carefully examined and retained
active:  he followed a pathway through the wood
active:  he came to the highroad
passive: all traces were lost
active:  It has been a case of considerable interest
active:  he remarked
noverb:  returning to his natural manner
active:  I fancy
active:  this grey house on the right must be the lodge
active:  I think
active:  I will go in
active:  have a word with Moran
active:  perhaps write a little note
active:  Having done
active:  we may drive back to our luncheon
active:  You may walk to the cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you presently
active:  It was about ten minutes
active:  we regained our cab
active:  drove back into Ross
active:  Holmes still carrying with him the stone
active:  he had picked up in the wood
active:  This may interest you, Lestrade
active:  he remarked
active:  holding it out
passive: The murder was done with
noverb:  it
active:  I see no marks
active:  There are none
active:  do you know
active:  The grass was growing under
noverb:  it
active:  It had only lain there a few days
active:  There was no sign of a place whence
passive: it had been taken
active:  It corresponds with the injuries
active:  There is no sign of any other weapon
noverb:  And the murderer
noverb:  Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg
active:  wears thick-soled shooting-boots
noverb:  a grey cloak
noverb:  smokes Indian cigars
noverb:  uses a cigar-holder
noverb:  carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket
active:  There are several other indications
noverb:  these may be enough
active:  to aid us in our search
active:  Lestrade laughed
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am still a sceptic
active:  he said
active:  Theories are all very well
active:  we have
active:  to deal with a hard-headed British jury
noverb:  Nous verrons
active:  answered Holmes calmly
active:  You work your own method
active:  I shall work mine
active:  I shall be busy
noverb:  this afternoon
active:  shall probably return to London by the evening train
noverb:  And leave your case unfinished
noverb:  No
noverb:  finished
noverb:  the mystery
passive: It is solved
active:  was the criminal
noverb:  The gentleman
active:  I describe
active:  is he
active:  Surely it would not be difficult
active:  to find out
active:  This is not such a populous neighbourhood
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am a practical man
active:  he said
active:  and I really cannot undertake
active:  to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg
active:  I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard
noverb:  All right
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  I have given you the chance
active:  Here are your lodgings
noverb:  Good-bye
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
active:  I leave
active:  Having left Lestrade at his rooms
active:  we drove to our hotel
active:  we found lunch upon the table
active:  Holmes was silent
active:  buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face
noverb:  as one
active:  finds himself in a perplexing position
noverb:  Look here
noverb:  Watson
active:  he said
passive: the cloth was cleared
active:  just sit down in this chair
noverb:  let me preach to
noverb:  you for a little
noverb:  I don't know quite
active:  to do
active:  I should value your advice
active:  Light a cigar
noverb:  let me expound
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  now
active:  considering this case
active:  there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative
active:  struck us
active:  they impressed me in his favour and you against him
active:  One was the fact
active:  his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee
active:  seeing him
active:  The other was his singular dying reference to a rat
active:  He mumbled several words
active:  you understand
active:  was all
active:  caught the son's ear
noverb:  Now from this double point
active:  our research must commence
active:  we will begin it
active:  presuming
active:  the lad says
active:  is absolutely true
noverb:  of this 'Cooee
noverb:  Well,
passive: obviously it could not have been meant for the son
noverb:  The son
active:  he knew
active:  was in Bristol
active:  It was mere chance
active:  he was within earshot
noverb:  The 'Cooee
passive: was meant
active:  to attract the attention of whoever it was
active:  he had the appointment with
noverb:  But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry
noverb:  one
passive: is used between Australians
active:  There is a strong presumption
noverb:  that the person
novoice: McCarthy expected
active:  to meet
active:  him at Boscombe Pool was someone
noverb:  who had been in Australia
noverb:  of the rat
active:  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket
active:  flattened it out on the table
active:  This is a map of the Colony of Victoria
active:  he said
active:  I wired to Bristol for it last night
active:  He put his hand over part of the map
noverb:  do you read
noverb:  ARAT
active:  I read
noverb:  And now
active:  He raised his hand
noverb:  BALLARAT
noverb:  Quite
active:  That was the word
novoice: the man uttered
noverb:  of
noverb:  his son only caught the last two syllables
active:  He was trying to utter the name of his murderer
noverb:  of Ballarat
active:  It is wonderful
active:  I exclaimed
active:  It is obvious
noverb:  And now
noverb:  you see
active:  I had narrowed the field down considerably
active:  The possession of a grey garment was a third point
active:  granting the son's statement
active:  to be correct
active:  was a certainty
active:  We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  And one
active:  was at home in the district
passive: for the pool can only be approached by the farm
noverb:  by the estate
active:  strangers could hardly wander
noverb:  Quite
active:  comes our expedition of to-day
active:  By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details
active:  I gave to that imbecile Lestrade
noverb:  as to the personality of the criminal
active:  did you gain them
active:  You know my method
passive: It is founded upon the observation of trifles
noverb:  His height
active:  I know
active:  you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
noverb:  His boots
noverb:  too
active:  might be told from their traces
noverb:  Yes
active:  they were peculiar boots
noverb:  his lameness
active:  The impression of his right foot was always less distinct
noverb:  his left
active:  He put
noverb:  weight upon it
active:  he limped
active:  he was lame
noverb:  his left-handedness
noverb:  You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury
passive: recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
passive: The blow was struck from immediately behind
active:  was upon the left side
noverb:  Now,
active:  can
active:  be
active:  it were by a left-handed man
active:  He had stood behind
noverb:  tree during the interview between the father and son
active:  He had even smoked there
active:  I found the ash of a cigar
active:  my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me
active:  to pronounce as an Indian cigar
active:  I have
active:  you know
active:  devoted some attention to this
active:  written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco
active:  Having found the ash
noverb:  I
active:  looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
active:  he had tossed it
active:  It was an Indian cigar
noverb:  of the variety
passive: are rolled in Rotterdam
noverb:  And the cigar-holder?
active:  I could see
active:  the end had not been in his mouth
active:  Therefore he used a holder
passive: The tip had been cut off
active:  not bitten off
noverb:  the cut was not a clean one
active:  I deduced a blunt pen-knife
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I said
noverb:  you have drawn a net round this man from
active:  he cannot escape
active:  you have saved an innocent human life
active:  you had cut the cord
active:  was hanging him
active:  I see the direction in
noverb:  all this points
active:  The culprit is
noverb:  Mr. John Turner
active:  cried the hotel waiter
active:  opening the door of our sitting-room
active:  ushering in a visitor
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a strange and impressive figure
noverb:  His slow
noverb:  limping step
active:  bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude
noverb:  his hard, deep-lined, craggy features
active:  his enormous limbs showed
passive: he was possessed of unusual strength of body
noverb:  of character
noverb:  His tangled beard
noverb:  grizzled hair
noverb:  outstanding
active:  drooping eyebrows combined
active:  to give an air of dignity
noverb:  power to his appearance
active:  his face was of an ashen white
noverb:  his lips
passive: the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
active:  It was clear
noverb:  to me at a glance
active:  he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
active:  Pray
active:  sit down on the sofa
active:  said Holmes gently
active:  You had my note
noverb:  Yes
active:  the lodge-keeper brought it up
active:  You said
noverb:  you wished to see me here
active:  to avoid scandal
active:  I thought people
active:  would talk
active:  I went to the Hall
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you wish
active:  to see me
active:  He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes
noverb:  as
passive: his question was already answered
noverb:  Yes
active:  said Holmes
active:  answering the look rather
noverb:  the words
active:  It is
active:  I know all about McCarthy
active:  The old man sank his face in his hands
active:  God help me
active:  he cried
active:  But I would not have let the young man
active:  come
active:  to harm
noverb:  I give you my word
active:  I would have spoken out
active:  it went against him at the Assizes
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear
active:  you say
active:  said Holmes gravely
noverb:  I
active:  would have spoken now
active:  had it not been for my dear girl
active:  It would break her heart
active:  it will break her heart
active:  she hears
passive: I am arrested
active:  It may not come to that
active:  said Holmes
active:  I am no official agent
active:  I understand
active:  it was your daughter
noverb:  who required my presence here
active:  I am acting in her interests
active:  Young McCarthy must be
active:  got off
noverb:  however
active:  I am a dying man
active:  said old Turner
active:  I have had diabetes for years
active:  My doctor says
active:  it is a question
noverb:  whether I shall live a month
active:  Yet I would rather die under my own roof
noverb:  in a gaol
active:  Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper
noverb:  him
noverb:  Just tell us the truth
active:  he said
active:  I shall jot down the facts
active:  You will sign it
active:  Watson here can witness it
active:  Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity
active:  to save young McCarthy
active:  I promise you
active:  I shall not use it
passive: it is absolutely needed
active:  It's as well
active:  said the old man
active:  it's a question
active:  I shall live to the Assizes
active:  it matters little to me
active:  I should wish
noverb:  to spare Alice the shock
active:  And now I will make the thing clear
noverb:  to you
active:  it has been a long time in the acting
noverb:  will not take me long
active:  to tell
noverb:  You didn't know this dead man
noverb:  McCarthy

active:  he stammered
active:  My heart had turned
active:  to lead
active:  It is K. K. K.
noverb:  ,' said I.
active:  He looked inside the envelope
active:  it is
active:  he cried
active:  Here are the very letters
active:  is this written above them
active:  Put the papers on the sundial
active:  I read
active:  peeping over his shoulder
noverb:  papers
noverb:  sundial
active:  he asked
noverb:  The sundial in the garden
active:  There is no other
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  I
active:  the papers must be those
passive: are destroyed
noverb:  Pooh
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  gripping hard at his courage
active:  We are in a civilised land here
noverb:  we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
active:  Where does the thing come from
noverb:  From Dundee
active:  I answered
active:  glancing at the postmark
noverb:  Some preposterous practical joke
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  have I
active:  to do with sundials and papers
active:  I shall take no notice of such nonsense
active:  I should certainly speak to the police
active:  I said
passive: And be laughed at for my pains
noverb:  Nothing of the sort
noverb:  let me do
noverb:  No
active:  I forbid you
noverb:  I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense
active:  It was in vain
active:  to argue with him
noverb:  for
active:  he was a very obstinate man
active:  I went about
noverb:  however
noverb:  with a heart
active:  was full of forebodings
active:  On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his
noverb:  Major Freebody
active:  is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill
active:  I was glad
noverb:  that he should go
novoice: for it seemed to me
active:  he was farther
noverb:  from danger
active:  he was away from home
noverb:  In
noverb:  however
active:  I was in error
active:  Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major
active:  imploring me
active:  to come at once
active:  My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits
active:  abound in the neighbourhood
active:  was lying senseless
noverb:  with a shattered skull
active:  I hurried to him
active:  he passed away
novoice: having
active:  recovered his consciousness
active:  He had
active:  it appears
active:  been returning from Fareham in the twilight
active:  the country was unknown to him
noverb:  the chalk-pit unfenced
active:  the jury had no hesitation
active:  bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes
noverb:  Carefully
active:  I examined every fact
novoice: connected with his death
active:  I was unable
active:  to find anything
active:  could suggest the idea of murder
active:  There were no signs of violence
noverb:  , no footmarks
noverb:  no robbery
passive: no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
noverb:  And
active:  I need
active:  not tell you
active:  my mind was far from at ease
active:  I was well-nigh
noverb:  certain
passive: some foul plot had been woven
active:  round him
active:  In this sinister way I came into my inheritance
active:  You will ask me
active:  I did not dispose of
noverb:  it
active:  I answer
active:  I was well convinced
active:  our troubles
active:  were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life
active:  the danger would be
active:  pressing in one house as in another
active:  It was in January, '85
novoice: my poor father met his end
noverb:  two years
active:  eight months have elapsed
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  I have lived happily at Horsham
active:  I had begun to hope
active:  this curse had passed away from the family
active:  it had ended with the last generation
active:  I had begun
active:  to take comfort too soon
noverb:  however
noverb:  yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
active:  it had come upon my father
active:  The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope
noverb:  turning to the table
active:  he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
active:  This is the envelope
active:  he continued
active:  The postmark is London
noverb:  eastern division
active:  are the very words
active:  were upon my father's last message
noverb:  'K. K. K.';
noverb:  then 'Put the papers on the sundial
active:  have you done
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Nothing
active:  To tell the truth
active:  he sank his face into his thin
noverb:  white hands
active:  I have felt helpless
active:  I have
active:  felt like one of those poor rabbits
active:  the snake is writhing towards
noverb:  it
active:  I seem
active:  to be in the grasp of some resistless
noverb:  inexorable evil
noverb:  no foresight
active:  no precautions can guard against
noverb:  Tut! tut
active:  cried Sherlock Holmes
active:  You must act
noverb:  man
passive: you are lost
noverb:  Nothing
active:  energy can save you
active:  This is no time for despair
active:  I have seen the police
noverb:  Ah
active:  they listened to my story with a smile
active:  I am convinced
active:  the inspector has formed the opinion
active:  the letters are all practical jokes
active:  the deaths of my relations were really accidents
novoice: as the jury stated
active:  were not
passive: to be connected with the warnings
active:  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
noverb:  Incredible imbecility
active:  he cried
active:  They have
noverb:  however
noverb:  allowed me a policeman
active:  may remain in the house with me
passive: Has
active:  he come with
noverb:  you to-night?
noverb:  No
active:  His orders were
active:  to stay in the house
active:  Again Holmes raved in the air
active:  did you come to me
active:  he cried
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  did you not come at once
active:  I did not know
active:  It was only to-day
noverb:  that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles
passive: was advised by him
active:  to come to
noverb:  you
active:  It is really two days
active:  you had the letter
active:  We should have acted
noverb:  this
active:  You have no further evidence
active:  I suppose
active:  you have placed
noverb:  us
noverb:  no suggestive detail
active:  might help us
active:  There is one thing
active:  said John Openshaw
active:  He rummaged in his coat pocket
active:  drawing out a piece
novoice: discoloured
noverb:  blue-tinted paper
active:  he laid it out upon the table
active:  I have some remembrance
active:  said he
noverb:  on the day
active:  my uncle burned the papers
active:  I observed
noverb:  the small, unburned margins
active:  lay
active:  amid the ashes were of this particular colour
active:  I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room
passive: I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  it may be one of the papers
active:  has
noverb:  perhaps
novoice: fluttered out from among the others
active:  in that way has escaped destruction
noverb:  Beyond the mention of pips
active:  I do not see
noverb:  it helps us much
active:  I think myself
active:  it is a page
noverb:  from some private diary
active:  The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's
active:  Holmes moved the lamp
noverb:  we
noverb:  bent over the sheet of paper
active:  showed by its ragged edge
passive: it had indeed been torn from a book
passive: It was headed
noverb:  March
noverb:  1869
noverb:  and
active:  were the following enigmatical notices
noverb:  4th
active:  Hudson came
noverb:  Same old platform
noverb:  7th
active:  Set the pips on McCauley
noverb:  Paramore
noverb:  John Swain
noverb:  of St. Augustine
noverb:  9th
active:  McCauley cleared
noverb:  10th
active:  John Swain cleared
noverb:  12th
noverb:  Visited Paramore
noverb:  All well
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  folding up the paper
active:  returning it to our visitor
active:  And now you must on no account lose another instant
active:  We cannot spare time even to discuss
active:  you have told me
active:  You must get home
noverb:  act
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  There is
noverb:  one thing
active:  to do
passive: It must be done at once
active:  You must put this piece of paper
active:  you have shown us into the brass box
active:  you have described
active:  You must also put in a note
active:  to say
passive: all the other papers were burned by your uncle
noverb:  this is the only one
noverb:  remains
active:  You must assert
noverb:  in such words
active:  will carry conviction with them
active:  Having done this
active:  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial
passive: directed
active:  Do you understand
noverb:  Entirely
active:  Do not think of revenge
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  at present
active:  I think
active:  we may gain
noverb:  by means of the law
active:  we have our web
active:  to weave
passive: theirs is already woven
active:  The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger
active:  threatens you
active:  The second is
active:  to clear up the mystery
active:  to punish the guilty parties
active:  I thank you
active:  said the young man
noverb:  rising
noverb:  pulling on his overcoat
active:  You have given me fresh life and hope
active:  I shall certainly do
active:  you advise
active:  Do not lose an instant
noverb:  And,
noverb:  above all
noverb:  take care of yourself in the meanwhile
noverb:  for I do not think
active:  there can be a doubt
noverb:  that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
active:  do you go back
noverb:  By train from Waterloo
active:  It is not
noverb:  nine
passive: The streets will be crowded
active:  I trust
active:  you may be in safety
noverb:  And
active:  you cannot guard yourself too closely
passive: I am armed
active:  That is well
active:  To-morrow I shall set
active:  to work upon your case
active:  I shall see you at Horsham
noverb:  No
noverb:  your secret lies in London
active:  It is there
noverb:  that I shall seek it
active:  I shall call upon
noverb:  you in a day
noverb:  in two days
noverb:  with news as to the box and the papers
active:  I shall take your advice in every particular
active:  He shook hands with us
active:  took his leave
novoice: Outside the wind still screamed
active:  the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
active:  This strange, wild story seemed
active:  to have come to us from amid the mad elements
noverb:  blown in upon us
noverb:  a sheet of sea-weed in a gale
noverb:  now
passive: to have
passive: been reabsorbed by them once
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence
noverb:  with his head sunk forward
active:  his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
active:  he lit his pipe
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  he watched the blue smoke-rings
noverb:  as they chased each other up to the ceiling
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  he remarked at last
noverb:  of all our cases
active:  we have had none more fantastic
noverb:  than this
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  the Sign of Four
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  that
noverb:  And
active:  this John Openshaw seems to me
active:  to be walking amid even greater perils
active:  did the Sholtos
active:  have you
active:  I asked
active:  formed any definite conception as to
active:  these perils are
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  as to their nature
active:  he answered
active:  are they
active:  is this K. K. K.
active:  does he pursue this unhappy family
active:  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes
active:  placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  The ideal reasoner
active:  he remarked
active:  would
active:  he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings
active:  deduce from it not only all the chain of events
novoice: led up to it
noverb:  also all the results
active:  would follow from
noverb:  it
active:  As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone
noverb:  the observer
active:  has thoroughly understood
active:  one link in a series of incidents should be able
active:  to accurately state all the other ones
noverb:  after
active:  We have not yet grasped the results
active:  the reason alone can attain to
passive: Problems may be solved in the study
active:  have baffled all those
active:  have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
active:  To carry the art
noverb:  however, to its highest pitch,
active:  it is necessary
noverb:  that the reasoner should be able
active:  to utilise all the facts
active:  have come to his knowledge
active:  and this in itself implies
noverb:  as you will readily see
noverb:  a possession of all knowledge
noverb:  even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias
active:  is a somewhat rare accomplishment
active:  It is not
noverb:  impossible
noverb:  however
active:  a man should possess all knowledge
active:  is likely
active:  to be useful to him in his work
noverb:  this
active:  I have endeavoured in my case
active:  to do
active:  If I remember rightly
active:  you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion
noverb:  Yes
active:  I answered
noverb:  laughing
active:  It was a singular document
noverb:  Philosophy
noverb:  astronomy
passive: politics were marked at zero
active:  I remember
noverb:  Botany variable
noverb:  geology profound as regards
noverb:  the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town
noverb:  chemistry eccentric
noverb:  anatomy unsystematic
noverb:  , sensational literature
noverb:  crime records unique, violin-player, boxer
noverb:  swordsman
noverb:  lawyer
noverb:  self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
noverb:  Those
active:  I think
active:  were the main points of my analysis
active:  Holmes grinned at the last item
noverb:  Well
active:  he said
active:  I say now
noverb:  as I said
active:  a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture
active:  he is likely
active:  to use
noverb:  the rest
active:  he can put away in the lumber-room of his library
active:  he can get it
active:  he wants it
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  for such a case as the one
passive: has been submitted to us to-night
active:  we need certainly to muster all our resources
noverb:  Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia
noverb:  stands upon the shelf beside you
active:  Thank you
noverb:  Now let us consider the situation
noverb:  see
passive: may be deduced from
noverb:  it
noverb:  In the first place
active:  we may start with a strong presumption
active:  Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America
active:  Men at his time of life do not change all their habits
noverb:  exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town
active:  His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea
active:  he was in fear of someone
noverb:  something
active:  we may assume as a working hypothesis
active:  it was fear of someone or something
noverb:  which drove him from America
noverb:  As to
noverb:  it was he feared
active:  we can only deduce
active:  considering the formidable letters
passive: were received by himself and his successors
active:  Did you remark the postmarks of those letters
active:  The first was from Pondicherry
noverb:  the second from Dundee
noverb:  the third from London
noverb:  From East London
active:  do you deduce from that
active:  They are all seaports
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We have already a clue
active:  There can be no doubt
noverb:  that the probability--the strong probability--is
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  And now let us consider another point
noverb:  In the case of Pondicherry
active:  seven weeks elapsed between the threat
noverb:  its fulfilment
noverb:  in Dundee
active:  it was only some three
noverb:  four days
active:  Does
active:  suggest anything
noverb:  A greater distance
active:  to travel
active:  the letter had also a greater distance
active:  to come
active:  I do not see the point
active:  There is at least a presumption
noverb:  that the vessel in
noverb:  the man
active:  men are
active:  is a sailing-ship
active:  It looks as
active:  they always send their singular warning
noverb:  token
noverb:  them
noverb:  starting upon their mission
active:  You see
active:  quickly the deed followed the sign
active:  it came from Dundee
active:  they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer
active:  they would have arrived almost
noverb:  their letter
active:  , as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed
active:  I think
active:  those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat
active:  brought the letter
noverb:  the sailing vessel
active:  brought the writer
active:  It is possible
noverb:  More than that
active:  It is probable
active:  And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case
active:  I urged young Openshaw
active:  to caution
active:  The blow has always fallen at the end of the time
active:  it would take the senders
active:  to travel the distance
active:  this one comes from London
active:  therefore we cannot count upon delay
noverb:  Good God
active:  I cried
active:  can it mean
noverb:  this relentless persecution
noverb:  The papers
active:  Openshaw carried
active:  are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship
active:  I think
active:  it is quite clear
noverb:  that there must be more than one of them
active:  A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as
active:  to deceive a coroner's jury
active:  There must have been several in it
active:  they must have been men of resource and determination
noverb:  Their papers they mean to have
active:  be the holder of them
active:  it may
active:  In this way you see K. K. K.
active:  ceases to be the initials of an individual
active:  becomes the badge of a society
noverb:  of
noverb:  society
active:  Have you never
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  bending forward
active:  sinking his voice
active:  have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan
active:  I never have
active:  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
noverb:  Here it is
active:  said he presently
noverb:  Ku Klux Klan
passive: A name derived
novoice: from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced
active:  cocking a rifle
active:  This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War
noverb:  it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country
noverb:  notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida
passive: Its power was used for political purposes
noverb:  principally for the terrorising of the negro voters
noverb:  the murdering and driving from the country of those
passive: were opposed to its views
passive: Its outrages were usually preceded
novoice: by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
noverb:  generally recognised shape
noverb:  a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts
noverb:  melon seeds
noverb:  orange pips in others
active:  receiving this the victim
active:  might
active:  openly abjure his former ways
active:  might fly from the country
active:  he braved the matter out
active:  death would unfailingly come upon him
noverb:  usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
active:  perfect was the organisation of the society
noverb:  so systematic its methods
active:  there is hardly a case
noverb:  upon record
novoice: any man succeeded in braving it with impunity
noverb:  in
passive: any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
active:  For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government
noverb:  of the better classes of the community in the South
noverb:  Eventually,
noverb:  in the year 1869
noverb:  the movement rather suddenly collapsed
active:  there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort
noverb:  date
active:  You will observe
active:  said Holmes
active:  laying down the volume
noverb:  the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers
active:  It may well
active:  have been cause and effect
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that he
active:  his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
active:  You can understand
noverb:  this register
active:  diary may implicate some of the first men in the South
active:  there may be many
noverb:  who will not sleep easy at night
passive: it is recovered
noverb:  the page
active:  we have seen
active:  Is such as
active:  we might expect
active:  It ran
active:  I remember right
active:  sent the pips to A
noverb:  B
noverb:  C
active:  that is
active:  sent the society's warning to them
active:  there are successive entries
noverb:  A
novoice: B cleared
active:  left the country
noverb:  finally
passive: C was visited
noverb:  with
active:  I fear
noverb:  a sinister result for C. Well
active:  I think
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we may let some light into this dark place
active:  I believe
active:  the only chance young Openshaw has
active:  in the meantime is to do
active:  I have told him
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more
passive: to be said
active:  to be done to-night
active:  hand me over my violin
noverb:  let us try
active:  to forget for half an hour the miserable weather
noverb:  the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
active:  It had cleared in the morning
active:  the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil
noverb:  hangs over the great city
active:  Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast
active:  I came down
active:  You will excuse me for not waiting for
noverb:  you
active:  said he
active:  I have
active:  I foresee
noverb:  a very busy day
noverb:  me
active:  looking into this case of young Openshaw's
noverb:  steps will you take
active:  I asked
active:  It will very much
active:  depend upon the results of my first inquiries
active:  I may have
active:  to go down to Horsham
noverb:  after all
noverb:  You will not go there first
noverb:  No
active:  I shall commence with the City
active:  Just ring the bell
active:  the maid will bring up your coffee
active:  I waited
active:  I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table
active:  glanced my eye over it
active:  It rested upon a heading
active:  sent a chill to my heart
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  you are too late
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  laying down his cup
active:  I feared as much
passive: was it done
active:  He spoke calmly
active:  I could see
passive: he was deeply moved
active:  My eye caught the name of Openshaw
noverb:  the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge
active:  Here is the account
noverb:  Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge
active:  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
noverb:  The night
noverb:  however
active:  was extremely dark and stormy
noverb:  in spite of the help of several passers-by
active:  it was quite impossible
active:  to effect a rescue
noverb:  The alarm
noverb:  however
active:  was given
noverb:  by the aid of the water-police
passive: the body was eventually recovered
active:  It proved to be
noverb:  of a young gentleman
noverb:  name
active:  it appears from an envelope
passive: was found in his pocket
active:  was John Openshaw
active:  residence is near Horsham
passive: It is conjectured
active:  he may have been hurrying down
active:  to catch the last train from Waterloo Station
noverb:  in his haste
noverb:  the extreme darkness
active:  he missed his path
active:  walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats
active:  The body exhibited no traces of violence
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
active:  should have the effect
active:  calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages
active:  We sat in silence for some minutes
noverb:  Holmes more depressed and shaken
noverb:  than I had ever seen him
active:  That hurts my pride, Watson
active:  he said at last
active:  It is a petty feeling
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it hurts my pride
active:  It becomes a personal matter with me now
noverb:  God sends me health
active:  I shall set my hand upon this gang
active:  he should come to me for help
active:  I should send him away to his death
noverb:  !
active:  He sprang from his chair
active:  paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
active:  They must be cunning devils
active:  he exclaimed at last
active:  could
active:  they have decoyed him down there
active:  The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station
noverb:  The bridge, no doubt
active:  was too crowded
noverb:  even on such a night
noverb:  for their purpose
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall see
active:  will win in the long run
active:  I am going out now
noverb:  To the police
noverb:  No
active:  I shall be my own police
active:  When I have spun the web
active:  they may take the flies
noverb:  not before
noverb:  All day
passive: I was engaged in my professional work
active:  it was late
noverb:  in the evening
active:  I returned to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes had not come back
active:  It was nearly ten
noverb:  o'clock
active:  he entered
noverb:  looking pale
noverb:  worn
active:  He walked up to the sideboard
active:  tearing a piece from the loaf
active:  he devoured it voraciously
active:  washing it down with a long draught of water
active:  You are hungry
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Starving
active:  It had escaped my memory
active:  I have had nothing
noverb:  breakfast
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Not a bite
active:  I had no time
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  And
active:  have you succeeded
noverb:  Well

noverb:  doubtless among the dregs of the docks
noverb:  breathing in the poison

noverb:  There
active:  he was to be found

noverb:  of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane

active:  she had given me
noverb:  And
noverb:  in ten minutes

novoice: it seemed to me at the time
active:  the future only could show
noverb:  strange it was
active:  to be
active:  there was no great difficulty
noverb:  in the first stage of my adventure
noverb:  Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves

noverb:  Ordering my cab
active:  to wait
active:  I passed down the steps
noverb:  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet
active:  and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch

noverb:  thick
noverb:  heavy with the brown opium smoke
novoice: terraced with wooden berths
noverb:  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
active:  Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies
active:  lying in strange fantastic poses
noverb:  bowed shoulders
noverb:  bent knees
noverb:  heads thrown back
active:  chins pointing upward
noverb:  with here
noverb:  there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer
noverb:  Out of the black shadows

noverb:  now bright
noverb:  now faint
noverb:  as the burning poison waxed
novoice: waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
noverb:  The most lay silent
noverb:  some muttered to themselves
novoice: others talked together in a strange
noverb:  low
noverb:  monotonous voice
noverb:  their conversation coming in gushes
active:  suddenly tailing off into silence
noverb:  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
active:  At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal
noverb:  beside
active:  on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall
noverb:  thin old man
active:  with his jaw resting upon his two fists
noverb:  his elbows upon his knees
noverb:  staring into the fire
active:  I entered
active:  a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me
noverb:  a supply of the drug
active:  beckoning me to an empty berth
active:  Thank you
active:  I have not come
active:  to stay
active:  said I.
active:  There is a friend
noverb:  of mine here
noverb:  Mr. Isa Whitney
active:  I wish
active:  to speak with him
active:  There was a movement
noverb:  an exclamation from my right
active:  peering through the gloom
active:  I saw Whitney
noverb:  pale, haggard, and unkempt
active:  staring out at me
noverb:  My God
active:  It's Watson
active:  said he
active:  He was in a pitiable state of reaction
noverb:  with every nerve in a twitter
active:  I say
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  o'clock is it
noverb:  Nearly eleven
noverb:  Of
noverb:  day
noverb:  Of Friday
noverb:  June 19th
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I thought
active:  it was Wednesday
active:  It is Wednesday
noverb:  d'you want
active:  to frighten a chap for
active:  He sank his face onto his arms
active:  began
active:  to sob in a high treble key
active:  I tell you
active:  it is Friday
noverb:  man
active:  Your wife has been waiting this two days for you
active:  You should be ashamed
noverb:  of yourself
active:  I am
noverb:  you've got mixed
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  for I have only been here a few hours
noverb:  three pipes
noverb:  four pipes
active:  I forget
noverb:  many
active:  But I'll go home with you
noverb:  I wouldn't frighten Kate
noverb:  poor little Kate
noverb:  Give me your hand
noverb:  Have you a cab
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have one waiting
active:  I shall go in
noverb:  it
active:  But I must owe something
noverb:  Find
active:  I owe
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am all
noverb:  off colour
active:  I can do nothing for myself
active:  I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers
active:  holding my breath
active:  to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug
noverb:  looking about for the manager
active:  As I passed the tall man
active:  sat by the brazier
active:  I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt
noverb:  a low voice whispered
noverb:  Walk past me
noverb:  look back at me
noverb:  The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
active:  I glanced down
active:  They could only have come from the old man at my side
active:  he sat now
noverb:  very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age
noverb:  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees
noverb:  as
active:  it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
active:  I took two steps forward
active:  looked back
active:  It took all my self-control
active:  to prevent me
active:  breaking out into a cry of astonishment
active:  He had turned his back
active:  that none could see him
active:  I. His form had filled out
passive: his wrinkles were gone
active:  the dull eyes had regained their fire
noverb:  there
noverb:  sitting by the fire
noverb:  grinning at my surprise
noverb:  was none other than Sherlock Holmes
active:  He made a slight motion to me
active:  to approach him
noverb:  as he turned his face half round to the company once
novoice: subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I whispered
noverb:  on earth are you doing in this den
active:  you can
active:  he answered
active:  I have excellent ears
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to get rid of that sottish friend of yours
active:  I should be exceedingly glad
active:  to have a little talk with you
active:  I have a cab
active:  pray
noverb:  send him home in it
active:  You may safely trust him
noverb:  for he appears to be too limp
active:  to get into any mischief
active:  I should recommend you also
active:  to send a note by the cabman to your wife
active:  to say
active:  you have thrown in your lot with me
active:  you will wait
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in five minutes
active:  It was difficult
active:  to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests
noverb:  for they were always
noverb:  exceedingly definite
noverb:  put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
active:  I felt
noverb:  however
active:  Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission
passive: was practically accomplished
noverb:  and for the rest
active:  I could not wish anything better
noverb:  than
passive: to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures
active:  were the normal condition of his existence
active:  In a few minutes I had written my note
active:  paid Whitney's bill
active:  led him out to the cab
noverb:  seen him driven through the darkness
active:  In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
active:  I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes
active:  For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
active:  glancing quickly round
active:  he straightened himself out
noverb:  burst into a hearty fit of laughter
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  you imagine
active:  I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections
noverb:  all the other little weaknesses on
active:  you have favoured me with your medical views
passive: I was certainly surprised
noverb:  to find you there
noverb:  not
noverb:  I
active:  to find you
active:  I came to find a friend
noverb:  And I
active:  to find an enemy
noverb:  An enemy
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  one of my natural enemies
active:  shall I say
noverb:  my natural prey
noverb:  Briefly,
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry
active:  I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
active:  I have done
noverb:  now
passive: Had I been recognised in that den my life
noverb:  would not have been worth an hour's purchase
noverb:  for I have used it
noverb:  now for my own purposes
noverb:  the rascally Lascar
active:  runs
active:  it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
active:  There is a trap-door at the back of
noverb:  building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf,
active:  could tell some strange tales of
active:  has passed through
noverb:  it upon the moonless nights
active:  You do not mean bodies
noverb:  Ay,
noverb:  bodies
noverb:  Watson
active:  We should be rich men
active:  we had $1000 for every poor devil
passive: has been done to death in that den
active:  It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside
active:  I fear
active:  Neville St. Clair has entered it never
active:  to leave it
active:  our trap should be here
active:  He put his two forefingers between his teeth
novoice: whistled shrilly
noverb:  a signal
passive: was answered by a similar whistle from the distance
novoice: followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom
active:  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
active:  You'll come with me
noverb:  won't you
active:  I can be of use
noverb:  Oh
active:  a trusty comrade is always of use
noverb:  and a chronicler still
active:  My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one
noverb:  The Cedars
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is Mr. St. Clair's house
active:  I am staying there
active:  I conduct the inquiry
active:  Where is it
noverb:  Near Lee
noverb:  in Kent
active:  We have a seven-mile drive
noverb:  us
active:  I am all
noverb:  in the dark
active:  course
active:  you are
active:  You'll know all about it presently
noverb:  Jump up here
noverb:  All right
noverb:  John
active:  we shall not need you
noverb:  Here's half a crown
noverb:  Look out for me to-morrow
noverb:  about eleven
active:  Give her her head
noverb:  long
active:  He flicked the horse with his whip
active:  we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre
noverb:  deserted streets
active:  widened gradually
active:  we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge
noverb:  with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
noverb:  Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks
noverb:  mortar
noverb:  its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman
noverb:  the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers
active:  A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky
noverb:  a star
novoice: two twinkled dimly here
noverb:  there through the rifts of the clouds
active:  Holmes drove in silence
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  the air of a man
passive: is lost in thought
active:  I sat beside him
noverb:  curious
active:  to learn
active:  this new quest might be
active:  seemed to tax his powers
noverb:  sorely
noverb:  afraid
active:  to break in upon the current of his thoughts
active:  We had driven several miles
active:  were beginning
active:  to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas
active:  he shook himself
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  lit up his pipe with the air of a man
active:  has satisfied himself
active:  he is acting for the best
active:  You have a grand gift of silence
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
noverb:  Pon my word
active:  it is a great thing
noverb:  for me
active:  to have someone
active:  to talk to
active:  for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant
active:  I was wondering
active:  I should say to this dear little woman to-night
active:  she meets me at the door
active:  You forget
active:  I know nothing about it
noverb:  I shall just have time
noverb:  to tell you the facts of the case
active:  we get to Lee
active:  It seems absurdly simple
active:  somehow I can get nothing
active:  to go upon
active:  There's plenty of thread
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  I can't get the end of it into my hand
noverb:  Now,
active:  I'll state the case clearly
active:  concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark
noverb:  all is dark to me
active:  Proceed

noverb:  such as he had started to town in

active:  made the inspector
active:  realise
active:  the matter was serious
passive: The rooms were carefully examined
noverb:  results all pointed to an abominable crime
passive: The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom
active:  looked out upon the back of one of the wharves
active:  Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip
active:  is dry at low tide
passive: is covered at high tide with at least four
noverb:  a half feet of water
noverb:  The bedroom window was a broad one
novoice: opened from below
active:  On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
active:  several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom
noverb:  Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  with the exception of his coat
noverb:  His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch
noverb:  all were there
active:  There were no signs
noverb:  of violence upon any of these garments
active:  there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  Out of the window he must apparently have gone
passive: for no other exit could be discovered
active:  the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise
active:  he could save himself by swimming
active:  for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
noverb:  And now as to the villains
active:  seemed
passive: to be immediately implicated in the matter
passive: The Lascar was known
active:  to be a man of the vilest antecedents
noverb:  as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known
novoice: to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window
active:  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
active:  His defence was one of absolute ignorance
active:  he protested
active:  he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone
noverb:  his lodger
active:  he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes
noverb:  much for the Lascar manager
noverb:  Now for the sinister cripple
noverb:  lives upon the second floor of the opium den
active:  was certainly the last human being
active:  eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair
active:  His name is Hugh Boone
active:  his hideous face is one
active:  is familiar to every man
active:  goes much to the City
active:  He is a professional beggar
noverb:  in order
active:  to avoid the police regulations
active:  he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas
noverb:  Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is
noverb:  as you may have remarked
noverb:  a small angle in the wall
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  this creature takes his daily seat
noverb:  cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap
active:  he is a piteous spectacle
active:  a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap
noverb:  lies upon the pavement beside him
active:  I have watched the fellow more than once
noverb:  I thought
active:  making his professional acquaintance
passive: I have been surprised at the harvest
active:  he has reaped in a short time
noverb:  His appearance
noverb:  you see
active:  is so remarkable
active:  no one can pass him
active:  observing him
noverb:  A shock of orange hair
passive: a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar
active:  , by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip
noverb:  a bulldog chin
noverb:  a pair of very penetrating dark eyes
active:  present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair
noverb:  all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants
noverb:  too
active:  does his wit
noverb:  for he is
noverb:  ready with a reply to any piece of chaff
passive: may be thrown at him by the passers-by
active:  This is the man
active:  we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den
active:  to have been the last man
active:  to see the gentleman of
active:  we are in quest
noverb:  a cripple
active:  said I.
active:  could
active:  he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life
active:  He is a cripple
noverb:  in the sense
active:  he walks with a limp
noverb:  in other respects
active:  he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man
active:  Surely your medical experience would tell you
noverb:  Watson
passive: weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
active:  Pray
active:  continue your narrative
active:  Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window
passive: she was escorted home in a cab by the police
active:  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
noverb:  Inspector Barton
active:  had charge of the case
active:  made a very careful examination of the premises
noverb:  without finding anything
active:  threw any light upon the matter
passive: One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone
passive: he was allowed some few minutes during
active:  he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar
passive: this fault was soon remedied
passive: he was seized and searched
passive: without anything being found
active:  could incriminate him
active:  There were
active:  it is true
noverb:  , some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve
noverb:  ,
active:  he pointed to his ring-finger
passive: had been cut near the nail
active:  explained
active:  the bleeding came from there
active:  adding
active:  he had been to the window not long before
noverb:  the stains
active:  had been observed there
active:  came doubtless from the same source
noverb:  He
active:  denied strenuously
novoice: having
noverb:  seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  swore
active:  the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police
noverb:  As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion
active:  she had actually seen her husband at the window
active:  he declared
active:  she must have been
noverb:  mad
noverb:  dreaming
passive: He was removed
passive: loudly protesting
noverb:  to the police-station
active:  the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope
active:  the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
active:  And it did
passive: they hardly found upon the mud-bank
active:  they had feared
active:  to find
active:  It was Neville St. Clair's coat
noverb:  not Neville St. Clair
active:  lay uncovered
active:  the tide receded
noverb:  And
active:  do you think
passive: they found in the pockets
active:  I cannot imagine
noverb:  No
noverb:  I don't think
active:  you would guess
active:  Every pocket stuffed with pennies
noverb:  half-pennies
noverb:  421 pennies and 270 half-pennies
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that it had not been swept away by the tide
active:  a human body is a different matter
active:  There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
active:  It seemed likely enough
active:  the weighted coat had remained
passive: the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
active:  I understand
passive: all the other clothes were found in the room
active:  Would the body
passive: be dressed in a coat alone
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
passive: the facts might be met speciously enough
active:  Suppose
active:  this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window
active:  there is no human eye
active:  could have seen the deed
active:  would
active:  he do
active:  It would of course
active:  strike him
active:  he must get rid of the tell-tale garments
active:  He would seize the coat
active:  be in the act
active:  throwing it out
active:  it would occur to him
active:  it would swim
noverb:  not sink
active:  He has little time
noverb:  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
novoice: the wife tried
active:  to force her way up
active:  perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate
active:  the police are hurrying up the street
active:  There is not an instant
passive: to be lost
active:  He rushes to some secret hoard
active:  he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary
active:  he stuffs all the coins upon
active:  he can lay his hands into the pockets
active:  to make sure of the coat's sinking
active:  He throws it out
active:  would have done the same with the other garments
active:  had not he heard the rush of steps below
noverb:  only just had time
active:  to close the window
active:  the police appeared
active:  It certainly sounds feasible
noverb:  Well,
active:  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better
noverb:  Boone
active:  I have told you
passive: was arrested and taken to the station
passive: it could not be shown
active:  there had
active:  been anything against him
active:  He had
passive: for years been known as a professional beggar
novoice: his life appeared
active:  to have been a very quiet
noverb:  innocent one
noverb:  There the matter stands at present
noverb:  the questions
active:  have to be solved
active:  --what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as
active:  I confess
active:  I cannot recall any case within my experience
active:  looked at the first glance
noverb:  simple
noverb:  yet
active:  presented such difficulties
active:  Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
active:  we had been whirling
passive: through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind
active:  we rattled along with a country hedge upon
noverb:  side of us
noverb:  Just as he finished
noverb:  however
active:  we drove through two scattered villages
active:  a few lights still glimmered in the windows
active:  We are on the outskirts of Lee
active:  said my companion
active:  We have touched on three English counties in our short drive
noverb:  starting in Middlesex
noverb:  passing over an angle of Surrey
noverb:  ending in Kent
noverb:  See
active:  light among the trees
active:  That is The Cedars
active:  beside that lamp sits a woman
passive: anxious ears have already
active:  I have little doubt
active:  caught the clink of our horse's feet
active:  are you not conducting the case from Baker Street
active:  I asked
active:  there are many inquiries
passive: must be made out here
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal
active:  you may rest assured
active:  she will have nothing
noverb:  a welcome for my friend and colleague
active:  I hate to meet her
noverb:  Watson
active:  I have no news of her husband
noverb:  Here we are
noverb:  Whoa
noverb:  there
noverb:  whoa
active:  We had pulled up in front of a large villa
novoice: stood within its own grounds
active:  A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head
active:  springing down
active:  I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
active:  led to the house
active:  we approached
active:  the door flew open
novoice: a little blonde woman stood in the opening
noverb:  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie
noverb:  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
active:  She stood
novoice: with her figure outlined against the flood of light
noverb:  one hand upon the door
noverb:  one half-raised in her eagerness
noverb:  her body slightly bent
noverb:  , her head
novoice: face protruded
noverb:  with eager eyes
noverb:  parted lips
noverb:  a standing question
noverb:  Well
active:  she cried
noverb:  well
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  there were two of us
noverb:  , she gave a cry of hope
active:  sank into a groan as she
active:  saw
active:  my companion shook his head
active:  shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  No good news
noverb:  None
noverb:  No bad
noverb:  No
noverb:  Thank God for that
active:  come in
active:  You must be weary
noverb:  , for you have had a long day
active:  This is my friend, Dr. Watson
active:  He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases
active:  a lucky chance has made it possible for me
active:  to bring him out
active:  associate him with this investigation
passive: I am delighted
active:  to see you
active:  said she
active:  pressing my hand warmly
active:  You will
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , forgive anything
active:  may be wanting in our arrangements
active:  you consider the blow
active:  has come
noverb:  suddenly upon us
noverb:  My dear madam
active:  said I
active:  I am an old campaigner
active:  I were not
active:  I can very well see
passive: no apology is needed
active:  If I can be of any assistance
noverb:  to you
noverb:  to my friend here
active:  I shall be indeed happy
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said the lady
active:  we entered a well-lit dining-room
noverb:  upon the table of
passive: a cold supper had been laid out
active:  I should very much
noverb:  like to ask you one or two plain questions
noverb:  to
active:  I beg
active:  you will give a plain answer
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  madam
active:  Do not trouble about my feelings
active:  I am not hysterical
noverb:  ,
noverb:  given
active:  to fainting
active:  I simply wish to hear your real
noverb:  real opinion
noverb:  Upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  In your heart of hearts
active:  do you think
active:  Neville is alive
active:  Sherlock Holmes seemed
passive: to be embarrassed by the question
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  now
active:  she repeated
noverb:  standing upon the rug
noverb:  looking keenly down at him
active:  he leaned back in a basket-chair
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  madam
active:  I do not
active:  You think
active:  he is dead
active:  I do
noverb:  Murdered
noverb:  I don't say that
noverb:  Perhaps
noverb:  And on
noverb:  day did he meet his death
noverb:  On Monday
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to explain
active:  it is
active:  I have received a letter from him to-day
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as
passive: he had been galvanised
active:  he roared
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  to-day
active:  She stood smiling
active:  holding up a little slip of paper in the air
active:  May I see it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  He snatched it from her in his eagerness
active:  smoothing it out upon the table
active:  he drew over the lamp
active:  examined it intently
active:  I had left my chair
active:  was gazing at it over his shoulder
noverb:  The envelope was a very coarse one
passive: was stamped with the Gravesend postmark
noverb:  with the date of that very day
noverb:  rather of the day before
active:  for it was considerably after midnight
noverb:  Coarse writing
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Surely this is not your husband's writing
noverb:  madam
noverb:  No
active:  the enclosure is
active:  I perceive also
active:  whoever addressed the envelope
passive: had
active:  to go and inquire as to the address
active:  can you tell that
noverb:  The name
noverb:  you see
active:  is in perfectly black ink
active:  has dried itself
active:  The rest is of the greyish colour
active:  shows
noverb:  blotting-paper has been used
passive: it had been written straight off
novoice: blotted
active:  none would be of a deep black shade
active:  This man has written the name
active:  there has
active:  been a pause
active:  he wrote the address
active:  can only mean
active:  he was not familiar
noverb:  with it
active:  It is, of course, a trifle
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so important as trifles
noverb:  Let us now see the letter
noverb:  Ha! there has been an enclosure here
noverb:  Yes
active:  there was a ring
noverb:  His signet-ring
active:  And you are sure
active:  this is your husband's hand
noverb:  One of his hands
noverb:  One
noverb:  His hand
active:  he wrote hurriedly
active:  It is very unlike his usual writing
noverb:  I know it well
active:  Dearest do not
passive: be frightened
noverb:  All will come well
active:  There is a huge error
noverb:  which it may take some little time
active:  to rectify
noverb:  Wait in patience
noverb:  NEVILLE
passive: Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark
noverb:  Hum
active:  Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb
noverb:  Ha
passive: And the flap has been gummed
active:  I am not very much
noverb:  in error
noverb:  by a person
active:  had been chewing tobacco
active:  And you have no doubt
active:  it is your husband's hand, madam
noverb:  None
active:  Neville wrote those words
active:  And they were posted to-day at Gravesend
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair
active:  the clouds lighten
active:  I should not venture to say
active:  the danger is over
active:  he must be alive
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  this is a clever forgery
active:  to put us on the wrong scent
active:  The ring, after all, proves nothing
passive: It may have been taken from him
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  it is
active:  it is his very own writing
noverb:  Very well
active:  It may
noverb:  however
passive: have been written on Monday
active:  only posted to-day
active:  That is possible
active:  much may have happened between
noverb:  Oh
active:  you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes
active:  I know
noverb:  all is well with him
active:  There is so keen
noverb:  a sympathy between us
active:  I should know
active:  evil came upon him
noverb:  On the very day
noverb:  I saw him last
active:  he cut himself in the bedroom
noverb:  I in the dining-room rushed upstairs
noverb:  with the utmost certainty
active:  something had happened
active:  Do you think
active:  I would respond to such a trifle
active:  be ignorant of his death
active:  I have seen too much not to know
active:  the impression of a woman may be more valuable
noverb:  the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
active:  And in this letter
active:  you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence
active:  to corroborate your view
active:  your husband is alive and able
active:  to write letters
active:  should he remain away from
noverb:  you
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  It is unthinkable
active:  And on Monday he made no remarks
active:  leaving you
noverb:  No
passive: And you were surprised
active:  to see him in Swandam Lane
noverb:  Very much
active:  Was the window open
noverb:  Yes
active:  he might have called to
noverb:  you
active:  He might
noverb:  He only
active:  I understand
active:  gave an inarticulate cry
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  A call for help
active:  you thought
noverb:  Yes
active:  He waved his hands
active:  it might have been a cry of surprise
active:  Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him
active:  to throw up his hands
active:  It is possible
active:  And you thought
passive: he was pulled back
active:  He disappeared
noverb:  suddenly
active:  He might have leaped back
active:  You did not see anyone else in the room
noverb:  No
active:  this horrible man confessed
active:  to having been there
active:  the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  Your husband
active:  you could see
active:  had his ordinary clothes on
noverb:  without his collar or tie
active:  I distinctly saw his bare throat
active:  Had he
noverb:  spoken of Swandam Lane
noverb:  Never
active:  Had he ever showed any signs
active:  having taken opium
noverb:  Never
active:  Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair
noverb:  Those are the principal points about
active:  I wished to be absolutely clear
active:  We shall
active:  now have a little supper
noverb:  retire
noverb:  for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
noverb:  A large
passive: comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
active:  I was quickly between the sheets
noverb:  for
active:  I was weary
noverb:  after my night of adventure
active:  Sherlock Holmes was a man
noverb:  however
active:  he had an unsolved problem upon his mind
active:  would go for days
active:  even for a week, without rest, turning it over
active:  rearranging his facts
active:  looking at it from every point of view
active:  he had
active:  fathomed it
active:  convinced himself
active:  his data were insufficient
active:  It was soon evident
noverb:  to me
active:  he was
active:  now preparing for an all-night sitting
active:  He took off his coat
noverb:  waistcoat
noverb:  put on a large blue dressing-gown
novoice: wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed
noverb:  cushions from the sofa and armchairs
noverb:  With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan
noverb:  upon
active:  he perched himself cross-legged
novoice: with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
noverb:  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there
noverb:  an old briar pipe between his lips
noverb:  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling
active:  the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless
noverb:  with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features
active:  he sat as
active:  I dropped off
active:  to sleep
active:  he sat
active:  a sudden ejaculation caused me
active:  to wake up
active:  I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
active:  The pipe was still between his lips
noverb:  the smoke still curled upward
active:  the room was full of a dense tobacco haze
novoice: nothing remained of the heap of shag
active:  I had seen upon the previous night
noverb:  Awake
noverb:  Watson
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Game for a morning drive
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  dress
active:  No one is stirring yet
active:  I know
noverb:  the stable-boy sleeps
active:  we shall soon have the trap out
active:  He chuckled to himself as he
active:  spoke
novoice: his eyes twinkled
active:  he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
active:  I dressed
active:  I glanced at my watch
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that no one was stirring
active:  It was twenty-five minutes past four
active:  I had hardly finished
active:  Holmes returned with the news
active:  the boy was putting in the horse
active:  I want to test a little theory of mine
active:  said he
noverb:  pulling on his boots
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe
active:  I deserve
passive: to be kicked from here to Charing Cross
active:  But I think
active:  I have the key of the affair now
active:  And where is it
active:  I asked
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  In the bathroom
active:  he answered
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I am not joking
active:  he continued
active:  seeing my look of incredulity
active:  I have just been there
active:  I have taken it out
active:  I have got it in this Gladstone bag
active:  Come on
noverb:  my boy
active:  we shall see
active:  it will not fit the lock
active:  We made our way downstairs
noverb:  possible
noverb:  out into the bright morning sunshine
active:  In the road stood our horse
noverb:  trap
noverb:  with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head
noverb:  We
active:  sprang in
noverb:  away we dashed down the London Road
active:  A few country carts were stirring
noverb:  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis
noverb:  the lines of villas on
active:  side were as silent
noverb:  lifeless as some city in a dream
active:  It has been in some points a singular case
active:  said Holmes
active:  flicking the horse on into a gallop
active:  I confess
active:  I have been
noverb:  a mole
active:  it is better
active:  to learn wisdom late
noverb:  never
active:  to learn it at all
active:  In town the earliest risers were just beginning
active:  to look sleepily from their windows
active:  we drove through the streets of the Surrey side
noverb:  Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road
active:  we crossed over the river
active:  dashing up Wellington Street
novoice: wheeled sharply to the right
active:  found ourselves in Bow Street
passive: Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force
active:  the two constables at the door saluted him
active:  One of them held the horse's head
active:  the other led us in
active:  is on duty
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Inspector Bradstreet
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Bradstreet
active:  are you
noverb:  A tall
active:  stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage
noverb:  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket
active:  I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Step into my room here
active:  It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table
active:  a telephone projecting from the wall
active:  The inspector sat down at his desk
active:  can
active:  I do for you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I called about that beggarman
noverb:  Boone
noverb:  the one
passive: was charged
passive: being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  of Lee
noverb:  Yes
passive: He was brought up
novoice: remanded for further inquiries
active:  I heard
noverb:  You have him here
noverb:  In the cells
noverb:  Is he quiet
noverb:  Oh
active:  he gives no trouble
active:  he is a dirty scoundrel
noverb:  Dirty
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is all
noverb:  we can do to make him wash his hands
active:  his face is
noverb:  a tinker's
noverb:  Well,
passive: once his case has been settled
active:  he will have a regular prison
active:  bath
active:  and I think
active:  you saw him
active:  you would agree with me
active:  he needed it
active:  I should like to see him very much
active:  Would you
passive: That is easily done
active:  Come this way
active:  You can leave your bag
noverb:  No
active:  I think
active:  I'll take it
noverb:  Very good
active:  Come this way
noverb:  you
active:  He led us down a passage
active:  opened a barred door
novoice: passed down a winding stair
active:  brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
active:  The third on the right is his
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
novoice: glanced through
active:  He is asleep
active:  said he
active:  You can see him very well
noverb:  We
novoice: put our eyes to the grating
noverb:  The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly
noverb:  heavily
active:  He was a middle-sized man
active:  coarsely clad
active:  became his calling
active:  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
active:  He was
active:  the inspector had said
noverb:  extremely dirty
noverb:  the grime
active:  covered his face
active:  could not conceal its repulsive ugliness
active:  A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin
active:  by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip
passive: three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
active:  A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
active:  He's a beauty
noverb:  isn't he
noverb:  said the inspector
active:  He certainly needs a wash
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I had an idea
active:  he might
active:  I took the liberty
active:  bringing the tools with me
active:  He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke
active:  took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge
noverb:  He! he
active:  You are a funny one
active:  chuckled the inspector
noverb:  Now,
active:  you will have the great goodness
active:  to open
noverb:  door very quietly
noverb:  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  not
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells
active:  does he
active:  He slipped his key into the lock
noverb:  we all very quietly entered the cell
active:  The sleeper half turned
novoice: settled down once
noverb:  into a deep slumber
active:  Holmes stooped to the water-jug
active:  moistened his sponge
active:  rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face
noverb:  Let me introduce you
active:  he shouted
noverb:  to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent
noverb:  Never in my life have I seen such a sight
novoice: The man's face peeled off under the sponge
noverb:  the bark from a tree
noverb:  Gone was the coarse brown tint
noverb:  Gone
noverb:  too
active:  was the horrid scar
active:  had seamed it across
noverb:  the twisted lip
active:  had given the repulsive sneer to the face
active:  A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
noverb:  there
novoice: sitting up in his bed
active:  was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man
noverb:  black-haired
noverb:  smooth-skinned
active:  rubbing his eyes
active:  staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
active:  suddenly realising the exposure
active:  he broke into a scream
active:  threw himself down with his face to the pillow
noverb:  Great heavens
active:  cried the inspector
active:  it is
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  the missing man
active:  I know him from the photograph
active:  The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man
active:  abandons himself to his destiny
active:  Be it
active:  said he
active:  And pray
active:  am I charged with
active:  making away with Mr. Neville St.
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
noverb:  you can't be charged with
active:  they make a case of attempted suicide of it
active:  said the inspector with a grin
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have been twenty-seven years in the force
noverb:  this really takes the cake
active:  I am Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  ,
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that no crime has been committed
noverb:  therefore
passive: I am illegally detained
noverb:  No crime
passive: a very great error has been committed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  You would have done better to have trusted you wife
active:  It was not the wife
active:  it was the children
active:  groaned the prisoner
active:  God help me
active:  I would not have them ashamed of their father
noverb:  My God
noverb:  an exposure
active:  can
active:  I do
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch
active:  patted him kindly on the shoulder
active:  you leave it to a court of law
active:  to clear the matter up
active:  said he
active:  course
active:  you can hardly avoid publicity
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  you convince the police authorities
active:  there is no possible case against you
active:  I do not know
active:  there is any reason
noverb:  that the details should find their way into the papers
active:  Inspector Bradstreet would
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , make notes upon anything
active:  you might tell us
active:  submit it to the proper authorities
active:  The case would
active:  never go into court at all
active:  God bless you
active:  cried the prisoner passionately
active:  I would have endured imprisonment
noverb:  ay
noverb:  even execution
noverb:  rather
active:  have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
active:  You are the first
active:  have ever heard my story
active:  My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield
active:  I received an excellent education
active:  I travelled in my youth
active:  took to the stage
active:  finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London
noverb:  One day my editor wished
active:  to have a series of articles
active:  begging in the metropolis
active:  I volunteered to supply them
active:  There was the point
noverb:  from
active:  all my adventures started
active:  It was only
active:  trying begging as an amateur
active:  I could get the facts upon
active:  to base my articles
noverb:  When an actor
active:  I had
noverb:  of course
active:  learned all the secrets
active:  making up
active:  had been famous in the green-room for my skill
active:  I took advantage now of my attainments
active:  I painted my face
active:  to make myself
noverb:  possible I made a good scar
active:  fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster
active:  with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city
noverb:  ostensibly as a match-seller
noverb:  really as a beggar
active:  For seven hours I plied my trade
active:  I returned home in the evening
passive: I found to my surprise
active:  I had received no less than 26s
noverb:  4d
active:  I wrote my articles
active:  thought little
noverb:  of the matter until
noverb:  some time later
active:  I backed a bill for a friend
active:  had a writ served upon me for $25
active:  I was at my wit's end
active:  to get the money
active:  a sudden idea came to me
active:  I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor
novoice: asked for a holiday from my employers
novoice: spent the time
active:  begging in the City under my disguise
active:  In ten days I had the money
active:  had paid the debt
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can imagine
noverb:  hard it was
active:  to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week
active:  I knew
active:  I could earn as much in a day
active:  smearing my face with a little paint
active:  laying my cap on the ground
noverb:  sitting still
active:  It was a long fight between my pride and the money
novoice: the dollars won at last
active:  I threw up reporting
noverb:  sat day after day in the corner
active:  I had first chosen
noverb:  inspiring pity by my ghastly face
active:  filling my pockets with coppers
active:  Only one man knew my secret
active:  He was the keeper
noverb:  of a low den in
active:  I used
active:  to lodge in Swandam Lane
active:  I could
active:  every morning emerge as a squalid beggar
active:  in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town
noverb:  This fellow, a Lascar
passive: was well paid by me for his rooms
active:  I knew
active:  my secret was safe in his possession
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  very soon I found
active:  I was saving considerable sums of money
active:  I do not mean
active:  any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--
active:  I had exceptional advantages in my power
active:  making up
noverb:  also in a facility of repartee
active:  improved by practice
active:  made me quite a recognised character in the City
noverb:  All day a stream of pennies
passive: varied by silver
novoice: poured in upon me
active:  it was a very bad day in
active:  I failed to take $2
active:  I grew richer
active:  I grew more ambitious
active:  took a house in the country
noverb:  eventually married
active:  without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
active:  My dear wife knew
active:  I had business in the City
active:  She little knew
active:  Last Monday I had finished for the day
active:  was dressing in my room above the opium den
active:  I looked out of my window
noverb:  saw
noverb:  to my horror and astonishment
active:  my wife was standing in the street
noverb:  with her eyes fixed full upon me
active:  I gave a cry of surprise
active:  threw up my arms
active:  to cover my face
active:  rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him
active:  to prevent anyone
active:  coming up to me
active:  I heard her voice downstairs
active:  I knew
active:  she could not ascend
active:  Swiftly I threw off my clothes
passive: pulled on those of a beggar
noverb:  put on my pigments and wig
active:  Even a wife's eyes could not pierce
active:  complete a disguise
active:  it occurred to me
active:  there might be a search
noverb:  in the room
active:  the clothes might betray me
noverb:  I threw open the window
active:  reopening by my violence a small cut
active:  I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning
active:  Then I seized my coat
passive: was weighted by the coppers
active:  I had just transferred to
noverb:  it from the leather bag in
active:  I carried my takings
active:  I hurled it out of the window
active:  it disappeared into the Thames
active:  The other clothes would have followed
noverb:  at that moment
active:  there was a rush of constables up the stair
noverb:  a few minutes after I found
noverb:  rather
active:  I confess
noverb:  to my relief
noverb:  instead
passive: being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair
passive: I was arrested as his murderer
active:  I do not know
active:  there is anything
noverb:  else for me
active:  to explain
passive: I was determined
active:  to preserve my disguise
noverb:  possible
noverb:  hence my preference for a dirty face
active:  Knowing
active:  my wife would be terribly anxious
active:  I slipped off my ring
active:  confided it to the Lascar at a moment
active:  no constable was watching me
noverb:  together with a hurried scrawl
active:  telling her
active:  she had no cause
active:  to fear
noverb:  That note only reached her yesterday
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Good God
noverb:  a week
active:  she must have spent
active:  The police have watched this Lascar
active:  said Inspector Bradstreet
active:  and I can quite understand
active:  he might find it difficult
active:  to post a letter unobserved
active:  Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his
active:  forgot all about it for some days
active:  That was it
active:  said Holmes
active:  nodding approvingly
active:  I have no doubt of it
passive: have
passive: you never been prosecuted for begging
noverb:  Many times
active:  was a fine to me
active:  It must stop here
noverb:  however
active:  said Bradstreet
active:  the police are to hush this thing up
active:  there must be no
noverb:  more of Hugh Boone
active:  I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths
active:  a man can take
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that no further steps may be taken
passive: you are found again
noverb:  all must come out
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  we are very much indebted to you
active:  having cleared the matter up
active:  I wish
active:  I knew
active:  you reach your results
active:  I reached this one
active:  said my friend
active:  sitting upon five pillows
active:  consuming an ounce of shag
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we drive to Baker Street
active:  we shall just be in time for breakfast
noverb:  VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
active:  I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas
noverb:  with the intention
noverb:  wishing him the compliments of the season
active:  He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown
noverb:  a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right
noverb:  a pile of crumpled morning papers
noverb:  evidently newly studied
noverb:  near at hand
active:  Beside the couch was a wooden chair
active:  on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
noverb:  disreputable hard-felt hat
noverb:  much the worse for wear
novoice: cracked in several places
noverb:  A lens
noverb:  a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested
passive: the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
passive: You are engaged
active:  said I
active:  perhaps I interrupt you
noverb:  Not at all
active:  I am glad
active:  to have a friend with
active:  I can discuss my results
active:  The matter is a perfectly trivial one
noverb:  --he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--
novoice: there are points in connection with it
active:  are not entirely devoid of interest
noverb:  even of instruction
active:  I seated myself in his armchair
active:  warmed my hands
noverb:  his crackling fire
active:  for a sharp frost had set in
active:  the windows were thick with the ice crystals
active:  I suppose
active:  I remarked
noverb:  homely as it looks
noverb:  this thing has some deadly story linked on to it
active:  it is the clue
noverb:  which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  No crime
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Only one of those whimsical little incidents
active:  will happen
noverb:  you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
noverb:  Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity
passive: every possible combination of events may be expected
active:  to take place
noverb:  many a little problem will be presented
active:  may be striking
noverb:  bizarre
active:  being criminal
active:  We have already had experience of such
noverb:  much
active:  I remarked
noverb:  of the last six cases
active:  I have added to my notes
active:  three have been entirely free of any legal crime
noverb:  Precisely
active:  You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland,
noverb:  to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
active:  You know Peterson, the commissionaire
noverb:  Yes
active:  It is to him
active:  this trophy belongs
active:  It is his hat
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  he found it
active:  Its owner is unknown
active:  I beg
active:  you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
noverb:  as an intellectual problem
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  as to
active:  it came here
active:  It arrived upon Christmas morning
noverb:  in company with a good fat goose
active:  is
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire
active:  The facts are these
noverb:  about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson
active:  you know
active:  is a very honest fellow
active:  was returning from some small jollification
active:  was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road
active:  In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man
noverb:  walking with a slight stagger
active:  carrying a white goose
novoice: slung over his shoulder
active:  he reached the corner of Goodge Street
active:  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs
active:  One of the latter knocked off the man's hat
noverb:  on
active:  he raised his stick
active:  to defend himself
active:  swinging it over his head
active:  smashed the shop window behind him
active:  Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants
noverb:  the man
noverb:  shocked
active:  having broken the window
active:  seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
active:  dropped his goose
active:  took to his heels
novoice: vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets
noverb:  lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road
active:  The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson
passive: he was left in possession of the field of battle
noverb:  also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
active:  surely he restored to their owner
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  there lies the problem
active:  It is true
noverb:  that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card
passive: was tied to the bird's left leg
active:  it is also true
noverb:  that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat
active:  there are some thousands of Bakers
noverb:  ,
noverb:  some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours
active:  it is not easy
active:  to restore lost property to any one of them
active:  did Peterson
active:  do
active:  He brought round
noverb:  hat
noverb:  goose to me on Christmas morning
noverb:  knowing
active:  even the smallest problems are of interest to me
noverb:  The goose
active:  we retained until this morning
active:  there were signs
noverb:  in spite of the slight frost
active:  it would be well
passive: it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
active:  Its finder has carried it off
noverb:  therefore
active:  to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
active:  I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman
active:  lost his Christmas dinner
active:  Did he not advertise
noverb:  No
noverb:  clue could you have as to his identity
noverb:  Only
active:  we can deduce
noverb:  From his hat
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you are joking
active:  can you gather from this old battered felt
active:  Here is my lens
active:  You know my methods
active:  can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man
active:  has worn this article
active:  I took the tattered object in my hands
active:  turned it over rather ruefully
active:  It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape
noverb:  hard
noverb:  much the worse for wear
active:  The lining had been of red silk
passive: was a good deal discoloured
active:  There was no maker's name
active:  Holmes had remarked
noverb:  the initials
noverb:  H. B.
passive: were scrawled upon one side
passive: It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer
active:  the elastic was missing
noverb:  For the rest
passive: it was cracked
noverb:  exceedingly dusty
novoice: spotted in several places
novoice: there seemed
active:  to have been some attempt
active:  to hide the discoloured patches
active:  smearing them with ink
active:  I can see nothing
active:  said I
active:  handing it back to my friend
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  Watson
active:  you can see everything
active:  You fail
noverb:  however
active:  to reason from
active:  you see
active:  You are too timid
noverb:  in drawing your inferences
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  it is
active:  you can infer from this hat
active:  He picked it up
active:  gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
active:  was characteristic of him
active:  It is perhaps less suggestive
noverb:  than it might
passive: have been
active:  he remarked
noverb:  and
active:  there are a few inferences
noverb:  which are very distinct
noverb:  a few others
active:  represent at least a strong balance of probability
active:  the man was highly intellectual
active:  is of course obvious upon the face of it
noverb:  also
active:  he was fairly well-to
noverb:  -do within the last three years
active:  he has now fallen upon evil days
active:  He had foresight
novoice: has less now
noverb:  formerly
active:  pointing to a moral retrogression
passive: taken with the decline of his fortunes
active:  seems to indicate some evil influence
noverb:  probably drink
noverb:  at work upon him
active:  This may account also for the obvious fact
active:  his wife has ceased to love him
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  He has
noverb:  however
active:  retained some degree of self-respect
active:  he continued
active:  disregarding my remonstrance
active:  He is a man
noverb:  who leads a sedentary life
active:  goes out little
active:  is out of training entirely
active:  is middle-aged
active:  has grizzled hair
active:  he has
active:  had cut within the last few days
active:  he anoints with lime-cream
noverb:  These are the more patent facts
active:  are to be deduced from his hat
noverb:  Also,
noverb:  by the way
active:  it is extremely improbable
noverb:  that he has gas laid on in his house
active:  You are certainly joking
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Is it possible
noverb:  even now
noverb:  I give you these results
active:  you are unable
active:  to see
passive: they are attained
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am very stupid
active:  I must confess
active:  I am unable
active:  to follow you
noverb:  For example
active:  did you deduce
active:  this man was intellectual
active:  For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head
active:  It came right over the forehead
novoice: settled upon the bridge of his nose
active:  It is a question of cubic capacity
active:  said he
noverb:  a man with
noverb:  large a brain must have something in it
noverb:  The decline of his fortunes
active:  This hat is three years old
passive: These flat brims curled
active:  at the edge came in
active:  It is a hat of the very best quality
noverb:  Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining
active:  this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago
active:  has had no hat
active:  he has assuredly gone down in the world
noverb:  Well,
active:  is clear enough
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  about the foresight and the moral retrogression
active:  Sherlock Holmes laughed
active:  Here is the foresight
active:  said
active:  he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
passive: They are never sold upon hats
active:  this man ordered one
active:  it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight
active:  he went out of his way
active:  to take this precaution against the wind
active:  we see
active:  he has broken the elastic
active:  has not troubled to replace it
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that he has less foresight now
noverb:  formerly
active:  is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt
active:  daubing them with ink
active:  is a sign
active:  he has not entirely lost his self-respect
active:  Your reasoning is certainly plausible
noverb:  The further points
active:  he is middle-aged
noverb:  ,
passive: his hair is grizzled
passive: it has been recently cut
noverb:  he uses lime-cream
noverb:  , are all
passive: to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining
active:  The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends
noverb:  clean cut by the scissors of the barber
noverb:  They all appear to be adhesive
active:  there is a distinct odour of lime-cream
noverb:  This dust
active:  you will observe
active:  is not the gritty, grey dust of the street
noverb:  the fluffy brown dust of the house
active:  showing
passive: it has been hung up indoors
noverb:  of the time
noverb:  the marks of moisture upon the
active:  are proof positive
active:  the wearer perspired very freely
active:  could therefore
active:  hardly be in the best of training
noverb:  his wife
active:  you said
active:  she had ceased to love him
passive: This hat has not been brushed for weeks
active:  When I see you
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat
active:  your wife allows you
active:  to go out in such a state
active:  I shall fear
active:  you also have been unfortunate enough
active:  to lose your wife's affection
active:  he might be a bachelor
noverb:  Nay,
active:  he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife
active:  Remember the card upon the bird's leg
active:  You have an answer to everything
noverb:  on earth do you deduce
passive: the gas is not laid on in his house
active:  One tallow stain
noverb:  even two
active:  might come by chance
active:  I see no less than five
active:  I think
active:  there can be little doubt
passive: the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow
noverb:  walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet
active:  Are you satisfied
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is very ingenious
active:  said I
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  as you said just now
active:  there has been no crime committed
active:  no harm done save the loss of a goose
noverb:  all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
active:  Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth
active:  to reply
active:  the door flew open
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  the commissionaire
active:  rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man
passive: is dazed with astonishment
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  sir
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Eh
noverb:  of it
active:  Has it returned to life
novoice: flapped off through the kitchen window
noverb:  Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa
active:  to get a fairer view of the man's excited face
noverb:  See here
noverb:  sir
noverb:  See
passive: my wife found in its crop
active:  He held out his hand
active:  displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone
noverb:  rather smaller
noverb:  a bean in size
noverb:  of such purity and radiance
active:  it twinkled
noverb:  an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle
noverb:  By Jove
noverb:  Peterson
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  this is treasure trove indeed
active:  I suppose
active:  you know
active:  you have got
noverb:  A diamond
noverb:  sir
noverb:  A precious stone
active:  It cuts into glass as
active:  it were putty
active:  It's more than a precious stone
active:  It is the precious stone
noverb:  Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  Precisely
active:  I ought to know its size
noverb:  shape
noverb:  seeing
active:  I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately
active:  It is absolutely unique
noverb:  ,
passive: its value can only be conjectured
passive: the reward offered
active:  of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
noverb:  A thousand pounds
noverb:  Great Lord of mercy
novoice: The commissionaire plumped down into a chair
novoice: stared from one to the other of us
active:  That is the reward
active:  I have reason

noverb:  Very glad
active:  to see you

active:  said he
noverb:  rising from his armchair
active:  greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality

active:  readily assume
noverb:  Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker

novoice: with the collar turned up
active:  his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
active:  He spoke in a slow staccato fashion
active:  choosing his words with care
active:  gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters
active:  had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune
active:  We have retained these things for some days
active:  said Holmes
active:  we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address
active:  I am at a loss
active:  to know now
active:  you did not advertise
active:  Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
active:  Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
active:  he remarked
active:  I had no doubt
noverb:  the gang of roughs
noverb:  assaulted me had carried off
noverb:  my hat and the bird
active:  I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt
active:  recovering them
noverb:  Very naturally
passive: By the way, about the bird, we were compelled
active:  to eat it
active:  To eat it
noverb:  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would have been
active:  of no use to anyone had we not done
active:  But I presume
noverb:  this other goose upon the sideboard
active:  is about the same weight
noverb:  perfectly fresh
active:  will answer your purpose equally well
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  certainly
active:  answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief
noverb:  Of course
active:  we still have the feathers, legs, crop
noverb:  on of your own bird
noverb:  you wish
noverb:  The man burst into a hearty laugh
active:  They might be useful
noverb:  to me as relics of my adventure

noverb:  sir

active:  There is your hat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  there your bird
active:  said he
noverb:  By the way
active:  would it bore you
active:  to tell me

noverb:  sir

noverb:  to you
noverb:  sir
passive: for a Scotch bonnet is fitted
noverb:  to my years nor my gravity
active:  With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to
noverb:  of us
novoice: strode off upon his way
noverb:  much for Mr. Henry Baker
active:  said Holmes
active:  he had closed the door behind him
active:  It is quite certain
noverb:  that he knows nothing
noverb:  about the matter
active:  Are you hungry
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  Not particularly
active:  I suggest
active:  we turn our dinner into a supper
active:  follow up this clue
active:  it is still hot
noverb:  By all means
active:  It was a bitter night
active:  we drew on our ulsters
active:  wrapped cravats about our throats
active:  the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky
active:  the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
noverb:  so many pistol shots
active:  Our footfalls rang out crisply
noverb:  loudly
active:  we swung through the doctors' quarter
noverb:  Wimpole Street
noverb:  Harley Street
noverb:  through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street

active:  said he
noverb:  My geese
active:  The man seemed surprised
noverb:  Yes
active:  I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker

noverb:  Now for Mr. Breckinridge
active:  he continued
active:  buttoning up his coat
active:  we came out into the frosty air
active:  Remember
noverb:  Watson
active:  we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain
active:  we have at the other a man
active:  will certainly get seven years' penal servitude
active:  we can establish his innocence
active:  It is possible
noverb:  that our inquiry may
active:  confirm his guilt
active:  , in any case, we have a line of investigation
passive: has been missed by the police
active:  a singular chance has placed in our hands
noverb:  Let us follow it out to the bitter end
noverb:  Faces to the south

novoice: The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
passive: Sold out of geese
active:  I see

noverb:  pointing at the bare slabs of marble
novoice: Let
active:  you have five hundred to-morrow morning

noverb:  on the stall with the gas-flare
noverb:  Ah
passive: I was recommended to
noverb:  you
noverb:  by
noverb:  The landlord of the Alpha
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  I sent him a couple of dozen
noverb:  Fine birds they were
noverb:  too
active:  Now where did you get them from
active:  To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  mister
active:  said he
novoice: with his head cocked
noverb:  his arms akimbo
active:  are you driving at
noverb:  Let's have it straight
noverb:  now
active:  It is straight enough
active:  I should like to know

noverb:  Well
noverb:  I shan't tell you
noverb:  now
noverb:  Oh

active:  they were the only geese
noverb:  in the world
active:  to hear the fuss
passive: is made over them
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no connection with any other people
active:  have been making inquiries
active:  said Holmes carelessly
noverb:  you won't tell us
active:  the bet is off
active:  that is all
noverb:  I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls
active:  I have a fiver on it
noverb:  the bird
active:  I ate
active:  is country
novoice: bred
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  you've lost your fiver
noverb:  for it's town

active:  It's nothing of the kind
active:  I say
active:  it is
noverb:  I don't believe it
noverb:  D'you think
active:  you know more about fowls
noverb:  I
active:  have handled them

noverb:  for I know
active:  I am right
active:  But I'll have a sovereign on with you
noverb:  just
active:  to teach you not
active:  to be obstinate
active:  The salesman chuckled grimly
noverb:  Bring me the books
noverb:  Bill
active:  said he
active:  The small boy brought round a small thin volume
noverb:  a great greasy-backed one
active:  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
noverb:  Now
noverb:  Mr. Cocksure
active:  said the salesman
active:  I thought
active:  I was out of geese
active:  I finish
active:  you'll find
active:  there is still one left in my shop
active:  You see this little book
noverb:  Well
active:  That's the list of the folk from

active:  Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined
active:  He drew a sovereign from his pocket
active:  threw it down upon the slab
noverb:  turning away with the air of a man
active:  disgust is too deep for words
noverb:  A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post
active:  laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  When you see a man with whiskers of
noverb:  cut
noverb:  the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket
active:  you can always draw him by a bet
active:  said he
active:  I daresay
active:  I had put $100 down in front of him
noverb:  that man would not have given me such complete information
passive: was drawn from him by the idea
active:  he was doing me on a wager
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we are
active:  I fancy
active:  nearing the end of our quest
noverb:  the only point

noverb:  about the matter
active:  I should
passive: His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub
active:  broke out from the stall
active:  we had just left
noverb:  Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
passive: was thrown by the swinging lamp
noverb:  Breckinridge
noverb:  the salesman
active:  framed in the door of his stall
active:  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
noverb:  I've had enough of you and your geese
active:  he shouted

noverb:  at the devil together
active:  you come
active:  pestering me any

active:  have you
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  Did I buy the geese off you
noverb:  No

active:  She told me
active:  to ask you
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can ask the King of Proosia
noverb:  for all I care
noverb:  I've had enough of it
active:  Get out of this
active:  He rushed fiercely forward

passive: every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
active:  are you
noverb:  do you want

active:  You will excuse me
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  I could not help
active:  overhearing the questions

active:  I think
active:  I could be of assistance to you

noverb:  interested I am in this matter
active:  Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler
active:  was passing
noverb:  In

noverb:  in this wind-swept market-place
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  we go farther
active:  it is
active:  I have the pleasure

noverb:  of a catastrophe

noverb:  they all open out into the same corridor
noverb:  Do I make myself plain
noverb:  Perfectly
active:  The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
active:  fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early
active:  we knew
active:  he had not retired
active:  to rest
passive: for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars
active:  it was his custom
active:  to smoke
active:  She left her room
noverb:  therefore
active:  came into mine
active:  she sat for some time
active:  chatting about her approaching wedding
noverb:  At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me
active:  she paused at the door
active:  looked back
noverb:  Tell me, Helen,' said
noverb:  she
active:  have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night
noverb:  Never,
active:  said I.
active:  I suppose
active:  you could not possibly whistle
noverb:  yourself
noverb:  in your sleep
noverb:  Certainly not
noverb:  during the last few nights
active:  I have always
noverb:  about three in the morning
active:  heard a low
noverb:  clear whistle
active:  I am a light sleeper
active:  it has awakened me
active:  I cannot tell
active:  it came from
noverb:  perhaps from the next room
noverb:  perhaps from the lawn
active:  I thought
active:  I would just ask you
active:  you had heard it
noverb:  No
active:  I have not
active:  It must be those wretched gipsies
noverb:  in the plantation
noverb:  Very likely
noverb:  And yet
active:  it were on the lawn
active:  I wonder
active:  you did not hear it also
noverb:  Ah
active:  I sleep more heavily
noverb:  you
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is of no great consequence
noverb:  at any rate
active:  She smiled back at me
active:  closed my door
noverb:  a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock
noverb:  Indeed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Was it your custom always
active:  to lock yourselves in at night
noverb:  Always
noverb:  And
active:  I think
active:  I mentioned to
noverb:  you
active:  the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon
active:  We had no feeling of security
passive: our doors were locked
noverb:  Quite
active:  Pray
active:  proceed with your statement
active:  I could not sleep that night
active:  A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me
noverb:  My sister
noverb:  I
active:  you will recollect
active:  were twins
active:  you know
noverb:  subtle are the links
active:  bind two souls
active:  are
noverb:  closely allied
active:  It was a wild night
active:  The wind was howling
active:  the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  amid all the hubbub of the gale
active:  there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman
active:  I knew
active:  it was my sister's voice
active:  I sprang from my bed
active:  wrapped a shawl
active:  round me
novoice: rushed into the corridor
active:  As I opened my door
active:  I seemed to hear a low whistle
noverb:  such as my sister described
noverb:  a few moments later a clanging sound
noverb:  as
active:  a mass of metal had fallen
active:  As I ran down the passage
passive: my sister's door was unlocked
passive: revolved slowly upon its hinges
active:  I stared at it horror-stricken
active:  not knowing
active:  was about
active:  to issue from
noverb:  it
active:  By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister
active:  appear at the opening
novoice: her face blanched with terror
noverb:  her hands groping for help
noverb:  her whole figure swaying to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  of a drunkard
active:  I ran to her
active:  threw my arms
active:  round her
novoice: at that moment her knees seemed
active:  to give way
active:  she fell to the ground
active:  She writhed as one
active:  is in terrible pain
passive: her limbs were dreadfully convulsed
noverb:  At first I thought
active:  she had not recognised me
noverb:  as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice
active:  I shall never forget
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  my God
noverb:  Helen
active:  It was the band
noverb:  The speckled band
active:  There was something
noverb:  else
noverb:  she would fain have said
active:  she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room
active:  a fresh convulsion seized her
noverb:  choked her words
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  calling loudly for my stepfather
active:  I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown
active:  When he reached my sister's side
active:  she was unconscious
noverb:  ,
active:  he poured brandy down her throat
novoice: sent for medical aid from the village
active:  all efforts were in vain
noverb:  for she slowly sank and died
noverb:  having recovered her consciousness
active:  Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
noverb:  One moment
active:  said Holmes
active:  are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
active:  Could you swear to
noverb:  it
active:  That was
active:  the county coroner asked me at the inquiry
active:  It is my strong impression
noverb:  that I heard it
noverb:  among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house
passive: I may possibly have been deceived
noverb:  Was your sister dressed
noverb:  No
active:  she was in her night-dress
active:  In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match
noverb:  in her left a match-box
active:  Showing
active:  she had struck a light
novoice: looked about her
active:  the alarm took place
active:  That is important
noverb:  And
noverb:  conclusions did the coroner come to
active:  He investigated the case with great care
novoice: for Dr. Roylott's conduct had
active:  long been notorious in the county
active:  he was unable
active:  to find any satisfactory cause of death
active:  My evidence showed
passive: the door had been fastened upon the inner side
passive: the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
passive: were secured every night
passive: The walls were carefully sounded
passive: were shown
active:  to be quite solid all round
passive: the flooring was also thoroughly examined
noverb:  with the same result
active:  The chimney is wide
passive: is barred up by four large staples
active:  It is certain
noverb:  , therefore
active:  my sister was quite alone
noverb:  she met her end
noverb:  Besides
active:  there were no marks
noverb:  of any violence upon her
noverb:  about poison
active:  The doctors examined her for it
noverb:  without success
active:  do you think
active:  this unfortunate lady died of
active:  It is my belief
noverb:  that she died of pure fear
noverb:  nervous shock
active:  it was
noverb:  frightened her I cannot imagine
noverb:  Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
noverb:  Yes
active:  there are nearly always some
noverb:  there
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  did you gather from this allusion to a band
noverb:  a speckled band
active:  Sometimes I have thought
active:  it was merely the wild talk of delirium
noverb:  sometimes
active:  it may have referred to some band of people
noverb:  perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
active:  I do not know
noverb:  the spotted handkerchiefs
noverb:  so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective
active:  she used
active:  Holmes shook his head like a man
noverb:  who is far
noverb:  from being satisfied
noverb:  These are very deep waters
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  go on with your narrative
active:  Two years have passed
novoice: my life has been until lately lonelier
noverb:  A month ago
noverb:  however
noverb:  a dear friend
active:  I have known for many years
noverb:  has done me the honour
active:  to ask my hand in marriage
active:  His name is Armitage
noverb:  Percy Armitage
noverb:  the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading
active:  My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match
active:  we are to be married in the course of the spring
noverb:  Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building
passive: my bedroom wall has been pierced
active:  I have had
active:  to move into the chamber in
novoice: my sister died
active:  to sleep in the very bed in
active:  she slept
active:  Imagine
noverb:  my thrill of terror
noverb:  last night
noverb:  as I lay awake
noverb:  thinking over her terrible fate
novoice: I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle
active:  had been the herald of her own death
active:  I sprang up
active:  lit the lamp
active:  nothing was to be seen in the room
active:  I was too shaken
active:  to go
active:  to bed again
noverb:  however
active:  I dressed
active:  it was daylight
active:  I slipped down
active:  got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn
active:  is opposite
active:  drove to Leatherhead
noverb:  from whence I have come on this morning with the one object
active:  seeing you
active:  asking your advice
active:  You have done wisely
active:  said my friend
active:  have you told me all
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  all
noverb:  Miss Roylott
active:  you have not
active:  You are screening your stepfather
noverb:  do you mean
active:  For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace
active:  fringed the hand
active:  lay upon our visitor's knee
noverb:  Five little livid spots
noverb:  the marks of four fingers and a thumb
passive: were printed upon the white wrist
passive: You have been cruelly used
active:  said Holmes
active:  The lady coloured deeply
novoice: covered over her injured wrist
active:  He is a hard man
active:  she said
active:  and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
active:  There was a long silence
noverb:  during
active:  Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands
novoice: stared into the crackling fire
active:  This is a very deep business
active:  he said at last
active:  There are a thousand details
active:  I should desire to know
active:  I decide upon our course of action
active:  Yet we have not a moment
active:  to lose
active:  we were
active:  to come to Stoke Moran to-day
active:  would
active:  it be possible
noverb:  for us
active:  to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
active:  it happens
noverb:  he spoke
active:  coming into town to-day upon some most important business
active:  It is probable
noverb:  that he will be away all day
active:  there would be nothing
active:  to disturb you
active:  We have a housekeeper now
active:  she is old and foolish
active:  I could easily get her out of the way
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You are not averse
noverb:  to this trip, Watson
noverb:  By no means
active:  we shall
active:  come
active:  are you going to do yourself
active:  I have one or two things
active:  I would wish to do now
active:  I am in town
active:  But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train
active:  to be there in time for your coming
active:  And you may expect us early in the afternoon
noverb:  I have myself some small business matters
active:  to attend to
active:  Will you not wait and breakfast
noverb:  No
active:  I must go
passive: My heart is lightened already
active:  I have confided my trouble to you
noverb:  I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
active:  She dropped her thick black veil over her face
novoice: glided from the room
noverb:  And
noverb:  do you think of it all
noverb:  Watson
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  It seems to me
active:  to be a most dark and sinister business
noverb:  Dark enough
noverb:  sinister enough
noverb:  Yet
active:  the lady is correct
active:  saying
noverb:  the flooring
active:  walls are sound
active:  the door, window, and chimney are impassable
active:  her sister must have been undoubtedly alone
noverb:  she met her mysterious end
active:  becomes
noverb:  , of these nocturnal whistles,
noverb:  of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
active:  I cannot think
active:  When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
noverb:  the presence of a band of gipsies
active:  are on intimate terms with this old doctor
noverb:  the fact
active:  we have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  the doctor has an interest
active:  preventing his stepdaughter's marriage
noverb:  the dying allusion to a band
noverb:  finally
noverb:  the fact
novoice: Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang
passive: might have been caused by one of those metal bars
active:  secured the shutters falling back into its place
active:  I think
passive: there is good ground
active:  to think
passive: the mystery may be cleared along those lines
active:  did the gipsies
active:  do
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  I see many objections to any such theory
noverb:  And
active:  do
active:  I. It is precisely for
noverb:  reason
active:  we are going to Stoke Moran this day
active:  I want
active:  to see
active:  the objections are fatal
passive: they may be explained away
noverb:  in the name of the devil
passive: The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact
active:  our door had been suddenly dashed open
active:  a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
active:  His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional
noverb:  of the agricultural
active:  having a black top-hat
noverb:  , a long frock-coat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a pair of high gaiters
noverb:  with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand
noverb:  So tall was he
active:  his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway
active:  his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
noverb:  A large face
passive: seared with a thousand wrinkles
noverb:  burned yellow with the sun
novoice: marked with every evil passion
passive: was turned from one to the other of us
noverb:  his deep-set, bile-shot eyes
noverb:  his high
noverb:  thin
noverb:  fleshless nose
noverb:  gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
noverb:  of
active:  you is Holmes
active:  asked this apparition
noverb:  My name
noverb:  sir
active:  you have the advantage of me
active:  said my companion quietly
active:  I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  , of Stoke Moran
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said Holmes blandly
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  I will do nothing of the kind
active:  My stepdaughter has been here
active:  I have traced her
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  It is a little cold for the time of the year
active:  said Holmes
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  screamed the old man furiously
active:  I have heard
noverb:  the crocuses promise well
active:  continued my companion imperturbably
noverb:  Ha
active:  You put me off
active:  do you
active:  said
noverb:  our new visitor
active:  taking a step forward
active:  shaking his hunting-crop
active:  I know you
noverb:  you scoundrel
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you before
active:  You are Holmes, the meddler
active:  My friend smiled
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the busybody
active:  His smile broadened
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office
active:  Holmes chuckled heartily
active:  Your conversation is most entertaining
active:  said he
active:  When you go out close the door
active:  for there is a decided draught
active:  I will go
active:  I have said my say
noverb:  Don't you dare
active:  to meddle with my affairs
active:  I know
active:  Miss Stoner has been here
active:  I traced her
active:  I am a dangerous man
active:  to fall foul of
noverb:  See here
active:  He stepped swiftly forward
active:  seized the poker
active:  bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
active:  See
active:  you keep yourself out of my grip
active:  he snarled
active:  hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace
active:  he strode out of the room
active:  He seems a very amiable person
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I am not quite so bulky
active:  he had remained
active:  I might have shown him
active:  my grip was not much more feeble
noverb:  his own
active:  he spoke
active:  he picked up the steel poker
active:  , with a sudden effort, straightened it out again
noverb:  Fancy his having the insolence
active:  to confound me with the official detective force
noverb:  This incident gives zest to our investigation
noverb:  however
noverb:  I only trust
active:  our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence
active:  allowing this brute
active:  to trace her
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall order breakfast
active:  afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons
active:  I hope to get some data
active:  may help us in this matter
active:  It was nearly one
noverb:  o'clock
novoice: Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion
active:  He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper
noverb:  scrawled over with notes and figures
active:  I have seen the will of the deceased wife
active:  said he
active:  To determine its exact meaning
passive: I have been obliged
active:  to work out the present prices of the investments with
passive: it is concerned
noverb:  The total income
active:  at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100
active:  is now
noverb:  through the fall in agricultural prices
noverb:  not more than $750
active:  Each daughter can claim an income of $250
noverb:  in case of marriage
active:  It is evident
noverb:  , therefore
active:  both girls had married
active:  this beauty would have had a mere pittance
active:  even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
passive: My morning's work has not been wasted
active:  it has proved
active:  he has the very strongest motives
active:  standing in the way of anything of the sort
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  this is too serious for dawdling
noverb:  especially
active:  the old man is aware
active:  we are interesting ourselves in his affairs
active:  you are ready
noverb:  , we shall call a cab
noverb:  drive to Waterloo
active:  I should be very much obliged
active:  you would slip your revolver into your pocket
noverb:  An Eley's No
active:  2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
active:  can twist steel pokers into knots
active:  a tooth-brush are
active:  I think
noverb:  all
active:  we need
noverb:  At Waterloo
active:  we were fortunate
noverb:  in catching a train for Leatherhead
active:  we hired a trap at the station inn
active:  drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes
active:  It was a perfect day
noverb:  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
noverb:  The trees
active:  wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots
active:  the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
noverb:  To me at least
active:  there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon
passive: we were engaged
noverb:  My companion sat in the front of the trap
noverb:  his arms folded
active:  his hat pulled down over his eyes
active:  his chin sunk upon his breast
active:  buried in the deepest thought
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  he started
active:  tapped me on the shoulder
novoice: pointed over the meadows
noverb:  Look there
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
noverb:  thickening into a grove at the highest point
noverb:  From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
noverb:  high roof-tree of a very old mansion
noverb:  Stoke Moran
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  remarked the driver
active:  There is some building going on there
active:  said Holmes
active:  that is
active:  we are going
active:  There's the village
active:  said the driver
active:  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left
active:  you want
active:  to get to the house
active:  you'll find it shorter
active:  to get over this stile
noverb:  by the foot-path over the fields
noverb:  There
active:  it is
active:  the lady is walking
noverb:  And the lady
active:  I fancy
active:  is Miss Stoner
active:  observed Holmes
active:  shading his eyes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I think
active:  we had
active:  better do
active:  you suggest
active:  We got off
active:  paid our fare
active:  the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
active:  I thought it as well
active:  said Holmes
active:  we climbed the stile
active:  this fellow should think
active:  we had come here as architects
noverb:  on some definite business
active:  It may stop his gossip
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  You see
active:  we have been
noverb:  our word
active:  Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
noverb:  spoke her joy
active:  I have been waiting
noverb:  eagerly for you
active:  she cried
noverb:  shaking hands with us warmly
noverb:  All has turned out splendidly
active:  Dr. Roylott has gone to town
active:  it is unlikely
noverb:  that he will be back
noverb:  before evening
active:  We have had the pleasure
active:  making the doctor's acquaintance
active:  said Holmes
active:  in a few words he sketched out
active:  had occurred
active:  Miss Stoner turned white to the lips
active:  she listened
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  she cried
active:  he has followed me
active:  it appears
active:  He is so cunning
noverb:  that I never know
active:  I am safe
noverb:  from him
active:  will he say
active:  he returns
active:  He must guard himself
noverb:  for he may find
active:  there is someone
noverb:  more cunning
noverb:  himself upon his track
active:  You must lock yourself up from him to-night
active:  he is violent
noverb:  , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow
noverb:  Now,
active:  we must make the best use of our time
noverb:  kindly take us at once to the rooms
active:  we are
active:  to examine
active:  The building was of grey
noverb:  lichen-blotched stone
noverb:  with a high central portion
active:  two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side
passive: In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards
passive: the roof was partly caved in
noverb:  a picture of ruin
active:  The central portion was in little better repair
active:  the right-hand block was comparatively modern
noverb:  the blinds in the windows
active:  with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys
active:  showed
active:  this was
active:  the family resided
passive: Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall
passive: the stone-work had been broken into
active:  there were no signs
noverb:  of any workmen at the moment of our visit
active:  Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn
active:  examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
noverb:  This
active:  I take it
active:  belongs to the room in
noverb:  you used
active:  to sleep
noverb:  the centre one to your sister's
noverb:  the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber
noverb:  Exactly
active:  But I am now sleeping in the middle one
active:  Pending the alterations
active:  I understand
noverb:  By the way
active:  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at
noverb:  end wall
active:  There were none
active:  I believe
active:  it was an excuse
active:  to move me from my room
noverb:  Ah!
active:  is suggestive
noverb:  Now,
active:  on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from
active:  these three rooms open
active:  There are windows
noverb:  in it
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  very small ones
noverb:  Too narrow for anyone
active:  to pass through
noverb:  As you
active:  locked your doors at night
active:  your rooms were unapproachable from
noverb:  side
noverb:  Now,
active:  would you have the kindness
active:  to go into your room
noverb:  bar your shutters
active:  Miss Stoner did
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  after a careful examination through the open window
active:  endeavoured in every way
active:  to force the shutter open
noverb:  without success
active:  There was no slit through
passive: a knife could be passed
active:  to raise the bar
noverb:  with his lens
active:  he tested the hinges
active:  they were of solid iron
active:  built firmly into the massive masonry
noverb:  Hum
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  scratching his chin in some perplexity
active:  my theory certainly presents some difficulties
active:  No one could pass these shutters
passive: they were bolted
noverb:  Well,
active:  we shall see
noverb:  the inside throws any light upon the matter
passive: A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from
active:  the three bedrooms opened
active:  Holmes refused
active:  to examine the third chamber
active:  we passed at once to the second
noverb:  in
active:  Miss Stoner was now sleeping
noverb:  in
active:  her sister had met with her fate
active:  It was a homely little room
noverb:  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace
noverb:  after the fashion of old country-houses
active:  A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner
noverb:  a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another
noverb:  a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window
active:  These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre
noverb:  The boards round
active:  the panelling of the walls were of brown
noverb:  worm-eaten oak
noverb:  old
active:  discoloured
active:  it may have dated from the original building of the house
active:  Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner
active:  sat silent
active:  his eyes travelled round
noverb:  round
noverb:  up and down
noverb:  taking in every detail of the apartment
active:  Where does
active:  bell communicate with
active:  he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope
active:  hung down beside the bed
active:  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
active:  It goes to the housekeeper's room
active:  It looks newer
noverb:  the other things
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  it was only put there a couple of years ago
novoice: Your sister asked for
noverb:  it
active:  I suppose
noverb:  No
active:  I never heard of her using it
active:  We used always to get
active:  we wanted for ourselves
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it seemed unnecessary
active:  to put
noverb:  nice a bell-pull there
active:  You will excuse me for a few minutes
active:  I satisfy myself as to this floor
active:  He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
active:  crawled swiftly backward and forward
active:  examining minutely the cracks between the boards
active:  he did the same with the wood-work with
passive: the chamber was panelled
active:  Finally he walked over to the bed
novoice: spent some time
active:  staring at
noverb:  it
active:  running his eye up and down the wall
active:  Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand
noverb:  gave it a brisk tug
active:  it's a dummy
active:  said he
noverb:  Won't
active:  it ring
noverb:  No
passive: it is not even attached to a wire
active:  This is very interesting
active:  You can see now
passive: it is fastened to a hook just above
active:  the little opening for the ventilator is
noverb:  very absurd
active:  I never noticed
noverb:  before
noverb:  Very strange
active:  muttered Holmes
noverb:  pulling at the rope
noverb:  There are one or two very singular points about this room
noverb:  For example
noverb:  a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
active:  , with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the
noverb:  air
active:  That is also quite modern
active:  said the lady
active:  Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  there were several little changes carried out about
noverb:  time
active:  They seem
novoice: to have been of a most interesting character
noverb:  dummy bell-ropes
noverb:  ventilators
active:  do not ventilate
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
active:  Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger
noverb:  of his step-daughter
active:  was as plainly furnished
noverb:  A camp-bed
noverb:  a small wooden shelf full of books
noverb:  , mostly of a technical character
noverb:  an armchair beside the bed
active:  a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron
active:  safe were the principal things
active:  met the eye
active:  Holmes walked slowly round
novoice: examined each
noverb:  all of them with the keenest interest
active:  What's in here
active:  he asked
active:  tapping the safe
noverb:  My stepfather's business papers
noverb:  Oh! you have seen inside
noverb:  Only once
noverb:  some years ago
active:  I remember
active:  it was full
noverb:  of papers
noverb:  There isn't a cat in it
noverb:  for example
noverb:  No
noverb:  a strange idea
noverb:  Well,
active:  look at this
active:  He took up a small saucer of milk
novoice: stood on the top of it
noverb:  No
noverb:  we don't keep a cat
active:  there is a cheetah and a baboon
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Well,
active:  a cheetah is just a big cat
active:  a saucer of milk does not go very far
active:  satisfying its wants
active:  I daresay
active:  There is one point
active:  I should wish
active:  to determine
active:  He squatted down in front of the wooden chair
active:  examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
active:  Thank you
active:  That is quite settled
active:  said he
active:  rising and putting his lens in his pocket
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Here is something interesting
noverb:  The object
active:  had caught
noverb:  his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
noverb:  The lash
noverb:  however
active:  was curled upon itself
noverb:  tied
active:  to make a loop of whipcord
noverb:  do you make of
noverb:  Watson
active:  It's a common enough lash
noverb:  But I don't know
passive: it should be tied
active:  That is not quite
noverb:  common
active:  is it
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  me! it's a wicked world
active:  a clever man turns his brains
active:  to crime
active:  it is the worst of all
active:  I think
active:  I have seen enough now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
noverb:  with your permission
active:  we shall walk out upon the lawn
active:  I had never seen my friend's face so grim
noverb:  his brow
noverb:  dark
active:  it was
active:  we turned from the scene of this investigation
active:  We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking
active:  to break in upon his thoughts
active:  he roused himself from his reverie
active:  It is very essential
noverb:  , Miss Stoner
active:  said he
active:  you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
active:  I shall most certainly do
active:  The matter is too serious for any hesitation
active:  Your life may depend upon your compliance
active:  I assure you
active:  I am in your hands
noverb:  In the first place
noverb:  my friend
active:  I must spend the night in your room
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  I gazed at him in astonishment
noverb:  Yes
active:  it must be
noverb:  Let me explain
active:  I believe
active:  is the village inn over there
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is the Crown
noverb:  Very good
active:  Your windows would be visible from there
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
active:  your stepfather comes back
noverb:  you hear him retire for the night
active:  you must open the shutters of your window
active:  undo the hasp
noverb:  put your lamp there as a signal to us
active:  withdraw quietly with everything
active:  you are likely
active:  to want into the room
active:  you used
active:  to occupy
active:  I have no doubt
active:  , in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  easily
noverb:  The rest
active:  you will leave in our hands
active:  will
active:  you do
active:  We shall spend the night in your room
active:  we shall investigate the cause of this noise
active:  has disturbed you
active:  I believe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have already made up your mind
active:  said Miss Stoner
active:  laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
active:  Perhaps I have
active:  , for pity's sake, tell me
active:  was the cause of my sister's death
active:  I should prefer to have clearer proofs
active:  I speak
active:  You can at least tell me
active:  my own thought is correct
active:  she died from some sudden fright
noverb:  No
active:  I do not think
active:  I think
active:  there was probably some
noverb:  more tangible cause
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we must leave you for
novoice: Dr. Roylott returned and saw us
active:  our journey would be in vain
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  be brave
noverb:  for
active:  you will do
active:  I have told you
active:  you may rest assured
noverb:  we shall soon drive away the dangers
active:  threaten you
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  engaging a bedroom
noverb:  sitting-room at the Crown Inn
active:  They were on the upper floor
noverb:  from our window
active:  we could command a view of the avenue gate
noverb:  of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House
active:  At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  drive past
active:  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad
active:  drove him
active:  The boy had some slight difficulty
active:  undoing the heavy iron gates
active:  we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice
active:  saw the fury with
active:  he shook his clinched fists at him
active:  The trap drove on
noverb:  a few minutes later we saw a sudden light
active:  spring up among the trees
passive: the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness
active:  I have really some scruples as
active:  to taking you to-night
active:  There is a distinct element of danger
active:  Can I be of assistance
active:  Your presence might be invaluable
active:  I shall certainly come
active:  It is very kind
noverb:  of you
active:  You speak of danger
active:  You have evidently seen more in these rooms
active:  was visible to me
noverb:  No
active:  I fancy
active:  I may have deduced a little
active:  I imagine
active:  you saw all
active:  I did
noverb:  I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope
noverb:  purpose
active:  could answer
active:  I confess
active:  is more than
active:  I can imagine
active:  You saw the ventilator
noverb:  too
noverb:  Yes
active:  I do not think
active:  it is such
noverb:  a very unusual thing
active:  to have a small
active:  opening between two rooms
active:  It was so small
noverb:  that a rat could hardly pass through
active:  I knew
active:  we should find a ventilator
active:  we came to Stoke Moran
noverb:  My dear Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I did
active:  You remember in her statement
active:  she said
active:  her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  of course
active:  suggested at once
active:  there must be a communication
noverb:  between the two rooms
noverb:  It could only be a small one
passive: it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
active:  I deduced a ventilator
noverb:  harm can there be in that
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
passive: A ventilator is made
passive: a cord is hung
noverb:  a lady
noverb:  sleeps in the bed dies
active:  Does not
active:  strike you
active:  I cannot as yet see any connection
active:  Did you observe anything very peculiar
noverb:  about
noverb:  bed
noverb:  No
passive: It was clamped to the floor
active:  Did you
noverb:  see a bed fastened like
noverb:  before
active:  I cannot say
active:  I have
noverb:  The lady could not move her bed
active:  It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator
noverb:  to the rope
active:  we may call it
passive: it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  I seem
active:  to see dimly
active:  you are hinting at
active:  We are only just in time
active:  to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
noverb:  Subtle enough and horrible enough
active:  When a doctor does go wrong
active:  he is the first of criminals
active:  He has nerve
active:  he has knowledge
noverb:  Palmer
active:  Pritchard were among the heads of their profession
noverb:  This man strikes even deeper
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall be able
active:  to strike deeper still
active:  we shall have horrors enough
active:  the night is over
noverb:  for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe
noverb:  turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
noverb:  About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
noverb:  all was dark in the direction of the Manor House
active:  Two hours passed slowly away
noverb:  suddenly
noverb:  just at the stroke of eleven
active:  a single bright light shone out right in front of us
active:  That is our signal
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  springing to his feet
active:  it comes from the middle window
active:  we passed out
active:  he exchanged a few words with the landlord
active:  explaining
active:  we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that we might spend the night there
noverb:  A moment later
active:  we were out on the dark road
noverb:  a chill wind blowing in our faces
noverb:  one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom
active:  to guide us on our sombre errand
active:  There was little difficulty
active:  entering the grounds
noverb:  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
noverb:  Making our way among the trees
active:  we reached the lawn
active:  crossed it
active:  were about
active:  to enter through the window
noverb:  out from a clump of laurel bushes there
novoice: darted
novoice: seemed
active:  to be a hideous
noverb:  distorted child
active:  threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs
active:  ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
noverb:  My God
active:  I whispered
active:  did you see it
active:  Holmes was for the moment
active:  I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
active:  he broke into a low laugh
novoice: put his lips to my ear
active:  It is a nice household
active:  he murmured
active:  That is the baboon
active:  I had forgotten the strange pets
active:  the doctor affected
active:  There was a cheetah
noverb:  too
active:  perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
active:  I confess
active:  I felt easier in my mind
noverb:  after following Holmes' example
active:  slipping off my shoes
active:  I found myself inside the bedroom
active:  My companion noiselessly closed the shutters
active:  moved the lamp onto the table
noverb:  cast his eyes round the room
noverb:  All was
active:  we had seen it in the daytime
active:  creeping up to me
active:  making a trumpet of his hand
active:  he whispered into my ear again
noverb:  gently
active:  it was all
noverb:  that I could do to distinguish the words
active:  The least sound would be fatal to our plans
active:  I nodded to show
active:  I had heard
active:  We must sit without light
active:  He would see it through the ventilator
active:  I nodded again
active:  Do not go asleep
active:  your very life may depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  Have your pistol
active:  ready in case
active:  we should need it
active:  I will sit on the side of the bed
noverb:  you in
noverb:  chair
active:  I took out my revolver
active:  laid it on the corner of the table
active:  Holmes had brought up a long thin cane
noverb:  this
active:  he placed upon the bed beside him
active:  By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
active:  he turned down the lamp
passive: we were left in darkness
active:  shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil
active:  I could not hear a sound
noverb:  not even the drawing of a breath
active:  I knew
noverb:  my companion sat open-eyed
noverb:  within a few feet of me
noverb:  in the same state of nervous tension in
active:  I was myself
active:  The shutters cut off the least ray of light
active:  we waited in absolute darkness
noverb:  From
active:  came the occasional cry of a night-bird
noverb:  once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
active:  told us
active:  the cheetah was indeed at liberty
noverb:  Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock
active:  boomed out every quarter of an hour
noverb:  long they seemed
noverb:  those quarters
active:  Twelve struck
noverb:  one
noverb:  two
noverb:  three
active:  still we sat waiting silently for
active:  might befall
noverb:  Suddenly
active:  there was the momentary gleam
noverb:  of a light up in the direction of the ventilator
passive: vanished immediately
passive: was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil
noverb:  heated metal
active:  Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern
active:  I heard a gentle sound of movement
noverb:  all was silent once
active:  the smell grew stronger
noverb:  For half an hour
active:  I sat with straining ears
active:  suddenly another sound became audible
noverb:  a very gentle
noverb:  soothing sound
noverb:  like
active:  of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
noverb:  The instant
active:  we heard it
active:  Holmes sprang from the bed
active:  struck a match
novoice: lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
active:  You see it, Watson
active:  he yelled
active:  You see it
active:  I saw nothing
active:  At the moment when Holmes struck the light
active:  I heard a low
noverb:  clear whistle
active:  the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me
active:  to tell
active:  it was at
novoice: my friend lashed
noverb:  savagely
active:  I could
noverb:  however
noverb:  see
active:  his face was deadly pale
novoice: filled with horror and loathing
active:  He had ceased
active:  to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator
active:  suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to
active:  I have ever listened
active:  It swelled up louder
noverb:  louder
noverb:  a hoarse yell of pain
noverb:  fear
noverb:  anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
active:  They say
noverb:  away down in the village
noverb:  even in the distant parsonage
active:  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
active:  It struck cold to our hearts
active:  I stood
active:  gazing at Holmes
noverb:  he at me
active:  until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from
active:  it rose
active:  can it mean
active:  I gasped
active:  It means
active:  it is all
noverb:  over
active:  Holmes answered
active:  And perhaps, after all, it is for the best
noverb:  Take your pistol
active:  we will enter Dr. Roylott's room
active:  With a grave face he lit the lamp
active:  led the way down the corridor
active:  Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
active:  he turned the handle
active:  entered
noverb:  I at his heels
noverb:  with the cocked pistol in my hand
active:  It was a singular sight
active:  met our eyes
active:  On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open
active:  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe
noverb:  the door of
active:  was ajar
active:  Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  clad in a long grey dressing-gown
active:  his bare ankles protruding beneath
active:  his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers
active:  Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash
active:  we had noticed during the day
passive: His chin was cocked upward
passive: his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
noverb:  Round his brow
active:  he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles,
active:  seemed to be bound tightly round his head
active:  we entered
active:  he made
noverb:  sound
noverb:  motion
noverb:  The band! the speckled band
noverb:  whispered Holmes
active:  I took a step forward
active:  In an instant his strange headgear began
active:  to move
active:  there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head
noverb:  puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
active:  It is a swamp adder
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  the deadliest snake in India
active:  He has died within ten seconds
passive: being bitten
active:  Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent
noverb:  the schemer falls into the pit
active:  he digs for another
noverb:  Let us thrust this creature back into its den
active:  we can
noverb:  remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter
noverb:  let the county police know
active:  has happened
active:  he spoke
active:  he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
noverb:  throwing the noose round the reptile's neck
active:  he drew it from its horrid perch
active:  carrying it at arm's length
active:  threw it into the iron safe
active:  he closed upon
noverb:  it
active:  Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  of Stoke Moran
active:  It is not necessary
noverb:  that I should prolong a narrative
active:  has already run to too great a length
active:  telling
active:  we broke the sad news to the terrified girl
active:  we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow
noverb:  of
active:  the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
novoice: the doctor met his fate
active:  indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
noverb:  The little
active:  I had yet
active:  to learn
active:  of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
active:  I had
active:  said he
active:  come to an entirely erroneous conclusion
noverb:  shows
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  dangerous it always is
active:  to reason from insufficient data
noverb:  The presence of the gipsies
noverb:  the use of the word 'band
passive: was used by the poor girl, no doubt,
active:  to explain the appearance
active:  she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match
active:  were sufficient
active:  to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
active:  I can only claim the merit
noverb:  I
active:  reconsidered my position
noverb:  however
active:  it became clear to me
active:  danger threatened an occupant of the room
active:  could not come
noverb:  from the window or the door
passive: My attention was speedily drawn
active:  I have already remarked to
noverb:  you, to this ventilator,
noverb:  to the bell-rope
active:  hung down to the bed
noverb:  The discovery
active:  this was a dummy
passive: the bed was clamped to the floor
active:  gave rise to the suspicion
active:  the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole
noverb:  coming to the bed
noverb:  The idea of a snake
novoice: occurred to me
active:  I coupled it with my knowledge
passive: the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India
active:  I felt
active:  I was probably on the right track
noverb:  The idea
active:  using a form of poison
passive: could not possibly be discovered
active:  by any chemical test was just such a one
active:  would occur to a clever and ruthless man
active:  had had an Eastern training
noverb:  The rapidity with
active:  such a poison would take effect
noverb:  would also, from his point of view, be an advantage
active:  It would be a sharp-eyed coroner
noverb:  indeed
active:  could distinguish the two little dark punctures
active:  would show
active:  the poison fangs had done their work
noverb:  Then I thought of the whistle
noverb:  Of course he must recall the snake
active:  the morning light revealed it to the victim
active:  He had trained it
noverb:  probably by the use of the milk
active:  we saw
active:  to return to him
novoice: summoned
active:  He would put it through this ventilator at the hour
active:  he thought best
noverb:  with the certainty
active:  it would crawl down the rope
noverb:  land on the bed
active:  It might or might not bite the occupant
active:  perhaps she might escape every night for a week
noverb:  sooner
noverb:  later she must fall a victim
active:  I had come to these conclusions
active:  I had entered his room
active:  An inspection of his chair showed me
active:  he had been in the habit
active:  standing on
noverb:  it
noverb:  of course would be necessary in order
active:  he should reach the ventilator
noverb:  The sight of the safe
noverb:  the saucer of milk
active:  the loop of whipcord were enough
active:  to finally dispel any doubts
active:  may have remained
active:  The metallic clang heard
passive: by Miss Stoner was obviously caused
active:  by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
active:  Having once made up my mind
active:  you know the steps
active:  I took in order
active:  to put the matter to the proof
active:  I heard the creature hiss
active:  I have no doubt
active:  you did also
noverb:  I
active:  lit the light
active:  attacked it
noverb:  With the result
active:  driving it through the ventilator
noverb:  And also with the result
active:  causing it
active:  to turn upon its master at the other side
active:  Some of the blows of my cane came home
active:  roused its snakish temper
active:  it flew upon the first person
active:  it saw
noverb:  In this way
active:  I am no doubt
noverb:  indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death
active:  I cannot say
active:  it is likely
active:  to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
noverb:  IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
noverb:  Of all the problems
passive: have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy
active:  there were only two
noverb:  which I was the means
noverb:  of introducing to his notice
noverb:  of Mr. Hatherley's thumb
noverb:  of Colonel Warburton's madness
active:  Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer
active:  the other was so strange in its inception
noverb:  so dramatic in its details
active:  it may be the
noverb:  more worthy
passive: being placed upon record
noverb:  even
noverb:  it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods
active:  reasoning by
active:  he achieved such remarkable results
active:  The story has
active:  I believe
passive: been told more than once in the newspapers
active:  , like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking
noverb:  set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print
active:  the facts slowly evolve
noverb:  your own eyes
noverb:  the mystery clears gradually away
active:  each new discovery furnishes a step
active:  leads on to the complete truth
active:  At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me
active:  the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
active:  It was in the summer of '89
active:  not long after my marriage
active:  the events occurred
active:  I am now about
active:  to summarise
active:  I had returned to civil practice
active:  had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
active:  I continually visited him
active:  occasionally even persuaded him
active:  to forgo his Bohemian habits
active:  to come and visit us
active:  My practice had steadily increased
active:  I happened
active:  to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station
active:  I got a few patients from among the officials
noverb:  One of these
active:  I had cured of a painful
noverb:  lingering disease
active:  was never weary
active:  advertising my virtues
active:  endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over
active:  he might have any influence
noverb:  One morning
noverb:  at a little
noverb:  seven o'clock
passive: I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door
active:  to announce
active:  two men had come from Paddington
active:  were waiting in the consulting-room
active:  I dressed hurriedly
noverb:  for I knew by experience
active:  railway cases were seldom trivial
novoice: hastened downstairs
active:  As I descended
noverb:  my old ally
noverb:  the guard
active:  came out of the room
active:  closed the door tightly behind him
noverb:  I've got him here
active:  he whispered
active:  jerking his thumb over his shoulder
active:  he's all right
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  for his manner suggested
active:  it was some strange creature
noverb:  which he had caged up in my room
active:  It's a new patient
active:  he whispered
active:  I thought
noverb:  I'd bring him round myself
noverb:  he couldn't slip away
noverb:  There
active:  he is
noverb:  all safe
noverb:  sound
active:  I must go now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I have my dooties
noverb:  just the same as you
noverb:  And off he went
noverb:  this trusty tout
noverb:  without even giving me time
active:  to thank him
active:  I entered my consulting-room
novoice: found
active:  a gentleman seated by the table
passive: He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
active:  he had laid down upon my books
active:  Round one of his hands
noverb:  he had a handkerchief wrapped
passive: was mottled all over with bloodstains
active:  He was young
noverb:  , not more than five-and-twenty
active:  I should say
noverb:  with a strong, masculine face
active:  he was exceedingly pale
noverb:  and gave me the impression of a man
active:  was suffering from some strong agitation
active:  it took all his strength of mind
active:  to control
active:  I am sorry
active:  to knock you up
noverb:  early
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said he
active:  I have had a very serious accident during the night
active:  I came in by train this morning
active:  inquiring at Paddington as to
active:  I might find a doctor
noverb:  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
noverb:  I gave the maid a card
active:  I see
active:  she has left it upon the side-table
active:  I took it up
active:  glanced at
noverb:  it
noverb:  Mr. Victor Hatherley
noverb:  hydraulic engineer
noverb:  16A
noverb:  Victoria Street (3rd floor)
active:  That was the name, style
noverb:  abode of my morning visitor
active:  I regret
noverb:  I have kept you waiting
active:  said I
active:  sitting down in my library-chair
active:  You are fresh
noverb:  from a night journey
active:  I understand
active:  is in itself a monotonous occupation
noverb:  Oh
active:  my night could not be called monotonous
active:  said he
novoice: laughed
active:  He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair
active:  shaking his sides
active:  All my medical instincts rose up against
noverb:  laugh
noverb:  Stop it
active:  I cried
active:  pull yourself together
active:  and I poured out some water from a caraffe
active:  It was useless
noverb:  , however
active:  He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts
active:  come upon a strong nature
active:  some great crisis is over
noverb:  gone
active:  Presently he came to himself once
noverb:  very weary
noverb:  pale-looking
active:  I have been making a fool of myself
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Not at all
active:  Drink this
active:  I dashed some brandy into the water
active:  the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
active:  That's better
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb
noverb:  rather to the place
passive: my thumb used
active:  to be
active:  He unwound the handkerchief
active:  held out his hand
noverb:  It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder
active:  to look at it
active:  There were four protruding fingers
noverb:  a horrid red, spongy surface
active:  the thumb should
passive: have been
passive: It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  this is a terrible injury
active:  It must have bled considerably
noverb:  Yes
active:  it did
active:  I fainted
passive: it was done
active:  I think
active:  I must have been senseless for a long time
active:  When I came to
noverb:  I found
active:  it was still bleeding
active:  I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist
active:  braced it up with a twig
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You should have been a surgeon
active:  It is a question of hydraulics
noverb:  you see
active:  came within my own province
passive: This has been done
active:  said I
active:  examining the wound
noverb:  by a very heavy and sharp instrument
noverb:  A thing
noverb:  a cleaver
active:  said he
noverb:  An accident
active:  I presume
noverb:  By no means
noverb:  ! a murderous attack
noverb:  Very murderous indeed
active:  You horrify me
active:  I sponged the wound
active:  cleaned it
active:  dressed it
active:  finally covered it over with cotton wadding
noverb:  carbolised bandages
active:  He lay back
active:  wincing
active:  he bit his lip from time to time
active:  is that
active:  I asked
active:  I had finished
noverb:  Capital
active:  Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man
active:  I was very weak
active:  I have had a good deal
active:  to go through
active:  Perhaps you had better not
active:  speak of the matter
active:  It is evidently trying to your nerves
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  not now
active:  I shall have to tell my tale to the police
noverb:  between ourselves
active:  it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine
passive: I should be surprised
active:  they believed my statement
noverb:  for it is a very extraordinary one
active:  I have not much in the way of proof with
active:  to back it up
noverb:  and,
noverb:  even
active:  they believe me
noverb:  the clues
active:  I can give
active:  them are so vague
noverb:  that it is a question
noverb:  whether justice will be done
noverb:  Ha
active:  cried I
active:  it is anything
noverb:  in the nature of a problem
noverb:  you desire
active:  to see solved
active:  I should strongly recommend you
active:  to come to my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  you go to the official police
noverb:  Oh
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  fellow
active:  answered my visitor
active:  and I should be very glad
active:  he would take the matter up
noverb:  of course I must use the official police as well
noverb:  Would you give me an introduction to him
active:  I'll do better
noverb:  I'll take you round to him myself
passive: I should be immensely obliged to
noverb:  you
active:  We'll call a cab
active:  go together
active:  We shall just be in time
active:  to have a little breakfast with him
active:  Do you feel equal to it
noverb:  Yes
active:  I shall not feel easy
active:  I have told my story
active:  my servant will call a cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in an instant
active:  I rushed upstairs
active:  explained the matter shortly to my wife
active:  in five minutes was inside a hansom
noverb:  driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes was
noverb:  as I expected
noverb:  lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown
active:  reading the agony column of The Times
active:  smoking his before-breakfast pipe
passive: was composed
novoice: of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before
noverb:  all carefully dried
novoice: collected on the corner of the mantelpiece
active:  He received us in his quietly genial fashion
active:  ordered fresh rashers
noverb:  eggs
active:  joined us in a hearty meal
passive: When it was concluded
active:  he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa
active:  placed a pillow beneath his head
active:  laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
active:  It is easy
active:  to see
noverb:  your experience has been no common one
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said he
active:  Pray
active:  lie down there
active:  make yourself absolutely at home
active:  Tell us
active:  you can
noverb:  stop
passive: you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
active:  Thank you
active:  said my patient
active:  I have felt another man
active:  the doctor bandaged me
active:  I think
active:  your breakfast has completed the cure
active:  I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible
active:  I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
active:  Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
active:  veiled his keen and eager nature
active:  I sat opposite to him
active:  we listened in silence to the strange story
active:  our visitor detailed to us
active:  You must know
active:  said he
active:  I am an orphan and a bachelor
active:  residing alone in lodgings in London
noverb:  By profession
active:  I am a hydraulic engineer
active:  I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years
passive: I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich
noverb:  Two years ago
active:  having served my time
active:  having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death
active:  I determined
active:  to start in business for myself
active:  took professional chambers in Victoria Street
active:  I suppose
active:  everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
active:  To me it has been exceptionally
active:  During two years I have had three consultations
noverb:  one small job
active:  is absolutely all
active:  my profession has brought me
active:  My gross takings amount to $27 10s
noverb:  Every day
noverb:  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon
active:  I waited in my little den
noverb:  until at last my heart began
active:  to sink
active:  I came to believe
active:  I should never have any practice at all
noverb:  Yesterday,
noverb:  however
noverb:  just
active:  I was thinking
active:  leaving the office
novoice: my clerk entered
active:  to say
active:  there was a gentleman
active:  waiting
active:  wished to see me upon business
active:  He brought up a card
noverb:  too
noverb:  with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Close at his heels came the colonel himself
noverb:  a man rather over the middle size
noverb:  of an exceeding thinness
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  thin a man
noverb:  His whole face sharpened away into nose
noverb:  chin
active:  the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
active:  Yet this emaciation seemed
noverb:  to be his natural habit
noverb:  due to no disease
active:  for his eye was bright
noverb:  his step brisk
noverb:  his bearing assured
active:  He was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed
noverb:  his age
active:  I should judge
active:  would be nearer forty
noverb:  thirty
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  with something of a German accent
passive: You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,
active:  being a man
noverb:  who is not only proficient
noverb:  in his profession
active:  is also discreet and capable
active:  preserving a secret
active:  I bowed
noverb:  feeling
active:  any young man would at such an address
active:  May I ask
active:  it was
active:  gave me
noverb:  good a character
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it is better
noverb:  that I should not tell you
noverb:  just at this moment
active:  I have it from the same source
active:  you are
noverb:  an orphan
noverb:  a bachelor
active:  are residing alone in London
active:  That is quite correct
active:  I answered
active:  you will excuse me
active:  I say
active:  I cannot see
noverb:  all this bears upon my professional qualifications
active:  I understand
active:  it was on a professional matter
active:  you wished
active:  to speak to me
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  you will find
noverb:  all I say
active:  is really to the point
active:  I have a professional commission for you
active:  absolute secrecy is quite essential
noverb:  absolute secrecy
active:  you understand
noverb:  of course we may expect
noverb:  from a man
active:  is alone
noverb:  from one
noverb:  lives in the bosom of his family
active:  I promise to keep a secret
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you may absolutely depend upon my doing
active:  He looked very hard at me as I spoke
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  I had never seen so suspicious
active:  questioning an eye
noverb:  Do you promise
active:  said
noverb:  he at last
noverb:  Yes
active:  I promise
noverb:  Absolute
noverb:  complete silence before
noverb:  during
noverb:  after
noverb:  No reference to the matter at all
noverb:  in word or writing
noverb:  I have already given you my word
noverb:  Very good
active:  He suddenly sprang up
noverb:  darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door
noverb:  The passage
active:  was empty
active:  That's all right
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  coming back
active:  I know
active:  clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs
active:  Now we can talk in safety
active:  He drew up his chair very close
noverb:  to mine
active:  began
active:  to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
noverb:  A feeling of repulsion
noverb:  of something akin
active:  to fear
active:  had begun
active:  to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
noverb:  Even my dread
active:  losing a client
active:  could not restrain me
active:  showing my impatience
active:  I beg
active:  you will state your business, sir,
active:  said I
active:  my time is of value
active:  Heaven forgive me for that last sentence
active:  the words came to my lips
noverb:  would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you
active:  he asked
noverb:  Most admirably
active:  I say a night's work
noverb:  an hour's would be nearer the mark
active:  I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine
active:  has got out of gear
active:  you show us
active:  is wrong
active:  we shall soon set
active:  it right ourselves
noverb:  do you think of such a commission as that
active:  The work appears to be light
noverb:  the pay munificent
noverb:  Precisely
active:  We shall want you
active:  to come to-night by the last train
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  To Eyford
noverb:  in Berkshire
active:  It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire
noverb:  within seven miles of Reading
active:  There is a train
noverb:  from Paddington
noverb:  would bring you there at about 11
noverb:  15
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall come down in a carriage
active:  to meet you
active:  There is a drive
noverb:  Yes
active:  our little place is quite out in the country
noverb:  It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
active:  we can hardly get there
noverb:  midnight
active:  I suppose
active:  there would be no chance of a train back
passive: I should be compelled
active:  to stop the night
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  we could easily give you a shake-down
active:  That is very awkward
active:  Could I not come at some more convenient hour
active:  We have judged it best
active:  you should come late
active:  It is to recompense you for any inconvenience
active:  we are paying to
noverb:  you
noverb:  a young and unknown man
noverb:  a fee
active:  would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  you would like
active:  to draw out of the business
active:  there is plenty of time
active:  to do
active:  I thought of the fifty guineas
noverb:  of
noverb:  very useful they would be to me
noverb:  Not at all
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I shall be very happy
active:  to accommodate myself to your wishes
active:  I should like
noverb:  however
active:  to understand a little more clearly
active:  it is
active:  you wish me
active:  to do
noverb:  Quite
active:  It is very natural
noverb:  that the pledge of secrecy
active:  we have exacted from
active:  you should have aroused your curiosity
active:  I have no wish
active:  to commit you to anything without your having it all laid
noverb:  you
active:  I suppose
active:  we are absolutely safe
noverb:  from eavesdroppers
noverb:  Entirely
noverb:  the matter stands
active:  You are probably aware
noverb:  that fuller's-earth is a valuable product
passive: it is only found in one or two places in England
active:  I have heard
noverb:  Some little time ago
active:  I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading
active:  I was fortunate enough
active:  to discover
active:  there was a deposit
noverb:  of fuller's-earth in one of my fields
active:  examining it
noverb:  however
active:  I found
active:  this deposit was a comparatively small one
noverb:  it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
noverb:  left
noverb:  of them
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the grounds of my neighbours
active:  These good people were absolutely ignorant
active:  their land contained
active:  was quite
noverb:  a gold-mine
noverb:  Naturally,
active:  it was to my interest
active:  to buy their land
active:  they discovered its true value
active:  unfortunately I had no capital by
active:  I could do this
active:  I took a few of my friends into the secret
noverb:  however
active:  they suggested
active:  we should quietly
noverb:  secretly work our own little deposit
noverb:  in this way
active:  we should earn the money
active:  would enable us
active:  to buy the neighbouring fields
noverb:  This
active:  we have
active:  now been doing for some time
noverb:  in order
active:  to help us in our operations
active:  we erected a hydraulic press
noverb:  This press
active:  I have already explained
active:  has got out of order
active:  we wish your advice upon the subject
active:  We guard our secret very jealously
noverb:  however
active:  it once became known
active:  we had hydraulic engineers
active:  coming to our little house
active:  it would soon rouse inquiry
active:  the facts came out
active:  it would be good-bye
noverb:  to any chance
active:  getting these fields
active:  carrying out our plans
active:  That is
active:  I have made
active:  you promise me
active:  you will not tell a human being
active:  you are going to Eyford to-night
active:  I hope
active:  I make it all plain
noverb:  I quite follow you
active:  said I. 'The only point
active:  I could not quite understand
active:  was
active:  use
active:  you could make of a hydraulic press
active:  excavating fuller's-earth
active:  I understand
passive: is dug out
noverb:  gravel from a pit
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he carelessly
active:  we have our own process
active:  We compress the earth into bricks
active:  to remove them
active:  revealing
active:  they are
active:  is a mere detail
active:  I have taken you fully into my confidence now
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  I have shown you
active:  I trust you
active:  He rose as
active:  he spoke
active:  I shall expect you
noverb:  at Eyford at 11
noverb:  15
active:  I shall certainly be there
noverb:  And not a word to a soul
active:  He looked at me with a last long
noverb:  questioning gaze
active:  pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp
active:  he hurried from the room
noverb:  Well,
active:  I came to think it all over in cool blood
active:  I was very much astonished
noverb:  as you may
noverb:  think
noverb:  at this sudden commission
passive: had been intrusted to me
noverb:  On the one hand, of course,
active:  I was glad
noverb:  , for the fee was at least tenfold
active:  I should have asked
passive: had
active:  I set a price upon my own services
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that this order might lead to other ones
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me
active:  I could not think
noverb:  his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient
active:  to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight
noverb:  his extreme anxiety
active:  I should tell anyone of my errand
noverb:  However,
active:  I threw all fears to the winds
active:  ate a hearty supper
active:  drove to Paddington
novoice: started off
active:  having obeyed to the letter the injunction as
active:  to holding my tongue
active:  At Reading I had to change not only my carriage
noverb:  my station
noverb:  However,
active:  I was in time for the last train to Eyford
active:  I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock
active:  I was the only passenger
noverb:  who got out there
active:  there was no one
noverb:  upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
novoice: As I passed out through the wicket gate
noverb:  however
active:  I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
active:  Without a word he grasped my arm
active:  hurried me into a carriage
noverb:  the door of
active:  was standing open
active:  He drew up the windows on
noverb:  side
passive: tapped on the wood-work
noverb:  away we went
active:  the horse could go
noverb:  One horse
active:  interjected Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only one
active:  Did you observe the colour
noverb:  Yes
active:  I saw it by the side-lights
active:  I was stepping into the carriage
active:  It was a chestnut
noverb:  Tired-looking
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  glossy
active:  Thank you
active:  I am sorry
active:  to have interrupted you
active:  Pray
active:  continue your most interesting statement
noverb:  Away we went
active:  we drove for at least an hour
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark had said
active:  it was only seven miles
active:  I should think
noverb:  from the rate
active:  we seemed to go
noverb:  from the time
active:  we took
active:  it must have been nearer twelve
active:  He sat at my side in silence all the time
active:  I was aware
noverb:  , more than once
active:  I glanced in his direction
active:  he was looking at me with great intensity
active:  The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world
noverb:  for we lurched and jolted terribly
active:  I tried
active:  to look out of the windows
active:  to see something of
active:  we were
passive: they were made of frosted glass
noverb:  I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
noverb:  Now
active:  I hazarded some remark
active:  to break the monotony of the journey
novoice: the colonel answered only in monosyllables
active:  the conversation soon flagged
noverb:  At last
noverb:  however
passive: the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
active:  the carriage came to a stand
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out
active:  I followed after him
active:  pulled me swiftly into a porch
active:  gaped in front of us
active:  We stepped
active:  it were
noverb:  right out of the carriage
noverb:  into the hall
active:  I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
noverb:  The instant
active:  I had crossed the threshold
novoice: the door slammed heavily behind us
active:  I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels
active:  the carriage drove away
active:  It was pitch dark inside the house
novoice: the colonel fumbled
active:  looking for matches
active:  muttering under his breath
active:  Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage
active:  a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction
active:  It grew broader
novoice: a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand
active:  she held above her head
active:  pushing her face forward
active:  peering at us
active:  I could see
active:  she was pretty
noverb:  ,
noverb:  from the gloss with
active:  the light shone upon her dark dress I knew
active:  it was a rich material
active:  She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
active:  asking a question
novoice: my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable
active:  she gave such a start
active:  the lamp nearly fell from her hand
active:  Colonel Stark went up to her
noverb:  whispered something in her ear
active:  pushing her back into the room from whence she had come
active:  he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
active:  Perhaps you will have the kindness
active:  to wait in this room for a few minutes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  throwing open another door
active:  It was a quiet
noverb:  little
noverb:  plainly furnished room
noverb:  with a round table in the centre
noverb:  on
passive: several German books were scattered
active:  Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door
noverb:  I shall not keep you waiting an instant
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: vanished into the darkness
active:  I glanced at the books upon the table
active:  in spite of my ignorance of German I could see
active:  two of them were treatises
noverb:  on science
active:  the others being volumes of poetry
novoice: Then I walked across to the window
active:  hoping
active:  I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
noverb:  an oak shutter
noverb:  heavily barred
active:  was folded across
noverb:  it
active:  It was a
noverb:  wonderfully silent house
active:  There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage
active:  everything was deadly still
active:  A vague feeling of uneasiness began
active:  to steal over me
active:  were these German people
active:  were they doing living in this strange
noverb:  out-of-the-way place
active:  And where was the place
active:  I was ten miles
noverb:  from Eyford
active:  that was all I knew
noverb:  north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west I had no idea
noverb:  For
noverb:  matter
noverb:  Reading
noverb:  possibly other large towns
active:  were within that radius
active:  the place might not be so secluded
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Yet
active:  it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
noverb:  that we were in the country
active:  I paced up and down the room
active:  humming a tune under my breath
active:  to keep up my spirits
noverb:  feeling
active:  I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness
active:  the door of my room swung slowly open
active:  The woman was standing in the aperture
noverb:  the darkness of the hall behind her
noverb:  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face
active:  I could see at a glance
active:  she was sick
noverb:  with fear
active:  the sight sent a chill to my own heart
active:  She held up one shaking finger
active:  to warn me
active:  to be silent
active:  she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me
active:  her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her
active:  I would go
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  trying hard
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  to speak calmly
active:  I would go
active:  I should not stay here
active:  There is no good for you
active:  to do
noverb:  madam
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I have not yet done
active:  I came for
active:  I cannot possibly leave
active:  I have seen the machine
active:  It is not worth
noverb:  your
active:  to wait
active:  she went on
active:  You can pass through the door
active:  no one hinders
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  I smiled and shook my head
active:  she suddenly threw aside her constraint
active:  made a step forward
noverb:  , with her hands wrung together
noverb:  For the love of Heaven
active:  she whispered
active:  get away from here
active:  it is too late
active:  I am somewhat headstrong
noverb:  by nature
noverb:  the
active:  ready to engage in an affair
active:  there is some obstacle
noverb:  in the way
active:  I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,
noverb:  of the unpleasant night
active:  seemed to be
noverb:  me
active:  Was it all
active:  to go for nothing
active:  should I slink away
active:  having carried out my commission
noverb:  without the payment
active:  was my due
active:  This woman might
noverb:  for all I knew
active:  be a monomaniac
noverb:  With a stout bearing
noverb:  therefore
active:  her manner had shaken me more than
active:  I cared to confess
noverb:  I still shook my head
active:  declared my intention
active:  remaining
active:  I was
active:  She was about
active:  to renew her entreaties
active:  a door slammed overhead
passive: the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
active:  She listened for an instant
active:  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture
noverb:  vanished as suddenly
active:  she had come
active:  The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark
noverb:  a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin
passive: was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson
active:  This is my secretary
noverb:  manager
active:  said
noverb:  the colonel
noverb:  By the way
active:  I was under the impression
active:  I left this door shut just now
active:  I fear
active:  you have felt the draught
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  I opened the door myself
active:  I felt the room
active:  to be a little close
active:  He shot one of his suspicious looks at me
noverb:  Perhaps we
active:  had better
active:  proceed to business
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Mr. Ferguson
active:  I will take you up
active:  to see the machine
noverb:  I had better put my hat on
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
active:  it is in the house
active:  you dig fuller's-earth in the house
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  This is only
active:  we compress it
active:  never mind that
noverb:  All we wish you
active:  to do
active:  is to examine the machine
noverb:  to let us know
active:  is wrong with it
active:  We went upstairs together
noverb:  the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him
active:  It was a labyrinth of an old house
noverb:  , with corridors
noverb:  passages
active:  narrow winding staircases
noverb:  little low doors
noverb:  the thresholds of
passive: were hollowed out by the generations
active:  had crossed them
active:  There were no carpets
noverb:  no signs of any furniture above the ground floor
active:  the plaster was peeling off the walls
active:  the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches
active:  I tried
active:  to put on as unconcerned an air as possible
active:  I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady
active:  I disregarded them
active:  I kept a keen eye upon my two companions
active:  Ferguson appeared
active:  to be a morose and silent man
active:  I could see from the little
active:  he said
active:  he was at least a
noverb:  fellow-countryman
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last
noverb:  a low door
active:  he unlocked
active:  was a small
noverb:  square room
noverb:  in
active:  the three of us could hardly get at one time
active:  Ferguson remained
active:  the colonel ushered me in
active:  We are now
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  actually within the hydraulic press
active:  it would be a
noverb:  particularly unpleasant thing for us
active:  anyone were to turn it on
active:  The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston
active:  it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
active:  There are small lateral columns of water
active:  receive the force
active:  transmit and multiply it in the manner
active:  is familiar to you
active:  The machine goes readily enough
active:  there is some stiffness
noverb:  in the working of it
active:  it has lost a little of its force
active:  Perhaps you will have the goodness
active:  to look it
active:  show us
noverb:  we can set it right
active:  I took the lamp from him
active:  I examined the machine very thoroughly
noverb:  It was indeed a gigantic one
noverb:  capable
active:  exercising enormous pressure
active:  When I passed
noverb:  however
novoice: pressed down the levers
active:  controlled it
active:  I knew at once by the whishing sound
active:  there was a slight leakage
active:  allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders
active:  An examination showed
noverb:  one of the india-rubber bands
active:  was round the head of a driving-rod
active:  had shrunk
noverb:  not quite
active:  to fill the socket along
novoice: it worked
active:  This was clearly the cause of the loss of power
active:  I pointed it out to my companions
active:  followed my remarks very carefully
active:  asked several practical questions as to
noverb:  they should proceed to set it right
active:  When I had made it clear to them
noverb:  , I returned to the main chamber of the machine
active:  took a good look at it
active:  to satisfy my own curiosity
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  at a glance
noverb:  the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication
active:  for it would be absurd
active:  to suppose
noverb:  powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
active:  The walls were of wood
novoice: the floor consisted of a large iron trough
active:  I came to examine it
active:  I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
active:  I had stooped and was scraping at this
active:  to see exactly
active:  it was
active:  I heard a muttered exclamation in German
active:  saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
active:  are you doing there
active:  he asked
active:  I felt angry
passive: having been tricked by
active:  elaborate a story as
active:  he had told me
active:  I was admiring your fuller's-earth
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I think
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you as to your machine
active:  I knew
active:  the exact purpose was for
passive: it was used
noverb:  The instant
active:  I uttered the words
active:  I regretted the rashness of my speech
noverb:  His face set hard
active:  a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
noverb:  Very well
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you shall know all about the machine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  slammed the little door
active:  turned the key in the lock
active:  I rushed towards
noverb:  it
novoice: pulled at the handle
active:  it was quite secure
noverb:  ,
active:  did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves
noverb:  Hullo
active:  I yelled
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Colonel
active:  Let me out
noverb:  And then suddenly in the silence
active:  I heard a sound
active:  sent my heart into my mouth
active:  It was the clank of the levers and the swish
noverb:  of the leaking cylinder
active:  He had set the engine at work
active:  The lamp still stood upon the floor
active:  I had placed it
active:  examining the trough
active:  By its light I saw
active:  the black ceiling was coming down upon me
noverb:  slowly
noverb:  jerkily
active:  none knew better
noverb:  myself
noverb:  with a force
active:  must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
active:  I threw myself
active:  screaming, against the door,
novoice: dragged with my nails at the lock
active:  I implored the colonel
active:  to let me out
active:  the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries
active:  The ceiling was only a foot
noverb:  two above my head
passive: with my hand upraised
active:  I could feel its hard
noverb:  rough surface
active:  it flashed through my mind
active:  the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in
active:  I met it
active:  If I lay on my face the weight
active:  would come upon my spine
active:  I shuddered
active:  to think of
noverb:  dreadful snap
noverb:  Easier the other way
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  and
noverb:  had I the nerve
active:  to lie and look up at
noverb:  deadly black shadow wavering down upon me
active:  Already I was unable
active:  to stand erect
novoice: my eye caught something
active:  brought a gush of hope back to my heart
active:  I have said
noverb:  the floor
active:  ceiling were of iron
active:  the walls were of wood
active:  As I gave a last
active:  hurried glance around
active:  I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards
active:  broadened and broadened
passive: a small panel was pushed backward
active:  For an instant I could hardly believe
active:  here was indeed a door
active:  led away from death
noverb:  The next instant
active:  I threw myself through
noverb:  lay half-fainting upon the other side
active:  The panel had closed again behind me
noverb:  the crash of the lamp
noverb:  a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal
active:  told me
noverb:  narrow had been my escape
passive: I was recalled
active:  to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist
active:  I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor
passive: a woman bent over me
novoice: tugged at me with her left hand
active:  she held a candle in her right
active:  It was the same good friend
noverb:  warning I had
noverb:  foolishly rejected
active:  Come! come
active:  she cried breathlessly
active:  They will be here
noverb:  in a moment
active:  They will see
active:  you are not there
noverb:  Oh
active:  do not waste the so-precious time
active:  come
noverb:  This time
noverb:  at least
noverb:  I did not scorn her advice
active:  I staggered to my feet
active:  ran with her along the corridor
noverb:  down a winding stair
active:  The latter led to another broad passage
noverb:  just
active:  we reached it
active:  we heard the sound of running feet
noverb:  the shouting of two voices
active:  one answering the other from the floor on
active:  we were
noverb:  from the one beneath
noverb:  My guide stopped and looked about her
noverb:  one
active:  is at her wit's end
noverb:  she threw open a door
active:  led into a bedroom
noverb:  through the window of
active:  the moon was shining brightly
active:  It is your only chance
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  It is high
active:  it may be
active:  you can jump it
active:  she spoke a light
active:  sprang into view at the further end of the passage
active:  I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon
noverb:  a butcher's cleaver in the other
active:  I rushed across the bedroom
noverb:  flung open the window
novoice: looked out
noverb:  quiet and sweet
noverb:  wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight
active:  it could not be more than thirty feet down
active:  I clambered out upon the sill
active:  I hesitated
active:  to jump
active:  I should have heard
novoice: passed between my saviour and the ruffian
active:  pursued me
active:  she were ill-used
noverb:  ,
noverb:  at any risks
passive: I was determined
active:  to go back to her assistance
active:  The thought had hardly flashed through my mind
active:  he was at the door
active:  pushing his way past her
active:  she threw her arms
active:  round him
active:  tried
noverb:  to hold him back
noverb:  Fritz
noverb:  Fritz
active:  she cried in English
active:  remember your promise after the last time
active:  You said
active:  it should not be again
active:  He will be silent
noverb:  Oh
active:  he will be silent
active:  You are mad
noverb:  , Elise
active:  he shouted
noverb:  struggling
active:  to break away from her
active:  You will be the ruin of us
active:  He has seen too much
noverb:  Let me pass
active:  I say
active:  He dashed her to one side
noverb:  rushing to the window
noverb:  cut at me with his heavy weapon
noverb:  I had let myself go
active:  was hanging by the hands to the sill
noverb:  his blow fell
active:  I was conscious
noverb:  of a dull pain
noverb:  my grip loosened
active:  I fell into the garden below
passive: I was shaken
novoice: not hurt by the fall
active:  I picked myself up
active:  rushed off among the bushes
active:  I could run
noverb:  for I understood
active:  I was far
noverb:  from being out of danger
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  I ran
noverb:  a deadly dizziness
active:  sickness came over me
active:  I glanced down at my hand
active:  was throbbing painfully
noverb:  for the first time
noverb:  saw
passive: my thumb had been cut off
active:  the blood was pouring from my wound
active:  I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it
active:  there came a sudden
active:  buzzing in my ears
noverb:  next moment
active:  I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
noverb:  long I remained unconscious
active:  I cannot tell
active:  It must have been a very long time
active:  for the moon had sunk
active:  a bright morning was breaking
active:  I came to myself
active:  My clothes were all sodden with dew
noverb:  my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
active:  The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure
active:  I sprang to my feet with the feeling
active:  I might hardly
active:  be safe from my pursuers
noverb:  to my astonishment
active:  I came
active:  to look
active:  round me
noverb:  neither house
active:  garden were to be seen
active:  I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad
noverb:  just a little lower
active:  was a long building
noverb:  proved
noverb:  upon my approaching it
active:  to be the very station at
active:  I had arrived upon the previous night
active:  Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand
noverb:  all
active:  had passed
active:  during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
noverb:  Half dazed
active:  I went into the station
novoice: asked about the morning train
active:  There would be one
noverb:  to Reading in less than an hour
active:  The same porter was on duty
active:  I found
active:  had been there
active:  I arrived
active:  I inquired of him
active:  he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark
active:  The name was strange to him
noverb:  Had he observed a carriage the night
noverb:  waiting for me
noverb:  No
active:  he had not
noverb:  Was there a police-station anywhere near
active:  There was one
noverb:  about three miles off
active:  It was too far for me
active:  to go
noverb:  weak and ill
active:  I was
active:  I determined
active:  to wait
active:  I got back to town
active:  telling my story to the police
noverb:  It was a little past six
active:  I arrived
active:  I went first
noverb:  to have my wound dressed
active:  the doctor was kind enough
active:  to bring me along here
active:  I put the case into your hands
active:  shall do exactly
active:  you advise
noverb:  We
noverb:  sat in silence for some little time
active:  listening to this extraordinary narrative
novoice: Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in
active:  he placed his cuttings
active:  Here is an advertisement
active:  will interest you
active:  said he
active:  It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
active:  Listen to this
noverb:  Lost
noverb:  on the 9th inst
noverb:  Mr. Jeremiah Hayling
passive: aged twenty-six
noverb:  a hydraulic engineer
active:  Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night
passive: has not been heard of
passive: Was dressed in
noverb:  etc
noverb:  etc
noverb:  Ha
active:  That represents the last time
active:  the colonel needed to have his machine
novoice: overhauled
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  cried my patient
active:  explains
active:  the girl said
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  It is quite clear
noverb:  that the colonel was a cool and desperate man
active:  was absolutely determined
active:  nothing should stand in the way of his little game
noverb:  like those out-and-out pirates
active:  will leave no survivor from a captured ship
noverb:  Well,
active:  every moment now is precious
active:  you feel equal to it
active:  we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary
active:  to starting for Eyford
noverb:  Some three hours
noverb:  afterwards
active:  we were all
noverb:  in the train together
noverb:  bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village
noverb:  There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man
noverb:  myself
active:  Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat
active:  was busy with his compasses
active:  drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
noverb:  There
active:  you are
active:  said he
passive: That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
noverb:  The place we want must be somewhere near
noverb:  line
active:  You said ten miles
active:  I think
noverb:  sir
active:  It was an hour's good drive
noverb:  And you think
active:  they brought
active:  you back all
noverb:  way
active:  you were unconscious
active:  They must have done
active:  I have a confused memory
noverb:  too
passive: having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
active:  I cannot understand
active:  said I
active:  is
active:  they should have spared you
active:  they found
active:  you lying
active:  fainting in the garden
passive: Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties
active:  I hardly think
noverb:  likely
active:  I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
noverb:  Oh
active:  we shall soon clear up all that
active:  said Bradstreet
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have drawn my circle
active:  I only wish
active:  I knew at
noverb:  point upon it the folk
active:  we are in search
active:  are to be found
active:  I think
active:  I could lay my finger on it
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  now
active:  cried the inspector
active:  you have formed your opinion
active:  Come
noverb:  now
active:  we shall see
active:  agrees with
noverb:  you
active:  I say
active:  it is south
noverb:  , for the country is more deserted there
active:  And I say east
active:  said my patient
active:  I am for west
active:  remarked the plain-clothes man
noverb:  There are several quiet little villages up there
active:  And I am for north
active:  said I
active:  there are no hills
noverb:  there
active:  our friend says
active:  he did not notice the carriage
active:  go up any
active:  Come
active:  cried the inspector
noverb:  laughing
active:  it's a very pretty diversity of opinion
active:  We have boxed the compass among us
active:  do you give your casting vote to
active:  You are all
active:  wrong
noverb:  we can't all be
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  you can
active:  This is my point
active:  He placed his finger in the centre of the circle
active:  This is
active:  we shall find them
noverb:  the twelve-mile drive
active:  gasped Hatherley
noverb:  Six out
noverb:  six back
noverb:  Nothing simpler
active:  You say yourself
active:  the horse was fresh and glossy
active:  you got in
active:  could it be
active:  it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it is a likely ruse enough
active:  observed Bradstreet thoughtfully
noverb:  Of course
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  as to the nature of this gang
noverb:  None at all
active:  said Holmes
active:  They are coiners
noverb:  on a large scale
active:  have used the machine
active:  to form the amalgam
active:  has taken the place of silver
active:  We have known for some time
active:  a clever gang was at work
active:  said the inspector
active:  They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
active:  We even traced them
noverb:  Reading
active:  could get no farther
noverb:  for they had covered their traces in a way
active:  showed
active:  they were very old hands
noverb:  now
noverb:  thanks to this lucky chance
active:  I think
active:  we have got them right enough
passive: the inspector was mistaken
passive: for those criminals were not destined
active:  to fall into the hands of justice
noverb:  As we rolled into Eyford Station
active:  we saw a gigantic column of smoke
active:  streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood
noverb:  hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
noverb:  A house on fire
active:  asked Bradstreet
active:  the train steamed off again on its way
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  said the station-master
active:  When did it break out
active:  I hear
active:  it was during the night
noverb:  sir
active:  it has got worse
active:  the whole place is in a blaze
active:  house is it
noverb:  Dr. Becher's
active:  Tell me
active:  broke in the engineer
noverb:  is Dr. Becher a German
noverb:  very thin
noverb:  with a long, sharp nose
active:  The station-master laughed heartily
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  Dr. Becher is an Englishman
noverb:  there isn't a man in the parish
active:  has a better-lined waistcoat
active:  he has a gentleman
active:  staying with him
noverb:  a patient
active:  I understand
noverb:  who is a foreigner
active:  he looks as
noverb:  a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
active:  The station-master had not finished his speech
active:  we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
active:  The road topped a low hill
active:  there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us
noverb:  spouting fire at every chink
noverb:  window
noverb:  in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
active:  That's it
active:  cried Hatherley
noverb:  in intense excitement
active:  There is the gravel-drive
active:  there are the rose-bushes
active:  I lay
active:  second window is the one
active:  I jumped from
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  at least
active:  said Holmes
active:  you have had your revenge upon them
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  that it was your oil-lamp
active:  it was crushed
noverb:  in the press
noverb:  set fire to the wooden walls
noverb:  no doubt
active:  they were too excited
noverb:  in the chase after you
active:  to observe it at the time
noverb:  Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night
noverb:  I very much fear
noverb:  they are a good hundred miles off by now
active:  And Holmes' fears came to be realised
noverb:  for from that day to this no word has
passive: ever been heard
noverb:  of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman
noverb:  Early
noverb:  morning a peasant had met a cart
active:  containing several people
noverb:  some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading
noverb:  there all traces of the fugitives disappeared
novoice: even Holmes' ingenuity failed
active:  to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
active:  The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
active:  they had found within
noverb:  still
active:  discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
noverb:  About sunset
noverb:  however
active:  their efforts were at last successful
active:  they subdued the flames
noverb:  not
active:  the roof had fallen in
passive: the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin
noverb:  save some twisted cylinders
noverb:  iron piping
novoice: not a trace remained of the machinery
active:  had cost our unfortunate acquaintance
noverb:  dearly
noverb:  Large masses of nickel
passive: of tin were discovered
novoice: stored in an out-house
active:  no coins were to be found
active:  may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes
passive: have been already referred to
passive: our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot
active:  he recovered his senses
active:  might have remained forever a mystery
active:  were it not for the soft mould
noverb:  told us a very plain tale
passive: He had evidently been carried down by two persons
noverb:  one of
active:  had remarkably small feet
noverb:  the other unusually large ones
noverb:  On the whole
active:  it was most
noverb:  probable
noverb:  the silent Englishman
active:  being less bold
noverb:  less murderous
noverb:  his companion
active:  had assisted the woman
active:  to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
noverb:  Well
active:  said our engineer ruefully
active:  we took our seats
active:  to return once
noverb:  to London
active:  it has been a pretty business for me
active:  I have lost my thumb
active:  I have lost a fifty-guinea fee
active:  have I gained
noverb:  Experience
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  Indirectly it may be of value
active:  you know
active:  you have only
active:  to put it into words
active:  to gain the reputation
active:  being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
noverb:  X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
noverb:  The Lord St. Simon marriage
noverb:  its curious termination
active:  have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in
active:  the unfortunate bridegroom moves
active:  Fresh scandals have eclipsed it
active:  their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama
active:  As I have reason
active:  to believe
noverb:  however
passive: the full facts have never been revealed to the general public
active:  my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share
active:  clearing the matter up
active:  I feel
active:  no memoir of him would be complete
noverb:  without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
active:  It was a few weeks
noverb:  my own marriage
noverb:  during the days
active:  I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street
active:  he came home from an afternoon stroll
active:  to find a letter on the table waiting for him
active:  I had remained indoors all day
active:  for the weather had taken a sudden turn
active:  to rain, with high autumnal winds,
noverb:  the Jezail bullet
active:  I had brought back in one of my limbs
active:  a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
noverb:  With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another
active:  I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
passive: saturated with the news of the day
noverb:  I tossed them all aside
active:  lay listless
noverb:  watching the huge crest
noverb:  monogram upon the envelope upon the table
active:  wondering lazily
active:  my friend's noble correspondent could be
active:  Here is a very fashionable epistle
active:  I remarked
active:  he entered
noverb:  Your morning letters
active:  I remember right
active:  were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
noverb:  Yes
active:  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety
active:  he answered
noverb:  smiling
active:  and the humbler are usually the more interesting
active:  This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses
noverb:  call upon a man
passive: to be bored
active:  to lie
active:  He broke the seal
active:  glanced over the contents
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
active:  it may prove to be something of interest
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Not social
noverb:  No
noverb:  distinctly professional
noverb:  And from a noble client
noverb:  One of the highest in England
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  I congratulate you
active:  I assure you
noverb:  Watson, without affectation,
active:  the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
noverb:  the interest of his case
active:  It is just possible
noverb:  , however
active:  also may not be wanting in this new investigation
active:  You have been reading the papers diligently of late
active:  have you not
active:  It looks like
noverb:  it
active:  said I ruefully
active:  pointing to a huge bundle in the corner
active:  I have had nothing else
active:  to do
active:  It is fortunate
noverb:  , for you will perhaps be able
active:  to post me up
active:  I read nothing
noverb:  the criminal news and the agony column
active:  The latter is always instructive
active:  you have followed recent events
active:  closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  with the deepest interest
active:  That is well
noverb:  The letter
active:  I hold
active:  in my hand is from Lord St. Simon

noverb:  therefore
active:  to call upon
noverb:  you
active:  to consult you in reference to the very painful event
active:  has occurred in connection with my wedding
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter
active:  he assures me
active:  he sees no objection to your co-operation
noverb:  he even thinks
active:  it might be of some assistance
active:  I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon
active:  should you have any other engagement at
noverb:  time
active:  I hope
active:  you will postpone it
active:  this matter is of paramount importance
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  ST. SIMON
passive: It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions
active:  written with a quill pen
active:  the noble lord has had the misfortune
active:  to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger
active:  remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle
active:  He says four o'clock
active:  It is three
noverb:  now
active:  He will be here
noverb:  in an hour
active:  I have just time, with your assistance,
active:  to get clear upon the subject
noverb:  Turn over those papers
active:  arrange the extracts in their order of time
active:  I take a glance as to
active:  our client is

noverb:  Tudor on the distaff side
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  very instructive in all this
active:  I think
active:  I must turn to
noverb:  you Watson
noverb:  for something more solid
active:  I have very little difficulty
active:  finding
active:  I want
active:  said I
active:  for the facts are quite recent
active:  the matter struck me as remarkable
active:  I feared to refer them to you
noverb:  however
active:  I knew
active:  you had an inquiry on hand
active:  you disliked the intrusion of other matters
noverb:  Oh
active:  you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van
active:  That is quite cleared up now
noverb:  indeed
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  Pray
noverb:  give me the results of your newspaper selections
active:  Here is the first notice
active:  I can find
active:  It is in the personal column of the Morning Post
noverb:  dates
noverb:  as you see
active:  some weeks back
passive: A marriage has been arranged
active:  it says
active:  will
active:  rumour is correct
noverb:  very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral

noverb:  the only daughter of Aloysius Doran
noverb:  Esq.
noverb:  of San Francisco
noverb:  Cal.
noverb:  U.S.A.
active:  is all
noverb:  Terse
noverb:  to the point
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  stretching his long
active:  thin legs towards the fire
active:  There was a paragraph
active:  amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  here it is
active:  There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market
active:  for the present free-trade principle appears
active:  to tell heavily against our home product
noverb:  One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic
passive: An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes

active:  it is an open secret
passive: the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled
active:  to sell his pictures within the last few years
active:  Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance
active:  will enable her
active:  to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress
noverb:  Anything else
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  plenty

noverb:  in the Morning Post
active:  to say
active:  the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one
active:  it would be at St. George's
noverb:  Hanover Square
noverb:  only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited
active:  the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate

active:  there is a curt announcement
noverb:  that the wedding had taken place

noverb:  near Petersfield
noverb:  Those are all the notices
active:  appeared
noverb:  the disappearance of the bride
noverb:  the

noverb:  The vanishing of the lady
active:  When did she vanish
noverb:  At the wedding breakfast
noverb:  Indeed
active:  This is more interesting
novoice: it promised
active:  to be
noverb:  quite dramatic
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  it struck me
active:  being a little out of the common
active:  They often vanish
noverb:  the ceremony
noverb:  occasionally during the honeymoon
active:  I cannot call
active:  to mind anything quite
noverb:  prompt as this
active:  Pray
noverb:  let me have the details
active:  I warn you
active:  they are very incomplete
active:  Perhaps we may make them
noverb:  Such as they are
passive: they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday
active:  I will read to
noverb:  you
passive: It is headed
noverb:  Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

active:  have taken place in connection with his wedding
noverb:  The ceremony
noverb:  as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday
active:  occurred on the previous morning
active:  it is only now
active:  it has been possible
active:  to confirm the strange rumours
active:  have been
active:  persistently floating about
noverb:  In spite of the attempts of the friends
active:  to hush the matter up
noverb:  much public attention has
passive: now been drawn to it
passive: no good purpose can be served
active:  affecting
active:  to disregard
active:  is a common subject for conversation
noverb:  The ceremony
passive: was performed at St. George's
noverb:  Hanover Square

noverb:  sister of the bridegroom)
noverb:  Lady Alicia Whittington
active:  The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate,
passive: breakfast had been prepared
active:  It appears
passive: some little trouble was caused by a woman
passive: name has not been ascertained
active:  endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party
active:  alleging
active:  she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon
active:  It was only after a painful
noverb:  prolonged scene
passive: she was ejected by the butler and the footman
noverb:  The bride
active:  had fortunately entered the house
noverb:  this unpleasant interruption
active:  had sat down
active:  to breakfast with the rest
active:  she complained of a sudden indisposition

active:  One of the footmen declared
noverb:  he had seen a lady leave the house
novoice: apparelled
active:  had refused
active:  to credit
active:  it was his mistress
noverb:  , believing her
active:  to be with the company
active:  ascertaining
active:  his daughter had disappeared
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  in conjunction with the bridegroom
novoice: put themselves in communication with the police
passive: very energetic inquiries are being made
active:  will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
noverb:  Up to a late hour last night
noverb:  however
active:  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady
active:  There are rumours
noverb:  of foul play in the matter
active:  it is said
active:  the police have caused the arrest of the woman
active:  had caused the original disturbance
noverb:  in the belief
passive: from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
active:  And is
noverb:  all
noverb:  Only one little item in another of the morning papers
active:  it is a suggestive one
active:  And it is
noverb:  That Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  the lady
active:  had caused the disturbance
passive: has actually been arrested
active:  It appears
active:  she was formerly a danseuse
noverb:  at the Allegro
active:  she has known the bridegroom for some years
active:  There are no further particulars
active:  the whole case is in your hands now
passive: it has been set forth in the public press
noverb:  And an exceedingly interesting case it appears
active:  to be
active:  I would not have missed it for worlds
active:  there is a ring
noverb:  at the bell, Watson,
active:  as the clock makes it a few minutes after four
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this will prove to be our noble client
active:  Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer
active:  having a witness
noverb:  only as a check to my own memory
noverb:  Lord Robert St. Simon
active:  announced our page-boy
noverb:  throwing open the door
active:  A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale
noverb:  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
noverb:  with the steady, well-opened eye of a man
noverb:  pleasant lot
active:  it had ever been
active:  to command
passive: to be obeyed
active:  His manner was brisk
active:  his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
noverb:  for he had a slight forward stoop
noverb:  a little bend of the knees
active:  he walked
noverb:  His hair
noverb:  too
noverb:  as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat
active:  was grizzled round the edges
noverb:  thin upon the top
noverb:  As to his dress
active:  it was careful
noverb:  to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat
noverb:  white waistcoat
noverb:  yellow gloves
noverb:  patent-leather shoes
noverb:  light-coloured gaiters
active:  He advanced slowly into the room
active:  turning his head from left to right
noverb:  swinging in his right hand the cord
active:  held his golden eyeglasses
noverb:  Good-day
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said Holmes, rising and bowing
noverb:  Pray take the basket-chair
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  Draw up a little to the fire
active:  we will talk this matter over
noverb:  A most painful matter to me
noverb:  as you can most readily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: I have been cut to the quick
active:  I understand
active:  you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
active:  I presume
active:  they were hardly from the same class of society
noverb:  No
active:  I am descending
active:  I beg pardon
active:  My last client of the sort was a king
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  really
active:  I had no idea
noverb:  And
noverb:  king
noverb:  The King of Scandinavia
passive: Had
active:  he lost his wife
active:  You can understand
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
active:  I promise to
noverb:  you in yours
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  Very right! very right
noverb:  I'm sure I beg pardon
noverb:  As to my own case
active:  I am ready
noverb:  to give you any information
active:  may assist you
active:  forming an opinion
active:  Thank you
active:  I have already learned all
active:  is in the public prints
noverb:  nothing
active:  I presume
active:  I may take it as correct
noverb:  this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride
novoice: Lord St. Simon glanced over
noverb:  it
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is correct
noverb:  ,
active:  it goes
active:  it needs a great deal
active:  supplementing
active:  anyone could offer an opinion
active:  I think
active:  I may arrive at my facts most directly
active:  questioning you
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
noverb:  In San Francisco
noverb:  a year ago
active:  You were travelling in the States
noverb:  Yes
active:  Did you become engaged
noverb:  No
active:  you were on a friendly footing
passive: I was amused by her society
active:  she could see
passive: I was amused
active:  Her father is very rich
passive: He is said
active:  to be the richest man on the Pacific slope
noverb:  And
active:  did he make his money
noverb:  In mining
active:  He had nothing a few years ago
noverb:  he struck gold
active:  invested it
active:  came up by leaps and bounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  is your own impression as to the young lady's
noverb:  your wife's character
active:  The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster
novoice: stared down into the fire
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  my wife was twenty
active:  her father became a rich man
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  she ran free in a mining camp
active:  wandered through woods
noverb:  mountains
active:  her education has come from Nature rather
noverb:  from the schoolmaster
active:  She is
active:  we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild
noverb:  free
noverb:  unfettered by any sort of traditions
active:  She is impetuous
noverb:  --volcanic
active:  I was about
active:  to say
active:  She is swift
noverb:  in making up her mind
noverb:  fearless
active:  carrying out her resolutions
noverb:  On the other hand
noverb:  I would not have given her the name
active:  I have the honour
active:  to bear
noverb:  --he gave a little stately cough--
active:  had I not thought her
active:  to be at bottom a noble woman
active:  I believe
active:  she is capable
noverb:  of heroic self-sacrifice
noverb:  anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
active:  Have you her photograph
active:  I brought this with me
active:  He opened a locket
noverb:  showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
active:  It was not a photograph
noverb:  but an ivory miniature
active:  the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair
noverb:  the large dark eyes
noverb:  the exquisite mouth
active:  Holmes gazed long
noverb:  earnestly at it
active:  he closed the locket
active:  handed it back to Lord St. Simon
active:  The young lady came to London
active:  you renewed your acquaintance
noverb:  Yes
active:  her father brought her over for this last London season
active:  I met her several times
active:  became engaged to her
active:  have
active:  now married her
active:  She brought
active:  I understand
noverb:  a considerable dowry
noverb:  A fair dowry
active:  Not more than is usual in my family
noverb:  And this
noverb:  of course
noverb:  remains to you
active:  the marriage is a fait accompli
active:  I really have made no inquiries on the subject
noverb:  Very naturally not
active:  Did you see Miss Doran on the day
noverb:  the wedding
noverb:  Yes
active:  Was she in good spirits
noverb:  Never better
active:  She kept talking of
active:  we should do in our future lives
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is very interesting
noverb:  And on the morning of the wedding
active:  She was
noverb:  possible
noverb:  at least until after the ceremony
active:  And did you observe any change in her
noverb:  Well,
active:  to tell the truth
active:  I saw
noverb:  the first signs
active:  I had
noverb:  seen
active:  her temper was just a little sharp
noverb:  The incident however
active:  was too trivial
active:  to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
active:  Pray
noverb:  let us have it
noverb:  for all that
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is childish
active:  She dropped her bouquet
active:  we went towards the vestry
active:  She was passing the front pew at the time
noverb:  it fell over into the pew
active:  There was a moment's delay
active:  the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again
active:  it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
active:  Yet when I spoke to her of the matter
active:  she answered me abruptly
noverb:  and in the carriage
noverb:  on our way home
active:  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
noverb:  Indeed
active:  You say
active:  there was a gentleman
noverb:  in the pew
active:  Some of the general public were present
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  It is impossible
active:  to exclude them
active:  the church is open
active:  This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  I call him a gentleman by courtesy
active:  he was quite a common-looking person
active:  I hardly noticed his appearance
active:  really I think
active:  we are wandering rather far from the point
noverb:  Lady St. Simon
novoice: returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind
active:  she had gone to
noverb:  it
active:  did
noverb:  she do on re-entering her father's house
active:  I saw her in conversation with her maid
noverb:  And
noverb:  is her maid
noverb:  Alice is her name
active:  She is an American
active:  came from California with her
noverb:  A confidential servant
noverb:  A little too much
active:  It seemed to me
active:  her mistress allowed her
active:  to take great liberties
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  in America they look upon these things in a different way
noverb:  long did she speak to this Alice
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  a few minutes
active:  I had something else
active:  to think of
active:  You did not overhear
active:  they said
active:  Lady St. Simon said
noverb:  something about 'jumping a claim
passive: She was accustomed
active:  to use slang of the kind
active:  I have no idea
active:  she meant
active:  American slang is very expressive sometimes
noverb:  And
active:  did your wife
active:  do
active:  she finished speaking to her maid
active:  She walked into the breakfast-room
noverb:  On your arm
noverb:  No
noverb:  alone
active:  She was very independent
noverb:  in little matters
noverb:  that
noverb:  after we had sat down for ten minutes
active:  she rose hurriedly
active:  muttered some words of apology
active:  left the room
active:  She never came back
noverb:  this maid, Alice
active:  I understand
active:  deposes
active:  she went to her room
active:  covered her bride's dress with a long ulster
noverb:  put on a bonnet
active:  went out
noverb:  Quite
active:  And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
noverb:  a woman
active:  is now in custody
noverb:  had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
noverb:  your relations to her
active:  Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders
active:  raised his eyebrows
active:  We have been on a friendly footing for some years
active:  I may say on a very friendly footing
active:  She used
active:  to be at the Allegro
active:  I have not treated her ungenerously
active:  she had no just cause of complaint against me
active:  you know
active:  women are
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Flora was a dear little thing
noverb:  exceedingly hot-headed
novoice: devotedly attached to me
noverb:  She wrote me dreadful letters
active:  she heard
active:  I was about
passive: to be married
active:  to tell the truth
noverb:  the reason
noverb:  I had the marriage celebrated
active:  quietly was
active:  I feared
active:  there might be a scandal
noverb:  in the church
active:  She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we
active:  returned
active:  she endeavoured to push her way in
active:  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife
active:  even threatening her
active:  I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort
noverb:  I had two police fellows there in private clothes
active:  soon pushed her out again
active:  She was quiet
noverb:  when she saw
active:  there was no good
active:  making a row
active:  Did your wife hear all this
noverb:  No
active:  thank goodness
active:  she did not
active:  And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
noverb:  Yes
active:  That is
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious
active:  It is thought
active:  Flora decoyed my wife out
active:  laid some terrible trap for her
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a possible supposition
active:  You think
noverb:  too
active:  I did not say a probable one
noverb:  you do not yourself look upon this as likely
active:  I do not think Flora
active:  would hurt a fly
noverb:  Still,
active:  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters
active:  Pray
active:  is your own theory as to
active:  took place
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I came to seek a theory
noverb:  not
active:  to propound one
noverb:  I have given you all the facts
active:  you ask me
noverb:  however
active:  I may say
active:  it has occurred to me as possible
noverb:  the excitement of this affair
noverb:  the consciousness
active:  she had made so immense a social stride
active:  had the effect
active:  causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
noverb:  In short
active:  she had become suddenly deranged
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I consider
active:  she has turned her back
active:  I will not say upon me
noverb:  upon
noverb:  much
noverb:  many have aspired to without success
active:  I can hardly explain it in any other fashion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  certainly
active:  is also a conceivable hypothesis
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I think
active:  I have nearly all my data
active:  May I ask
passive: you were seated at the breakfast-table
active:  you could see out of the window
active:  We could see the other side of the road and the Park
noverb:  Quite
active:  Then I do not think
active:  I need to detain you longer
active:  I shall communicate with
noverb:  you
passive: Should
active:  you be fortunate enough
active:  to solve this problem
active:  said our client, rising
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Eh
active:  was that
active:  I say
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Where
active:  is my wife
active:  That is a detail
active:  I shall speedily supply
active:  Lord St. Simon shook his head
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it will take wiser heads
noverb:  yours
noverb:  mine
active:  he remarked
noverb:  bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner
active:  he departed
active:  It is very good
noverb:  of Lord St. Simon
active:  to honour my head
active:  putting it on a level with his own
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I think
active:  I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning
active:  I had formed my conclusions as to the case
active:  our client came into the room
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  I have notes of several similar cases
noverb:  none
active:  I remarked before
active:  were quite as prompt
active:  My whole examination served
active:  to turn my conjecture into a certainty
active:  Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing
noverb:  as
active:  you find a trout in the milk
active:  to quote Thoreau's example
active:  I have heard all
active:  you have heard
noverb:  Without
noverb:  however
noverb:  the knowledge of pre-existing cases
active:  serves me
noverb:  well
noverb:  There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back
noverb:  something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War
active:  It is one of these cases
noverb:  hullo
active:  here is Lestrade
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard
active:  there are cigars
noverb:  in the box
passive: The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket
noverb:  cravat
active:  gave him a decidedly nautical appearance
active:  he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
active:  With a short greeting he seated himself
active:  lit the cigar
passive: had been offered to him
active:  What's up
active:  asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye
active:  You look dissatisfied
active:  And I feel dissatisfied
active:  It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case
active:  I can make
noverb:  head
noverb:  tail of the business
noverb:  Really
active:  You surprise me
novoice: ever heard of such a mixed affair
active:  Every clue seems
active:  to slip through my fingers
active:  I have been at work upon it all day
noverb:  And very wet it seems to have made you
noverb:  said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have been dragging the Serpentine
noverb:  In heaven's name
noverb:  for
noverb:  In search of the body of Lady St. Simon
active:  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair
novoice: laughed heartily
active:  Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain
active:  he asked
noverb:  do you mean
active:  you have just as good a chance
active:  finding this lady in the one as in the other
active:  Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion
active:  I suppose
active:  you know all about it
active:  he snarled
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have only just heard the facts
passive: my mind is made up
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  you think
noverb:  the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
active:  I think it very unlikely
noverb:  perhaps you will kindly explain
active:  it is
active:  we found this in it
active:  He opened his bag as he spoke
active:  tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk
noverb:  a pair of white satin shoes
noverb:  a bride's wreath
noverb:  veil
noverb:  all discoloured and soaked in water
noverb:  There
active:  said he
active:  putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile
active:  There is a little nut for you
active:  to crack
noverb:  Master Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  said
noverb:  my friend
noverb:  blowing blue rings into the air
active:  You dragged them from the Serpentine
noverb:  No
noverb:  They
passive: were found
active:  floating near the margin by a park-keeper
passive: They have been identified as her clothes
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  the clothes were there
active:  the body would not be far off
noverb:  By the same brilliant reasoning
active:  every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe
active:  And pray
active:  did you hope
active:  to arrive at through this
active:  At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that you will find it difficult
active:  Are you
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  now
active:  cried Lestrade with some bitterness
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , Holmes
active:  you are not very practical
noverb:  with your deductions and your inferences
active:  You have made two blunders in as many minutes
active:  This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  And
active:  In the dress is a pocket
active:  In the pocket is a card-case
active:  In the card-case is a note
active:  And here is the very note
active:  He slapped it down upon the table in front of him
active:  Listen to this
active:  You will see me
noverb:  all is ready
active:  Come at once
noverb:  F. H. M.' Now my theory all
active:  has been
passive: Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar
noverb:  she, with confederates, no doubt
active:  was responsible for her disappearance
noverb:  Here,
passive: signed with her initials
active:  is the very note
passive: was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door
active:  lured her within their reach
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  You really are very fine indeed
noverb:  Let me see it
active:  He took up the paper in a listless way
noverb:  his attention
active:  became
novoice: riveted
active:  he gave a little cry of satisfaction
active:  This is indeed important
active:  said he
noverb:  Ha! you find it
noverb:  Extremely
active:  I congratulate you warmly
active:  Lestrade rose in his triumph
active:  bent his head
active:  to look
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  you
active:  looking at the wrong side
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  this is the right side
noverb:  The right side
noverb:  You're mad
noverb:  Here is the note written in pencil over here
active:  And over here is
active:  appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill
active:  interests me deeply
active:  There's nothing in it
active:  I looked at it before
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  Oct. 4th
noverb:  rooms 8s
noverb:  breakfast 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  cocktail 1s
noverb:  lunch 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  glass sherry
noverb:  8d
active:  I see nothing in that
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  It is most
noverb:  important
noverb:  all the same
noverb:  As to the note
active:  it is important also
noverb:  ,
active:  at least the initials are
active:  I congratulate you again
noverb:  I've wasted time enough
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  rising
active:  I believe in hard work
noverb:  not
active:  sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
noverb:  Good-day, Mr. Holmes
active:  we shall see
active:  gets to the bottom of the matter first
active:  He gathered up the garments
novoice: thrust them into the bag
novoice: made for the door
noverb:  Just one hint to you, Lestrade
active:  drawled Holmes
noverb:  his rival vanished
noverb:  I will tell you the true solution of the matter
active:  Lady St. Simon is a myth
active:  There is not
active:  there never has been
noverb:  any such person
active:  Lestrade looked sadly at my companion
active:  he turned to me
noverb:  tapped his forehead three times
active:  shook his head solemnly
noverb:  hurried away
active:  He had hardly shut the door behind him
active:  Holmes rose
active:  to put on his overcoat
active:  There is something
noverb:  in
active:  the fellow says about outdoor work
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  I must leave you to your papers for a little
active:  It was after five o'clock
active:  Sherlock Holmes left me
novoice: I had no time
active:  to be lonely
noverb:  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box
noverb:  This
active:  he unpacked with the help of a youth
active:  he had brought with him
active:  presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began
passive: to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany
active:  There were a couple
noverb:  of brace of cold woodcock
noverb:  a pheasant
noverb:  a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles
active:  Having laid out all these luxuries
active:  my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save
passive: the things had been paid for
passive: were ordered to this address
noverb:  Just
noverb:  nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room
passive: His features were gravely set
active:  there was a light in his eye
active:  made me think
passive: he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
active:  They have laid the supper
active:  he said
active:  rubbing his hands
active:  You seem to expect company
active:  They have laid for five
noverb:  Yes
active:  I fancy
active:  we may have some company
active:  dropping in
active:  said he
active:  I am surprised
active:  Lord St. Simon has not already arrived
noverb:  Ha
active:  I fancy
active:  I hear his step now upon the stairs
active:  It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon
active:  came bustling in
active:  dangling his glasses more vigorously
noverb:  with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
active:  My messenger reached you
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I confess
active:  the contents startled me beyond measure
noverb:  Have you good authority for
active:  you say
noverb:  The best possible
active:  Lord St. Simon sank into a chair
active:  passed his hand over his forehead
active:  will the Duke
active:  say
active:  he murmured
active:  when he hears
passive: one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
active:  It is the purest accident
active:  I cannot allow
active:  there is any humiliation
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  you look on these things from another standpoint
active:  I fail
active:  to see
active:  anyone is
active:  to blame
active:  I can hardly see
active:  the lady could have acted
noverb:  her abrupt method
active:  doing
active:  it was undoubtedly
passive: to be regretted
active:  Having no mother
active:  she had no one
active:  to advise her at such a crisis
active:  It was a slight
noverb:  sir
noverb:  a public slight
active:  said Lord St. Simon
active:  tapping his fingers upon the table
active:  You must make allowance for this poor girl
noverb:  placed in so unprecedented a position
active:  I will make no allowance
active:  I am very angry indeed
noverb:  ,
passive: I have been shamefully used
active:  I think
active:  I heard a ring
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Yes
novoice: there are steps on the landing
active:  If I cannot persuade you
active:  to take a lenient view of the matter
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I have brought an advocate here
active:  may be more successful
active:  He opened the door
active:  ushered in a lady and gentleman
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said he
active:  allow me
active:  to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton
noverb:  The lady
active:  I think
active:  you have already met
active:  At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat
active:  stood very erect
novoice: with his eyes cast down
passive: his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat
noverb:  a picture of offended dignity
active:  The lady had taken a quick step forward
active:  had held out her hand to him
novoice: he still refused
active:  to raise his eyes
active:  It was as well for his resolution
noverb:  perhaps
active:  for her pleading face was one
active:  it was hard
active:  to resist
noverb:  You're angry
noverb:  Robert
active:  said she
noverb:  Well,
active:  I guess
active:  you have every cause
active:  to be
noverb:  Pray make no apology to me
active:  said Lord St. Simon bitterly
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I know
active:  I have treated you real bad
active:  I should have spoken to
noverb:  you
active:  I went
active:  I was kind
noverb:  of rattled
noverb:  from the time
active:  I saw Frank here again I just didn't know
active:  I was doing or saying
active:  I only wonder I didn't fall down
noverb:  do a faint right there
noverb:  the altar
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mrs. Moulton
active:  you would like my friend
noverb:  me
active:  to leave the room
active:  you explain this matter
active:  I may give an opinion
active:  remarked the strange gentleman
noverb:  we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already
noverb:  For my part
active:  I should like all Europe and America
active:  to hear the rights of it
active:  He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face
noverb:  alert manner
active:  I'll tell our story right away
active:  said the lady
noverb:  Frank here
active:  I met in '84
noverb:  in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies,
active:  Pa was working a claim
passive: We were engaged to each other
noverb:  Frank
noverb:  I
active:  one day father struck a rich pocket
active:  made a pile
active:  poor Frank here had a claim
active:  petered out
active:  came to nothing
active:  The richer Pa grew
active:  the poorer was Frank
noverb:  at last Pa wouldn't hear
active:  of our engagement lasting any longer
active:  he took me away to 'Frisco
noverb:  Frank wouldn't throw up his hand
noverb:  though
noverb:  he followed me there
active:  he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it
active:  It would only have made him mad
active:  to know
active:  we just fixed it all up for ourselves
active:  Frank said
active:  he would go and make his pile
noverb:  too
noverb:  never come back
active:  to claim me
active:  he had
noverb:  Pa
active:  I promised
active:  to wait for him to the end of time
active:  pledged myself not
active:  to marry anyone else
active:  he lived
noverb:  shouldn't we be married right away
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I will feel sure of you
noverb:  and I won't claim
active:  to be your husband
active:  I come back
noverb:  Well,
active:  we talked it over
active:  he had fixed it all up
noverb:  nicely
noverb:  with a clergyman all ready in waiting
noverb:  we just did it right there
active:  and then Frank went off
active:  to seek his fortune
active:  I went back to Pa
noverb:  The next
active:  I heard of Frank was
active:  he was in Montana
active:  he went
active:  prospecting in Arizona
active:  I heard of him from New Mexico
noverb:  After
active:  came a long newspaper story about
passive: a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians
active:  there was my Frank's name
noverb:  among the killed
active:  I fainted dead away
active:  I was very sick
noverb:  for months after
active:  Pa thought
active:  I had a decline
active:  took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco
active:  Not a word of news came for a year
active:  I never doubted
active:  Frank was really dead
active:  Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco
active:  we came to London
passive: a marriage was arranged
active:  Pa was very pleased
active:  I felt all the time
active:  no man on this earth would
noverb:  take the place in my heart
passive: had been given to my poor Frank
noverb:  Still,
active:  I had married Lord St. Simon
noverb:  of course I'd have done my duty by him
noverb:  We can't command our love
active:  we can our actions
active:  I went to the altar with him with the intention
active:  to make him just as good a wife
active:  it was in me
active:  to be
active:  you may imagine
active:  I felt
noverb:  just
active:  I came to the altar rails
active:  I glanced back
active:  saw Frank standing
active:  looking at me out of the first pew
active:  I thought
active:  it was his ghost
noverb:  at first
active:  I looked again there
active:  he was still
noverb:  , with a kind of question in his eyes
noverb:  as
active:  to ask me
active:  I were glad or sorry
active:  to see him
active:  I wonder I didn't drop
active:  I know
active:  everything was turning round
active:  the words of the clergyman were just
noverb:  the buzz of a bee in my ear
noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  Should I stop the service
active:  make a scene in the church
active:  I glanced at him again
active:  he seemed to know
active:  I was thinking
noverb:  for he raised his finger to his lips
active:  to tell me
active:  to be still
noverb:  Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was writing me a note
active:  As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him
active:  he slipped the note into my hand
noverb:  he returned me the flowers
active:  It was only a line
active:  asking me
active:  to join him
active:  he made the sign to me
active:  to do
noverb:  Of course I never doubted for a moment
active:  my first duty was now to him
active:  I determined to do just
active:  he might direct
active:  When I got back
active:  I told my maid
active:  had known him in California
active:  had always been his friend
active:  I ordered her
active:  to say nothing
active:  to get a few things
novoice: packed
noverb:  my ulster ready
active:  I know
active:  I ought
active:  to have spoken to Lord St. Simon
active:  it was dreadful
noverb:  hard
noverb:  his mother and all those great people
active:  I just made up my mind
active:  to run away
active:  explain afterwards
noverb:  I hadn't been at the table ten minutes
active:  I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road
active:  He beckoned to me
active:  began walking into the Park
active:  I slipped out
noverb:  put on my things
active:  followed him
active:  Some woman came talking something
noverb:  other about Lord St. Simon to me
novoice: seemed to me from the little
active:  I heard as
active:  he had a little secret of his own
noverb:  marriage also
active:  I managed
active:  to get away from her
active:  soon overtook Frank
active:  We got into a cab together
noverb:  away we drove to some lodgings
active:  he had taken in Gordon Square
noverb:  was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
active:  Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches
active:  had escaped
active:  came on to 'Frisco
active:  found
active:  I had given him up for dead
active:  had gone to England
noverb:  followed me there
active:  had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
active:  I saw it in a paper
active:  explained the American
active:  It gave the name
noverb:  the church
noverb:  not
active:  the lady lived
active:  we had a talk as to
active:  we should do
active:  Frank was all for openness
active:  I was so ashamed
noverb:  of it all
active:  I felt as
active:  I should like to vanish away
active:  never see any of them again
noverb:  just sending a line to Pa
noverb:  perhaps
active:  to show him
active:  I was alive
active:  It was awful
noverb:  to me
active:  to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round
noverb:  breakfast-table and waiting for me
active:  to come back
active:  So Frank took my wedding-clothes
noverb:  things
active:  made a bundle of them
passive: I should not be traced
active:  dropped them away somewhere
active:  no one could find them
active:  It is likely
active:  we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow
noverb:  only
active:  this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening
active:  he found
active:  us is more than
active:  I can think
active:  he showed us very clearly
noverb:  kindly
active:  I was wrong
noverb:  and
active:  Frank was right
active:  we should be putting ourselves in the wrong
active:  we were so secret
noverb:  he offered to give us a chance
active:  talking to Lord St. Simon alone
active:  we came right away round to his rooms at once
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Robert
active:  you have heard it all
active:  I am very sorry
noverb:  if I have given you pain
active:  I hope
active:  you do not think very meanly of me
active:  Lord St. Simon had
active:  by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
active:  had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
active:  Excuse me
active:  he said
active:  it is not my custom
active:  to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
noverb:  you won't forgive me
noverb:  You won't shake hands
active:  I go
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  it would give you any pleasure
active:  He put out his hand
novoice: coldly grasped
active:  she extended to him
active:  I had hoped
active:  suggested Holmes
active:  you would have joined us in a friendly supper
active:  I think
noverb:  there
active:  you ask a little too much
active:  responded his Lordship
passive: I may be forced
active:  to acquiesce in these recent developments
passive: I can hardly be expected
active:  to make merry over them
active:  I think
noverb:  with your permission
active:  I will
active:  now wish you all a very good-night
active:  He included us all in a sweeping bow
novoice: stalked out of the room
active:  I trust
active:  you at least will honour me with your company
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is always a joy
active:  to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for
active:  I am one of those
active:  believe
active:  the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
active:  being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
active:  shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
active:  The case has been an interesting one
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  our visitors had left us
noverb:  it serves
active:  to show very clearly
noverb:  simple the explanation may be of an affair
active:  at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable
active:  Nothing could be more natural
noverb:  the sequence of events
passive: narrated by this lady
noverb:  nothing stranger
noverb:  than the result
novoice: viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard
active:  You were not yourself at fault at all
noverb:  From the first
active:  two facts were very obvious to me
noverb:  the one
active:  the lady had been quite willing
active:  to undergo the wedding ceremony
noverb:  the other
active:  she had repented of
noverb:  it within a few minutes of returning home
active:  Obviously something had occurred during the morning
active:  to cause her
noverb:  to change her mind
active:  could that something be
active:  She could not have spoken to anyone
active:  she was out
noverb:  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
noverb:  Had she seen someone
active:  she had
active:  it must be someone
noverb:  from America
active:  she had spent
noverb:  short a time in this country
active:  she could hardly have allowed anyone
active:  to acquire
noverb:  deep an influence over her
active:  the mere sight of him would induce her
active:  to change her plans
noverb:  completely
active:  You see
active:  we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea
active:  she might have seen an American
active:  could
novoice: this American be
active:  should he possess
noverb:  much influence over her
active:  It might be a lover
active:  it might be a husband
noverb:  Her young womanhood had
active:  I knew
passive: been spent in rough scenes
noverb:  under strange conditions
active:  So far I had got
active:  I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative
active:  When he told us of a man in a pew
noverb:  of the change in the bride's manner
noverb:  of so transparent a device
active:  obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet
noverb:  of her resort to her confidential maid
noverb:  of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping
noverb:  in miners' parlance means taking possession of
active:  another person has a prior claim to
active:  the whole situation became absolutely clear
active:  She had gone off with a man
active:  the man was
noverb:  a lover
active:  was a previous husband
novoice: the chances being in favour of the latter
noverb:  And
noverb:  in the world did you find them
active:  It might have been difficult
noverb:  friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of
noverb:  he did not himself know
active:  The initials were, of course, of the highest importance
noverb:  more valuable still was it
active:  to know
noverb:  within a week
active:  he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels
active:  did you deduce the select
noverb:  By the select prices
active:  Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels
active:  There are not many
noverb:  in London
active:  charge at
noverb:  rate
noverb:  In the second one
active:  I visited in Northumberland Avenue
active:  I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton
noverb:  an American gentleman
active:  had left only the day before
active:  looking over the entries against him
active:  I came upon the very items
active:  I had seen in the duplicate bill
active:  His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square
active:  thither I travelled
novoice: being fortunate enough
active:  to find the loving couple at home
noverb:  I ventured to give them some paternal advice
active:  to point out to them
active:  it would be better
noverb:  in every way
noverb:  they should make their position a little clearer
noverb:  both to the general public
noverb:  to Lord St. Simon in particular
active:  I invited them
noverb:  to meet him here
noverb:  as you see
noverb:  I made him keep the appointment
noverb:  with no very good result
active:  I remarked
active:  His conduct was certainly not very gracious
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  perhaps you would not be very gracious
active:  , after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife
noverb:  of fortune
active:  I think
active:  we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
active:  thank our stars
active:  we are never likely
active:  to find ourselves in the same position
noverb:  Draw your chair up
noverb:  hand me my violin
active:  for the only problem we have still
active:  to solve
active:  is
noverb:  to
noverb:  away these bleak autumnal evenings
noverb:  XI
noverb:  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
noverb:  Holmes
active:  said I
active:  I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street
active:  here is a madman coming along
active:  It seems rather sad
active:  his relatives should allow him
active:  to come out alone
noverb:  My friend rose lazily from his armchair
novoice: stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown
noverb:  looking over my shoulder
active:  It was a bright, crisp February morning
noverb:  the snow of the day
noverb:  still lay deep upon the ground
noverb:  shimmering brightly in the wintry sun
passive: Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic
noverb:  at
noverb:  side
noverb:  on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay
active:  it fell
passive: The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped
active:  was still dangerously slippery
active:  there were fewer passengers
noverb:  usual
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
active:  eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
active:  He was a man
noverb:  of about fifty, tall, portly
noverb:  imposing
noverb:  with a massive
active:  strongly marked face and a commanding figure
passive: He was dressed in a sombre
noverb:  rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters
noverb:  well-cut pearl-grey trousers
active:  Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
noverb:  features
noverb:  for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
passive: is little accustomed
active:  to set any tax upon his legs
active:  he ran
active:  he jerked his hands up and down
active:  waggled his head
active:  writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
active:  on earth can be the matter with him
active:  I asked
active:  He is looking up at the numbers of the houses
active:  I believe
active:  he is coming here
active:  said Holmes
active:  rubbing his hands
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
active:  I rather think
active:  he is coming to consult me professionally
active:  I think
active:  I recognise the symptoms
noverb:  Ha! did I not tell you
noverb:  As he spoke
noverb:  the man
noverb:  puffing
noverb:  blowing
noverb:  rushed at our door
novoice: pulled
novoice: at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
noverb:  A few moments later he was in our room
noverb:  still puffing
noverb:  still gesticulating
noverb:  with
active:  fixed a look of grief
noverb:  despair in his eyes
active:  our smiles
passive: were turned in an instant to horror and pity
active:  For a while he could not get his words out
active:  swayed his body
novoice: plucked at his hair
noverb:  one
passive: has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason
active:  suddenly springing to his feet
active:  he beat his head against the wall with such force
noverb:  we
noverb:  rushed upon him
active:  tore him away to the centre of the room
active:  Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair
noverb:  sitting beside him
active:  patted his hand
novoice: chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones
active:  he knew
noverb:  well
active:  to employ
active:  You have come to me
active:  to tell your story
active:  have you not
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: You are fatigued with your haste
active:  Pray wait
active:  you have recovered yourself
active:  I shall be most happy
active:  to look into any little problem
active:  you may submit to me
noverb:  The man sat for a minute
noverb:  with a heaving chest
noverb:  fighting against his emotion
active:  he passed his handkerchief over his brow
noverb:  set his lips tight
active:  turned his face towards us
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you think me mad
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I see
active:  you have had some great trouble
active:  responded Holmes
active:  God knows
novoice: I have!
noverb:  a trouble
active:  is enough
active:  to unseat my reason
noverb:  sudden
noverb:  so terrible is it
noverb:  Public disgrace I might have faced
active:  I am a man
noverb:  whose character has never yet borne a stain
active:  Private affliction also is the lot of every man
active:  the two coming together
noverb:  in so frightful a form
active:  have been enough
active:  to shake my very soul
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is not I alone
active:  The very noblest in the land may suffer
passive: some way be found out of this horrible affair
active:  Pray
active:  compose yourself, sir
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  and let me have a clear account of
active:  you are
active:  it is
active:  has befallen you
noverb:  My name
active:  answered our visitor
active:  is probably familiar to your ears
active:  I am Alexander Holder
noverb:  ,
noverb:  of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson
noverb:  of Threadneedle Street
active:  The name was indeed well known to us
active:  belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London
active:  could have happened
active:  to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass
active:  We waited
noverb:  all curiosity
noverb:  until with another effort
active:  he braced himself
active:  to tell his story
active:  I feel
active:  time is of value
active:  said he
active:  that is
active:  I hastened here
active:  the police inspector suggested
active:  I should secure your co-operation
active:  I came to Baker Street by the Underground
active:  hurried from there on foot
active:  for the cabs go slowly through this snow
active:  That is
active:  I was
noverb:  out of breath
noverb:  for
active:  I am a man
noverb:  who takes very little exercise
active:  I feel better now
active:  I will put the facts
noverb:  you as shortly
noverb:  yet
active:  I can
active:  It is
noverb:  of course
active:  well known to
noverb:  you
noverb:  in a successful banking business
novoice: much depends upon our being able
active:  to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
noverb:  the number of our depositors
noverb:  One of our most lucrative means
active:  laying out
active:  money is in the shape of loans
active:  the security is unimpeachable
active:  We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years
active:  there are many noble families to
active:  we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures
noverb:  libraries
noverb:  plate
noverb:  Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank
passive: a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
active:  I started
active:  I saw the name
active:  for it was
noverb:  of none other than
noverb:  well
noverb:  perhaps even to you I had
active:  better say no more than
active:  it was a name
noverb:  which is a household word all over the earth
noverb:  one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England
passive: I was overwhelmed by the honour
noverb:  attempted
active:  he entered
active:  to say
active:  he plunged at once into business with the air of a man
active:  wishes
active:  to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: I have been informed
active:  you are in the habit of advancing money
active:  The firm does
active:  the security is good
active:  I answered
active:  It is absolutely essential
noverb:  to me
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I should have $50,000 at once
active:  I could, of course, borrow
noverb:  trifling a sum ten times over from my friends
noverb:  I much prefer to make it a matter of business
active:  to carry out
noverb:  business myself
noverb:  In my position
active:  you can readily understand
active:  it is unwise
active:  to place one's self under obligations
noverb:  For
noverb:  long
active:  may I ask
active:  do you want this sum
active:  I asked
active:  Next Monday I have a large sum due to me
active:  I shall
active:  most certainly repay
noverb:  you advance
noverb:  with
active:  interest
active:  you think it right
active:  to charge
active:  it is very essential
noverb:  to me
passive: the money should be paid at once
active:  I should be happy
active:  to advance it without further parley from my own private purse
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  were it not
active:  the strain would be rather more than
active:  it could bear
active:  , on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm
active:  in justice to my partner I must insist
noverb:  even in your case
passive: every businesslike precaution should be taken
noverb:  I should much prefer to have it
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  raising up a square, black morocco case
active:  he had laid beside his chair
active:  You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
noverb:  One of the most precious public possessions of the empire
active:  said I.
noverb:  Precisely
active:  He opened the case
noverb:  there
passive: imbedded in soft
noverb:  flesh-coloured velvet
noverb:  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
active:  he had named
active:  There are thirty-nine enormous beryls
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the price of the gold chasing
active:  is incalculable
active:  The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum
active:  I have asked
passive: I am prepared
active:  to leave it with you as my security
active:  I took the precious case into my hands
novoice: looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
active:  You doubt its value
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  I only doubt
noverb:  The propriety of my leaving it
active:  You may set your mind at rest about that
active:  I should not dream
active:  doing
active:  so were it not absolutely certain
noverb:  that I should be able
noverb:  in four days
active:  to reclaim it
active:  It is a pure matter of form
active:  Is the security sufficient
noverb:  Ample
active:  You understand
noverb:  Mr. Holder
noverb:  I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence
active:  I have in
noverb:  you
noverb:  founded upon all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you
active:  I rely upon
noverb:  you not only
active:  to be discreet
active:  to refrain from all gossip upon the matter
noverb:  above all
active:  to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution
active:  I need
active:  not say
passive: a great public scandal would be caused
active:  any harm were to befall it
active:  Any injury to it would be almost
noverb:  its complete loss
active:  for there are no beryls
noverb:  in the world
active:  to match these
active:  it would be impossible
active:  to replace them
active:  I leave it with you
noverb:  however, with every confidence,
active:  I shall call for
noverb:  it in person on Monday morning
active:  Seeing
active:  my client was anxious
active:  to leave
active:  I said no
active:  calling for my cashier
active:  I ordered him
active:  to pay over fifty $1000 notes
active:  When I was alone once
noverb:  however
noverb:  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me
active:  I could not
noverb:  think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
novoice: it entailed upon me
active:  There could be no doubt
noverb:  that
active:  it was a national possession
active:  a horrible scandal would ensue
active:  any misfortune should occur to
noverb:  it
noverb:  I
novoice: already regretted
active:  having ever consented to take charge of it
noverb:  However,
active:  it was too late
active:  to alter the matter now
active:  I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
noverb:  to my work
active:  When evening came
active:  I felt
active:  it would be an imprudence
active:  to leave
noverb:  precious a thing in the office behind me
passive: Bankers' safes had been forced
noverb:  now
active:  should not mine
active:  be
noverb:  terrible would be the position in
active:  I should find myself
active:  I determined
noverb:  therefore
noverb:  for the next few days
active:  I would always carry the case backward
noverb:  forward with me
active:  it might never be really out of my reach
noverb:  With this intention
active:  I called a cab
active:  drove out to my house at Streatham
active:  carrying the jewel with me
active:  I did not breathe freely
active:  I had taken it upstairs
active:  locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
noverb:  And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you
active:  to thoroughly understand the situation
noverb:  My groom
noverb:  my page sleep out of the house
passive: may be set aside altogether
active:  I have three maid-servants
active:  have been with me a number of years
active:  absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
noverb:  Another
noverb:  Lucy Parr
noverb:  the second waiting-maid
active:  has only been in my service a few months
active:  She came with an excellent character
noverb:  however
noverb:  has always given me satisfaction
active:  She is a very pretty girl
active:  has attracted admirers
active:  have occasionally hung about the place
active:  That is the only drawback
active:  we have found to her
active:  we believe her
active:  to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
noverb:  much for the servants
noverb:  My family
active:  itself is so small
noverb:  that it will not take me long
active:  to describe it
active:  I am a widower
active:  have an only son, Arthur
active:  He has been a disappointment to me
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  a grievous disappointment
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am myself
active:  to blame
active:  People tell me
active:  I have spoiled him
noverb:  Very likely I have
active:  When my dear wife died
active:  I felt
active:  he was all
active:  I had
active:  to love
active:  I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
noverb:  I have never denied him a wish
active:  Perhaps it would
active:  have been better for
novoice: of us had
novoice: I been sterner
active:  I meant it for the best
active:  It was naturally my intention
noverb:  that he should succeed me in my business
active:  he was not of a business turn
active:  He was wild
noverb:  wayward
active:  to speak the truth
active:  I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
noverb:  When
active:  he was young
active:  he became a member of an aristocratic club
noverb:  there
active:  having charming manners
active:  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
active:  He learned
active:  to play heavily at cards
active:  to squander money on the turf
active:  he had again
noverb:  again
active:  to come to me
active:  implore me
noverb:  to give him an advance upon his allowance
active:  he might settle his debts of honour
active:  He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company
active:  he was keeping
noverb:  each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough
active:  to draw him back again
noverb:  And,
noverb:  indeed
active:  I could not wonder
noverb:  such a man
active:  Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him
noverb:  for he has frequently brought him to my house
active:  I have found myself
active:  I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
active:  He is older
noverb:  than Arthur
noverb:  a man of the world to his finger-tips
noverb:  one
active:  had been everywhere
noverb:  seen everything
noverb:  a brilliant talker
noverb:  a man of great personal beauty
noverb:  Yet when I think of him in cold blood
noverb:  far away from the glamour of his presence
passive: I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look
active:  I have caught in his eyes
active:  he is one
noverb:  who should be deeply distrusted
active:  So I think
noverb:  too
active:  thinks my little Mary
active:  has a woman's quick insight into character
active:  And now there is only she
passive: to be described
active:  She is my niece
active:  my brother died five years ago
active:  left her alone in the world
active:  I adopted her
active:  have looked upon her
noverb:  as my daughter
active:  She is a sunbeam
noverb:  in my house
noverb:  sweet
noverb:  loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager
noverb:  housekeeper
noverb:  yet as tender
noverb:  quiet
noverb:  gentle as a woman could be
noverb:  She is my right hand
active:  I do not know
active:  I could do without her
active:  In only one matter has she
noverb:  gone against my wishes
active:  Twice my boy has asked her
active:  to marry him
noverb:  for he loves her devotedly
noverb:  each time
active:  she has refused him
active:  I think
active:  anyone could have drawn him into the right path
active:  it would have been she
active:  his marriage might have changed his whole life
noverb:  now
noverb:  alas!
active:  it is too late
noverb:  --forever too late
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you know the people
active:  live under my roof
active:  I shall continue with my miserable story
active:  When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
noverb:  night after dinner
active:  I told Arthur
noverb:  Mary my experience
noverb:  of the precious treasure
active:  we had under our roof
active:  suppressing only the name of my client
noverb:  Lucy Parr
active:  had brought in the coffee
active:  had
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , left the room
active:  I cannot swear
passive: the door was closed
noverb:  Mary
passive: Arthur were much interested and wished
active:  to see the famous coronet
active:  I thought it better not
active:  to disturb it
passive: Where have
active:  you put it
active:  asked Arthur
noverb:  In my own bureau
noverb:  Well,
active:  I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: It is locked up
active:  I answered
noverb:  Oh
active:  any old key will fit that bureau
active:  When I was a youngster
noverb:  I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
active:  He often had a wild way of talking
active:  I thought little of
active:  he said
active:  He followed me to my room
noverb:  however
noverb:  night with a very grave face
noverb:  Look here, dad
active:  said
active:  he with his eyes cast down
noverb:  can you let me have $200
noverb:  No
active:  I cannot
active:  I answered sharply
active:  I have been far too generous with you in money matters
active:  You have been very kind
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I must have this money
active:  else I can never show my face inside the club again
noverb:  And a very good thing
noverb:  too
active:  I cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not bear the disgrace
active:  I must raise the money in some way
noverb:  you will not let me have it
active:  I must try other means
active:  I was very angry
noverb:  , for this was the third demand during the month
active:  You shall not have a farthing from me
active:  I cried
noverb:  on
active:  he bowed and left the room without another word
passive: When he was gone
active:  I unlocked my bureau
noverb:  made sure
active:  my treasure was safe
active:  locked it again
active:  Then I started
active:  to go round the house
active:  to see
noverb:  all was secure
noverb:  a duty
active:  I usually leave to Mary
active:  I thought it well
noverb:  to perform myself that night
active:  As I came down the stairs
noverb:  I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall
active:  she closed and fastened
active:  I approached
noverb:  Tell me, dad,' said
noverb:  she
noverb:  looking
active:  I thought
noverb:  a little disturbed
active:  did you give Lucy
noverb:  the maid
noverb:  leave
active:  to go out to-night?
noverb:  Certainly not
active:  She came in just now by the back door
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she has only been to the side gate
active:  to see someone
active:  I think
active:  it is hardly safe
noverb:  and should be stopped
active:  You must speak to her in the morning
active:  I will
active:  you prefer it
active:  Are you sure
passive: everything is fastened
noverb:  Quite sure
noverb:  dad
noverb:  good-night
active:  I kissed her
active:  went up to my bedroom again
active:  I was soon asleep
noverb:  I am endeavouring to tell you everything
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  may have any bearing upon the case
active:  I beg
active:  you will question me upon any point
active:  I do not make clear
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  your statement is singularly lucid
active:  I come to a part of my story now in
active:  I should wish to be particularly
active:  I am not a very heavy sleeper
novoice: the anxiety in my mind tended
noverb:  no doubt
active:  to make me even
noverb:  usual
noverb:  About two in the morning
passive: I was awakened by some sound in the house
active:  It had ceased ere
novoice: I was wide
noverb:  awake
active:  it had left an impression behind it as
active:  a window had gently closed somewhere
active:  I lay listening with all my ears
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my horror
active:  there was a distinct sound of footsteps
active:  moving softly in the next room
active:  I slipped out of bed
noverb:  all palpitating with fear
active:  peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
noverb:  Arthur
active:  I screamed
noverb:  you villain! you thief
active:  dare
active:  you touch that coronet
active:  The gas was half up
active:  I had left it
noverb:  my unhappy boy
passive: dressed only in his shirt
noverb:  trousers
active:  was standing beside the light
noverb:  holding the coronet in his hands
active:  He appeared
active:  to be wrenching at
noverb:  it
active:  bending it with all his strength
active:  At my cry he dropped it from his grasp
active:  turned
noverb:  death
active:  I snatched it up
active:  examined it
noverb:  One of the gold corners
noverb:  with three of the beryls in it
active:  was missing
active:  You blackguard
active:  I shouted
noverb:  beside myself with rage
active:  You have destroyed it
noverb:  You have dishonoured me forever
active:  Where are the jewels
active:  you have stolen
noverb:  Stolen
active:  he cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  thief
active:  I roared
active:  shaking him by the shoulder
active:  There are none
active:  missing
active:  There cannot be any missing
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  There are three
noverb:  missing
active:  And you know
active:  they are
noverb:  Must I call you a liar
noverb:  a thief
active:  Did I not see
active:  you trying to tear off another piece
active:  You have called me names enough
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I will not stand it any longer
active:  I shall not say another word about this business
active:  you have chosen to insult me
active:  I will leave your house in the morning
noverb:  make my own way in the world
active:  You shall leave it in the hands of the police
active:  I cried half-mad with grief and rage
active:  I shall have this matter
novoice: probed to the bottom
active:  You shall learn nothing from me
active:  said
noverb:  he with a passion such as I should not have thought
active:  was in his nature
active:  you choose to call the police
active:  let the police
active:  find
active:  they can
active:  By this time the whole house was astir
noverb:  for I had raised my voice in my anger
active:  Mary was the first
active:  to rush into my room
noverb:  at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face
active:  she read the whole story
noverb:  , with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground
active:  I sent the house-maid for the police
active:  put the investigation into their hands at once
noverb:  When the inspector
active:  a constable entered the house, Arthur
novoice: had stood sullenly with his arms folded
active:  asked me
active:  it was my intention
active:  to charge him with theft
active:  I answered
active:  it had ceased to be a private matter
noverb:  had become a public one
active:  the ruined coronet was national property
active:  I was determined
active:  the law should have its way in everything
noverb:  At least,
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you will not have me arrested at once
active:  It would be to your advantage
noverb:  mine
active:  I might leave the house for five minutes
active:  you may get away
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you may conceal
active:  you have stolen
active:  said I. And
active:  realising the dreadful position in
passive: I was placed
active:  I implored him
active:  to remember
noverb:  not only my honour
noverb:  of one
noverb:  who was far greater
noverb:  than I was at stake
noverb:  and
active:  he threatened to raise a scandal
active:  would convulse the nation
active:  He might avert it all
active:  he would
active:  tell me
active:  he had done with the three missing stones
active:  You may as well face the matter
active:  said
noverb:  I
passive: you have been caught in the act
active:  no confession could make your guilt more heinous
noverb:  you
noverb:  make such reparation
active:  is in your power
active:  telling us
active:  the beryls are
noverb:  all shall be forgiven and forgotten
noverb:  Keep your forgiveness for those
active:  ask for it
active:  he answered
noverb:  turning away from me with a sneer
active:  I saw
active:  he was too hardened
noverb:  for any words of mine
active:  to influence him
active:  There was
noverb:  one way for it
active:  I called in the inspector
active:  gave him into custody
passive: A search was made at once not only of his person
noverb:  of his room
noverb:  of every portion of the house
active:  he could possibly have concealed the gems
passive: no trace of them could be found
noverb:  would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats
noverb:  This morning
passive: he was removed to a cell
noverb:  I
active:  going through all the police formalities
active:  have hurried round to you
active:  to implore you
active:  to use your skill
active:  unravelling the matter
active:  The police have openly confessed
active:  they can at present make nothing of it
active:  You may go to any expense
active:  you think necessary
active:  I have already offered a reward of $1000
noverb:  My God
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night
noverb:  Oh
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  He put a hand on
noverb:  side of his head
active:  rocked himself to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  droning to himself
noverb:  a child
active:  grief has got beyond words
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes
noverb:  , with his brows knitted
active:  his eyes fixed upon the fire
active:  Do you receive much company
active:  he asked
active:  None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's
active:  Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately
noverb:  No one else
active:  I think
active:  Do you go out much in society
active:  Arthur does
noverb:  Mary
active:  I stay at home
noverb:  We
noverb:  of us care for it
active:  That is unusual in a young girl
active:  She is of a quiet nature
noverb:  Besides
active:  she is not
noverb:  very young
active:  She is four-and
noverb:  -twenty
noverb:  This matter
noverb:  from
active:  you say
active:  seems to have been a shock to her also
noverb:  Terrible
active:  She is even more affected
noverb:  than I.
active:  You have
noverb:  of you any doubt as to your son's guilt
active:  can we have
active:  I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
active:  I hardly consider
noverb:  a conclusive proof
active:  Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was twisted
active:  Do you not think
active:  he might have been trying to straighten it
active:  God bless you
active:  You are doing
active:  you can for him
noverb:  for me
active:  it is too heavy
noverb:  a task
active:  was he doing there at all
active:  his purpose were innocent
active:  did he not say
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And
active:  it were guilty
noverb:  ,
active:  did he not invent a lie
active:  His silence appears to me
active:  to cut
noverb:  ways
active:  There are several singular points about the case
active:  did the police think of the noise
active:  awoke you from your sleep
active:  They considered
passive: it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door
noverb:  A likely story
noverb:  As
passive: a man bent
active:  on felony would slam his door
active:  to wake a household
active:  did they say
noverb:  of the disappearance of these gems
active:  They are still sounding the planking
active:  probing the furniture in the hope
active:  finding them
noverb:  Have they thought
active:  looking outside the house
noverb:  Yes
active:  they have shown extraordinary energy
passive: The whole garden has already been minutely examined
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  said Holmes
active:  is it not obvious
noverb:  to you now
active:  this matter really strikes very much deeper
noverb:  you
active:  the police were at first inclined to think
novoice: It appeared to
noverb:  you
active:  to be a simple case
active:  to me it seems exceedingly complex
active:  Consider
passive: is involved by your theory
active:  You suppose
active:  your son came down from his bed
active:  went, at great risk, to your dressing-room
noverb:  opened your bureau
active:  took out your coronet
active:  broke off by main force a small portion of it
active:  went off to some other place
active:  concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine
noverb:  with such skill
active:  nobody can find them
novoice: returned with the other thirty-six into the room in
active:  he exposed himself to the greatest danger
passive: being discovered
active:  I ask you now
active:  is such a theory tenable
noverb:  other is there
active:  cried the banker with a gesture of despair
active:  his motives were innocent
active:  does he not explain them
active:  It is our task
active:  to find
noverb:  out
active:  replied Holmes
noverb:  now
noverb:  you
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  we will set off for Streatham together
active:  devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
active:  My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
active:  I was eager enough
active:  to do
passive: for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to
active:  we had listened
active:  I confess
active:  the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me
active:  to be
active:  it did to his unhappy father
active:  still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment
active:  I felt
active:  there must be some grounds
noverb:  for hope
passive: he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation
noverb:  He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb
active:  sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes
active:  sunk in the deepest thought
active:  Our client appeared
active:  to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
passive: had been presented to him
active:  he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs
noverb:  A short railway journey
active:  a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank
noverb:  the modest residence of the great financier
active:  Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone
noverb:  standing back a little from the road
noverb:  A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
noverb:  stretched down in front to two large iron gates
active:  closed the entrance
active:  On the right side was a small wooden thicket
active:  led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door
active:  forming the tradesmen's entrance
active:  On the left ran a lane
active:  led to the stables
active:  was not itself within the grounds at all
novoice: being a public
noverb:  little used
noverb:  thoroughfare
noverb:  Holmes left us standing at the door
active:  walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path
noverb:  round by the garden behind into the stable lane
active:  long was he
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I went into the dining-room
active:  waited by the fire
active:  he should return
active:  We were sitting there in silence
active:  the door opened
active:  a young lady came in
active:  She was rather above the middle height
noverb:  slim
noverb:  with dark hair
noverb:  eyes
active:  seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face
noverb:  Her lips
noverb:  too
active:  were bloodless
passive: her eyes were flushed with crying
noverb:  As she swept silently into the room
active:  she impressed me with a greater sense of grief
active:  the banker had done in the morning
active:  it was the
noverb:  more striking in her
active:  she was evidently a woman of strong character
noverb:  with immense capacity for self-restraint
active:  Disregarding my presence
active:  she went straight to her uncle
active:  passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
active:  You have given orders
passive: Arthur should be liberated
active:  have you not
noverb:  dad
active:  she asked
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  my girl
passive: the matter must be probed to the bottom
active:  I am so sure
noverb:  that he is innocent
active:  You know
active:  woman's instincts are
active:  I know
active:  he has done no harm
active:  you will be sorry
noverb:  for having acted
noverb:  harshly
active:  is he silent
active:  he is innocent
active:  knows
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  he was so angry
noverb:  that you should suspect him
active:  could I help
active:  suspecting him
active:  I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
noverb:  Oh
active:  he had only picked it up
active:  to look at it
noverb:  Oh
active:  do
active:  do take my word for it
active:  he is innocent
active:  Let the matter drop
active:  say no
active:  It is so dreadful
active:  to think of our dear Arthur in prison
active:  I shall never let
active:  it drop
passive: until the gems are found
noverb:  never
noverb:  Mary
active:  Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me
noverb:  Far
active:  hushing the thing up
active:  I have brought a gentleman down from London
active:  to inquire more deeply into it
noverb:  This gentleman
active:  she asked
noverb:  facing round to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  his friend
active:  He wished us
active:  to leave him alone
active:  He is round
noverb:  in the stable lane now
noverb:  The stable lane
noverb:  She raised her dark eyebrows
active:  can he hope to find there
noverb:  Ah! this
active:  I suppose
active:  is he
active:  I trust
noverb:  sir
active:  you will succeed in proving
active:  I feel sure
active:  is the truth
active:  my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime
active:  I fully share your opinion
active:  I trust
noverb:  with you
active:  we may prove it
active:  returned Holmes
noverb:  going back to the mat
active:  to knock the snow from his shoes
active:  I believe
active:  I have the honour
active:  addressing Miss Mary Holder
noverb:  Might I ask you a question or two
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  sir
active:  it may help to clear this horrible affair up
noverb:  You heard nothing yourself last night
noverb:  Nothing
active:  until my uncle here began to speak loudly
active:  I heard
active:  I came down
active:  You shut up the windows
noverb:  doors the night before
active:  Did you fasten all the windows
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Were they all fastened this morning
noverb:  Yes
active:  You have a maid
active:  has a sweetheart
active:  I think
active:  you remarked to your uncle last night
active:  she had been out
active:  to see him
noverb:  Yes
active:  she was the girl
noverb:  who waited in the drawing-room
active:  may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet
active:  I see
active:  You infer
active:  she may have gone out
active:  to tell her sweetheart
active:  the two may have planned the robbery
active:  is the good of all these vague theories
active:  cried the banker impatiently
active:  when I have told you
active:  I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands
active:  Wait a little, Mr. Holder
active:  We must come back to that
noverb:  About this girl
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  You saw her return by the kitchen door
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
active:  when I went
active:  to see
passive: the door was fastened for the night
active:  I met her slipping in
active:  I saw the man
noverb:  too
noverb:  in the gloom
active:  Do you know him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes!
active:  he is the green-grocer
active:  brings our vegetables round
active:  His name is Francis Prosper
active:  He stood
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  to the left of the door
active:  that is to say
noverb:  farther up the path
active:  is necessary
active:  to reach the door
noverb:  Yes
active:  he did
noverb:  And
active:  he is a man
noverb:  with a wooden leg
active:  Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes
active:  you are
noverb:  a magician
active:  said she
active:  do you know that
active:  She smiled
active:  there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin
noverb:  eager face
active:  I should be very glad now
active:  to go upstairs
active:  said he
active:  I shall probably wish
active:  to go over the
noverb:  of the house again
active:  Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows
active:  I go up
active:  He walked swiftly round from one to the other
active:  pausing only at the large one
active:  looked from the hall onto the stable lane
noverb:  This
active:  he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens
active:  Now we shall go upstairs
active:  said he at last
active:  The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber
noverb:  with a grey carpet
noverb:  a large bureau
noverb:  a long mirror
active:  Holmes went to the bureau first
active:  looked hard at the lock
passive: key was used
active:  to open it
active:  he asked
noverb:  my son
active:  himself indicated
noverb:  of the cupboard of the lumber-room
noverb:  Have you it here
active:  That is it on the dressing-table
active:  Sherlock Holmes took it up
active:  opened the bureau
active:  It is a noiseless lock
active:  said he
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that it did not wake you
noverb:  This case
active:  I presume
active:  contains the coronet
active:  We must have a look at it
active:  He opened the case
active:  taking out the diadem
active:  he laid it upon the table
active:  It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art
active:  the thirty-six stones were the finest
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
active:  a corner holding three gems
passive: had been torn away
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Holmes
active:  here is the corner
active:  corresponds to
novoice: has been
noverb:  unfortunately lost
active:  Might I beg
active:  you will break it off
active:  The banker recoiled in horror
active:  I should not dream of trying
active:  said he
active:  I will
active:  Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it
noverb:  without result
active:  I feel
active:  it give a little
active:  said he
active:  I am exceptionally strong
noverb:  in the fingers
noverb:  it would take me all my time
active:  to break it
active:  An ordinary man could not do it
noverb:  Now,
active:  do you
active:  think would happen
active:  I did break it, Mr. Holder
active:  There would be a noise
noverb:  like a pistol shot
active:  Do you tell me
noverb:  all this happened within a few yards of your bed
active:  you heard nothing of it
active:  I do not know
active:  to think
active:  It is all dark to me
active:  perhaps it may grow lighter
active:  we go
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  I confess
noverb:  I still share my uncle's perplexity
active:  Your son had no shoes or slippers on
active:  you saw him
noverb:  He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
active:  Thank you
passive: We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry
active:  it will be entirely our own fault
active:  we do not succeed
active:  clearing the matter up
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I shall
active:  now continue my investigations
active:  He went alone, at his own request, for he explained
active:  any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
noverb:  For an hour
active:  he was at work
active:  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features
active:  I think
active:  I have seen now all
active:  there is
active:  to see
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said he
noverb:  I can serve you best
active:  returning to my rooms
noverb:  the gems, Mr. Holmes
active:  Where are they
active:  I cannot tell
active:  The banker wrung his hands
active:  I shall never see them again
active:  he cried
noverb:  And my son
noverb:  You give me hopes
active:  My opinion is in no way altered
noverb:  , for God's sake,
active:  was this dark business
active:  was acted in my house last night
active:  you can call
active:  upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine
noverb:  ten
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to do
active:  I can to make it clearer
active:  I understand
active:  you give me carte blanche
active:  to act for
noverb:  you
novoice: provided only
active:  I get back the gems
active:  you place no limit on the sum
active:  I may draw
active:  I would give my fortune
noverb:  to have them back
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall look into the matter between this
noverb:  Good-bye;
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that I may have
active:  to come over here again
noverb:  evening
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  my companion's mind was
novoice: now made up about the case
active:  his conclusions were
active:  was more than
active:  I could even dimly imagine
noverb:  Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point
novoice: he always glided away to some other topic
noverb:  until at last I gave it over in despair
active:  It was not
noverb:  three
active:  we found ourselves in our rooms once
active:  He hurried to his chamber
novoice: was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
novoice: With his collar turned up
noverb:  his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots
active:  he was a perfect sample of the class
active:  I think
active:  this should do
active:  said he
active:  glancing into the glass above the fireplace
active:  I only wish
active:  you could come with me
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
noverb:  it won't do
active:  I may be on the trail in this matter
active:  I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp
active:  I shall soon know
active:  it is
active:  I hope
active:  I may be back
noverb:  in a few hours
active:  He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
active:  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread
active:  thrusting this rude meal into his pocket
active:  he started off upon his expedition
active:  I had just finished my tea
active:  he returned
noverb:  evidently in excellent spirits
active:  swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand
active:  He chucked it down into a corner
active:  helped himself to a cup of tea
novoice: I only looked in
active:  I passed
active:  said he
active:  I am going right on
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  to the other side of the West End
active:  It may be some time
active:  I get back
noverb:  Don't wait up for me in case
active:  I should be late
active:  are you getting on
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
active:  I have been out to Streatham
active:  I saw
active:  you last
active:  I did not call at the house
active:  It is a very sweet little problem
active:  I would not have missed it for a good deal
noverb:  However,
active:  I must not sit gossiping here
active:  must get these disreputable clothes off
noverb:  return to my highly respectable self
active:  I could see by his manner
active:  he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
active:  his words alone would imply
active:  His eyes twinkled
active:  there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks
active:  He hastened upstairs
noverb:  a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door
active:  told me
active:  he was off once
noverb:  upon his congenial hunt
active:  I waited until midnight
active:  there was no sign of his return
active:  I retired to my room
active:  It was no uncommon thing
noverb:  for him
active:  to be away for days
noverb:  nights on end
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon a scent
noverb:  his lateness caused me no surprise
active:  I do not know at
noverb:  hour he came in
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning there
active:  he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other
noverb:  as fresh
noverb:  trim as possible
active:  You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson
active:  said he
active:  you remember
active:  our client has rather an early appointment this morning
active:  it is after nine now
active:  I answered
passive: I should not be surprised
active:  were he
active:  I thought
active:  I heard a ring
active:  It was
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  our friend the financier
passive: I was shocked by the change
active:  had come over him
noverb:  for his face
active:  was naturally of a broad
noverb:  massive mould
active:  was now pinched
active:  fallen in
active:  his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter
active:  He entered with a weariness and lethargy
active:  was even more painful
noverb:  his violence of the morning before
active:  he dropped heavily into the armchair
active:  I pushed forward for him
active:  I do not know
active:  I have done to be
noverb:  severely tried
active:  said he
noverb:  Only two days ago
active:  I was a happy and prosperous man
noverb:  without a care in the world
passive: Now I am left to a lonely
active:  dishonoured age
active:  One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another
active:  My niece, Mary, has deserted me
active:  Deserted you
noverb:  Yes
passive: Her bed this morning had not been slept in
active:  her room was empty
noverb:  a note for me lay upon the hall table
active:  I had said to her last night
noverb:  in sorrow and not in anger
active:  she had married my boy all might
passive: have been well with him
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  it was thoughtless
noverb:  of me
active:  to say
active:  It is to
active:  remark
active:  she refers in this note
noverb:  MY DEAREST UNCLE
active:  I feel
active:  I have brought trouble upon you
active:  I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
active:  might never have occurred
active:  I cannot
noverb:  with this thought in my mind
active:  again be happy under your roof
active:  I feel
noverb:  I must leave you forever
active:  Do not worry about my future
noverb:  for
passive: is provided for
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  do not search for me
active:  for it will be fruitless labour
noverb:  an ill-service to me
noverb:  In life or in death
active:  I am
noverb:  your loving
noverb:  MARY
active:  could she mean by
noverb:  note
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Do you think
active:  it points to suicide
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  nothing of the kind
active:  It is perhaps the best possible solution
active:  I trust
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  you are nearing the end of your troubles
noverb:  Ha
active:  You say
active:  You have heard something
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have learned something
active:  Where are the gems
noverb:  You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them
active:  I would pay ten
active:  That would be unnecessary
active:  Three thousand will cover the matter
noverb:  And
active:  there is a little reward
active:  I fancy
active:  Have you your check-book? Here is a pen
noverb:  Better make it out for $4000
active:  With a dazed face the banker made out the required check
novoice: Holmes walked over to his desk
active:  took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it
active:  threw it down upon the table
active:  With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
active:  You have it
active:  he gasped
passive: I am saved
passive: I am saved
active:  The reaction of joy was
novoice: his grief had been
active:  he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
active:  There is one other thing
active:  you owe
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly
active:  Owe
active:  He caught up a pen
active:  Name the sum
active:  I will pay it
noverb:  No
active:  the debt is not to me
active:  You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son,
active:  has carried himself in this matter as
active:  I should be proud
active:  to see my own son
active:  do
active:  should I ever chance to have one
active:  it was not Arthur
noverb:  who took them
noverb:  I told you yesterday
noverb:  I repeat to-day
noverb:  ,
active:  it was not
active:  You are sure
noverb:  of it
noverb:  let us hurry to him at once
noverb:  to let him know
passive: the truth is known
active:  He knows it already
active:  When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him
active:  finding
noverb:  he would not tell me the story
active:  I told it to him
noverb:  on
active:  he had
active:  to confess
active:  I was right
noverb:  and
active:  to add the very few details
active:  were not
noverb:  quite clear to me
noverb:  Your news of this morning
noverb:  however
active:  may open his lips
noverb:  For heaven's sake
active:  tell me
active:  is this extraordinary mystery
active:  I will do
noverb:  I will show you the steps by
active:  I reached it
noverb:  And let me say to
noverb:  you
noverb:  first
active:  it is hardest
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
noverb:  for you
active:  to hear
active:  there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary
active:  They have
novoice: now fled together
noverb:  My Mary
noverb:  Impossible
active:  It is unfortunately more than possible
active:  it is certain
noverb:  Neither you
active:  your son knew the true character of this man
active:  you admitted him into your family circle
active:  He is one
noverb:  of the most dangerous men in England
noverb:  a ruined gambler
noverb:  an absolutely desperate villain

noverb:  At the same time
active:  he remarked after a pause
noverb:  during
active:  he had sat puffing at his long pipe

active:  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face

active:  It is a little fancy of my wife's
noverb:  ladies' fancies
active:  you know
noverb:  madam
passive: ladies' fancies must be consulted
noverb:  And
noverb:  you won't cut your hair
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I really could not
active:  I answered firmly
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  very well
noverb:  quite settles the matter
active:  It is a pity
active:  in other respects
active:  you would really have done very nicely
noverb:  In
noverb:  case
noverb:  Miss Stoper
active:  I had
active:  best inspect a few
noverb:  of your young ladies
active:  The manageress had sat all this
noverb:  busy with her papers without a word to
noverb:  of us
active:  she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face
active:  I could not help
active:  suspecting
active:  she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
active:  Do you desire your name
passive: to be kept upon the books
active:  she asked
noverb:  you
noverb:  Miss Stoper
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  it seems rather useless
active:  you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion
active:  said
noverb:  she sharply
active:  You can hardly expect us
active:  to exert ourselves
active:  to find another such opening for you
noverb:  Good-day to you, Miss Hunter
active:  She struck a gong upon the table
passive: I was shown out by the page
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got back to my lodgings
noverb:  found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table
active:  I began to ask myself
active:  I had not done a very foolish thing
noverb:  After all
active:  these people had strange fads
noverb:  expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters
active:  they were at least ready
active:  to pay for their eccentricity
active:  Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year
noverb:  Besides
active:  use was my hair to me
passive: Many people are improved
active:  wearing
active:  it short
active:  perhaps I should be among the number
noverb:  Next day I was inclined
active:  to think
active:  I had made a mistake
noverb:  by the day after
active:  I was sure
noverb:  of it
active:  I had almost overcome my pride
active:  to go back to the agency
active:  inquire
active:  the place was still open
noverb:  I received this letter from the gentleman himself
active:  I have it here
active:  I will read it to you
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  near Winchester
noverb:  DEAR MISS HUNTER
active:  Miss Stoper has very kindly
noverb:  given me your address
active:  I write from here
active:  to ask you
active:  you have reconsidered your decision
active:  My wife is very anxious
active:  you should come
noverb:  for she has been much
novoice: attracted by my description of you
active:  We are willing
active:  to give $30 a quarter
noverb:  $120 a year
active:  to recompense you for any little inconvenience
active:  our fads may cause you
active:  They are not very exacting
noverb:  , after all
active:  My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue
active:  would like you
active:  to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
active:  You need not
noverb:  however
active:  go to the expense
active:  purchasing one
active:  we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia)
active:  would
active:  I should think
novoice: fit you very well
noverb:  as to sitting here
noverb:  there
noverb:  amusing yourself in any manner indicated
noverb:  that need cause you no inconvenience
noverb:  As regards your hair
active:  it is no doubt
noverb:  a pity
noverb:  especially as I could not help
active:  remarking its beauty during our short interview
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must remain firm upon this point
active:  I only hope
active:  the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
noverb:  Your duties
passive: the child is concerned
active:  are very light
active:  Now do try to come
active:  I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester
noverb:  Let me know your train
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  JEPHRO RUCASTLE
active:  That is the letter
active:  I have just received
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: my mind is made up
active:  I will accept it
active:  I thought
noverb:  however
active:  taking the final step
active:  I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Miss Hunter
passive: your mind is made up
active:  that settles the question
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  you would not advise me
active:  to refuse
active:  I confess
active:  it is not the situation
noverb:  which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
active:  is the meaning of it all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Ah
active:  I have no data
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
noverb:  Well,
active:  there seems to me
active:  to be only one possible solution
active:  Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to be a very kind, good-natured man
active:  Is it not possible
noverb:  that his wife is a lunatic
active:  he desires to keep the matter
active:  quiet for fear
passive: she should be taken to an asylum
active:  he humours her fancies in every way in order
active:  to prevent an outbreak
active:  That is a possible solution
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  as matters stand
active:  it is the most probable one
active:  in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
noverb:  the money, Mr. Holmes, the money
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
active:  of course the pay is good
noverb:  too good
active:  That is
active:  makes me uneasy
noverb:  should they give you $120 a year
active:  they could have their pick for $40
active:  There must be some strong reason behind
active:  I thought
noverb:  I told you the circumstances
active:  you would understand afterwards
active:  I wanted your help
active:  I should feel so much stronger
active:  I felt
active:  you were at the back of me
noverb:  Oh
active:  you may carry that feeling away with you
active:  I assure you
active:  your little problem promises to be the most interesting
active:  has come my way for some months
active:  There is something
noverb:  distinctly novel about some of the features
active:  you should find yourself in doubt
noverb:  in danger
noverb:  Danger
noverb:  danger do you foresee
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  It would cease to be a danger
active:  we could define it
active:  said he
noverb:  at any time, day or night
active:  a telegram would bring me down to your help
active:  That is enough
active:  She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
active:  I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now
active:  I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once
noverb:  sacrifice my poor hair to-night
noverb:  start for Winchester to-morrow
active:  With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
noverb:  good-night
novoice: bustled off upon her way
noverb:  At least
active:  said I
active:  we heard her quick
noverb:  firm steps descending the stairs
active:  she seems to be a young lady
noverb:  who is very well able
active:  to take care of herself
active:  And she would need
active:  to be
active:  said Holmes gravely
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  we do not hear from her
active:  many days are past
active:  It was not very long
noverb:  before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
active:  A fortnight went by
noverb:  during
active:  I frequently found
active:  my thoughts turning in her direction
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
noverb:  The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a fad
noverb:  a plot
active:  the man were a philanthropist or a villain
active:  it was quite beyond my powers
active:  to determine
noverb:  As to Holmes
active:  I observed
active:  he sat frequently for half an hour on end
noverb:  with knitted brows
noverb:  an abstracted air
active:  he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand
active:  I mentioned it
noverb:  Data! data! data
active:  he cried impatiently
noverb:  I can't make bricks without clay
noverb:  And
active:  he would always wind up
active:  muttering
noverb:  no sister of his should ever
active:  have accepted such a situation
noverb:  The telegram
active:  we eventually received
active:  came late one night just
active:  I was thinking
active:  turning in
active:  Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches
novoice: he frequently indulged in
active:  I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night
active:  find him in the same position
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning
active:  He opened the yellow envelope
active:  glancing at the message
active:  threw it across to me
active:  Just look up the trains in Bradshaw
active:  said he
noverb:  turned back to his chemical studies
active:  The summons was a brief
noverb:  urgent one
active:  be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow
active:  it said
active:  Do come
active:  I am at my wit's end
noverb:  HUNTER
active:  Will you come with me
active:  asked Holmes
active:  glancing up
active:  I should wish to
noverb:  Just look it up
active:  There is a train
noverb:  at half-past nine
active:  said I
active:  glancing over my Bradshaw
active:  It is due
noverb:  at Winchester at 11
noverb:  30
active:  That will do very nicely
active:  perhaps I had
active:  better postpone my analysis of the acetones
noverb:  as we may need
active:  to be at our best in the morning
noverb:  By eleven o'clock the next day
active:  we were well upon our way to the old English capital
active:  Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down
noverb:  after we had passed the Hampshire border
active:  he threw them down
active:  began to admire the scenery
noverb:  It was an ideal spring day
noverb:  a light blue sky
passive: flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east
active:  The sun was shining very brightly
active:  there was an exhilarating nip in the air
novoice: set an edge to a man's energy
noverb:  All over the countryside
noverb:  away to the rolling hills around Aldershot
novoice: the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
active:  Are they not fresh
noverb:  beautiful
active:  I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  it is one
noverb:  of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine
active:  I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject
active:  You look at these scattered houses
passive: you are impressed by their beauty
active:  I look at them
noverb:  the only thought
active:  comes
active:  to me is a feeling of their isolation
noverb:  and of the impunity with
passive: crime may be committed there
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
active:  They always fill me with a certain horror
active:  It is my belief, Watson
passive: founded upon my experience
active:  the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
active:  does the smiling and beautiful countryside
active:  You horrify me
active:  the reason is very obvious
active:  The pressure of public opinion can do in the town
active:  the law cannot accomplish
active:  There is no lane
noverb:  so vile
noverb:  the scream of a tortured child
noverb:  the thud of a drunkard's blow
active:  does not beget sympathy
noverb:  indignation among the neighbours
active:  the whole machinery of justice is
noverb:  close
noverb:  a word of complaint can set it going
active:  there is
noverb:  a step between the crime and the dock
active:  look at these lonely houses
noverb:  each in its own fields
passive: filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk
active:  know little of the law
noverb:  Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty
noverb:  the hidden wickedness
active:  may go on
noverb:  year in
noverb:  year out, in such places, and none the wiser
active:  Had this lady
active:  appeals
active:  to us for help gone
active:  to live in Winchester
active:  I should never have had a fear for her
active:  It is the five miles of country
noverb:  which makes the danger
noverb:  Still,
active:  it is clear
noverb:  that she is not personally threatened
noverb:  No
active:  she can come to Winchester
active:  to meet us
active:  she can get away
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  She has her freedom
active:  can be the matter
active:  Can you suggest no explanation
active:  I have devised seven separate explanations
noverb:  each of
active:  would cover the facts
active:  we know them
noverb:  of these is correct
passive: can only be determined by the fresh information
active:  we shall no doubt find waiting for us
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is the tower of the cathedral
active:  we shall soon learn all
active:  Miss Hunter has
active:  to tell
active:  The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street
noverb:  at no distance from the station
noverb:  there
active:  we found the young lady waiting for us
active:  She had engaged a sitting-room
active:  our lunch awaited us upon the table
active:  I am so delighted
noverb:  that you have come
active:  she said earnestly
active:  It is
noverb:  very kind of you
active:  indeed I do not know
active:  I should do
active:  Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
active:  Pray
active:  tell us
active:  has happened to
noverb:  you
active:  I will do
active:  I must be quick
noverb:  , for I have promised Mr. Rucastle
active:  to be back
noverb:  three
active:  I got his leave
active:  to come into town this morning
active:  he little knew for
noverb:  purpose
noverb:  Let us have everything in its due order
noverb:  Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire
active:  composed himself
active:  to listen
noverb:  In the first place
active:  I may say
active:  I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
active:  It is only fair
noverb:  to them
active:  to say that
active:  But I cannot understand them
active:  I am not easy
noverb:  in my mind about them
active:  can you not understand
noverb:  Their reasons for their conduct
active:  you shall have it all just
active:  it occurred
active:  When I came down
novoice: Mr. Rucastle met me here
active:  drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches
active:  It is
noverb:  as he said
noverb:  beautifully situated
active:  it is not beautiful
noverb:  in itself
active:  for it is a large square block of a house
noverb:  whitewashed
noverb:  all stained
novoice: streaked with damp
noverb:  bad weather
novoice: There are grounds round it
noverb:  woods on three sides
noverb:  on the fourth a field
active:  slopes down to the Southampton highroad
passive: curves past about a hundred yards from the front door
noverb:  This ground in front belongs to the house
noverb:  the woods all round
active:  are part of Lord Southerton's preserves
active:  A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
passive: I was driven over by my employer
active:  was
passive: was introduced by him
active:  evening to his wife and the child
active:  There was no truth
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  in the conjecture
active:  seemed to us
active:  to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street
active:  Mrs. Rucastle is not mad
active:  I found her
active:  to be a silent, pale-faced woman
noverb:  much younger
noverb:  her husband
noverb:  not more than thirty
active:  I should think
active:  he can hardly be less than forty-five
active:  From their conversation I have gathered
active:  they have been married about seven years
active:  he was a widower
active:  his only child by the first wife was the daughter
active:  has gone to Philadelphia
active:  Mr. Rucastle told me in private
noverb:  the reason
active:  she had left
active:  them was
active:  she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother
active:  As the daughter could not have been less than twenty
active:  I can quite imagine
active:  her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife
active:  Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me
active:  to be colourless in mind
noverb:  in feature
active:  She impressed me
noverb:  favourably
noverb:  the reverse
active:  She was a nonentity
active:  It was easy
active:  to see
passive: she was passionately devoted
noverb:  to her husband
noverb:  to her little son
noverb:  Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other
active:  noting every little want
active:  forestalling it
noverb:  possible
active:  He was kind
noverb:  to her also in his bluff
noverb:  boisterous fashion
noverb:  on the whole
active:  they seemed to be a happy couple
noverb:  And
active:  she had some secret sorrow
noverb:  this woman
passive: She would often be lost in deep thought
noverb:  with the saddest look upon her face
active:  More than once I have surprised her in tears
active:  I have thought sometimes
active:  it was the disposition of her child
active:  weighed upon her mind
noverb:  for I have never met
noverb:  utterly spoiled
noverb:  so ill-natured a little creature
active:  He is small
noverb:  for his age
noverb:  with a head
active:  is quite disproportionately large
active:  His whole life appears
passive: to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals
active:  sulking
noverb:  Giving pain to any creature weaker
active:  himself seems to be his one idea of amusement
active:  he shows quite remarkable talent
active:  planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects
active:  But I would rather not talk about the creature
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  indeed
active:  he has little
active:  to do with my story
active:  I am glad
noverb:  of all details
active:  remarked my friend
active:  they seem to
noverb:  you
active:  to be relevant
noverb:  not
active:  I shall try not
active:  to miss anything of importance
noverb:  The one unpleasant thing about the house
active:  struck me at once
active:  was the appearance and conduct of the servants
active:  There are only two
noverb:  , a man and his wife
noverb:  Toller
noverb:  for
active:  is his name
active:  is a rough, uncouth man
noverb:  with grizzled hair and whiskers
noverb:  a perpetual smell of drink
noverb:  Twice
active:  I have been with them
active:  he has been quite drunk
novoice: Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to take no notice of it
active:  His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  much less amiable
active:  They are a most unpleasant couple
active:  fortunately I spend
noverb:  of my time in the nursery
noverb:  my own room
active:  are next to each other in one corner of the building
active:  For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet
noverb:  on the third
active:  Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  turning to me
active:  we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter,
active:  falling in with our whims
active:  to cut your hair
active:  I assure you
active:  it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance
active:  We shall now see
active:  the electric-blue dress will become you
active:  You will find
active:  it laid out upon the bed in your room
active:  you would be so good
noverb:  as
active:  to put it on we should
active:  be extremely obliged
noverb:  The dress
active:  I found
noverb:  waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue
active:  It was of excellent material
noverb:  a sort of beige
active:  it bore unmistakable signs
passive: having been worn before
active:  It could not have been a better fit
passive: I had been measured for
noverb:  it
noverb:  Both Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it
active:  seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence
active:  They were waiting for me in the drawing-room
active:  is a very large room
noverb:  stretching along the entire front of the house
active:  with three long windows reaching down to the floor
active:  A chair had been placed close to the central window
novoice: with its back turned towards
noverb:  it
passive: In this I was asked
active:  to sit
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
novoice: walking up and down on the other side of the room
noverb:  began to tell me a series of the funniest stories
active:  I have ever listened to
active:  You cannot imagine
noverb:  comical he was
active:  I laughed
active:  I was quite weary
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  however
active:  has evidently no sense of humour
noverb:  never
novoice: smiled
noverb:  sat with her hands in her lap
noverb:  a sad, anxious look upon her face
noverb:  After an hour
active:  Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked
active:  it was time
active:  to commence the duties of the day
active:  I might change my dress
active:  go to little Edward in the nursery
noverb:  Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances
active:  Again I changed my dress
active:  again I sat in the window
active:  again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of
active:  my employer had an immense repertoire
active:  he told inimitably
noverb:  he handed me a yellow-backed novel
active:  moving my chair a little sideways
active:  my own shadow might not fall upon the page
active:  he begged me
active:  to read aloud to him
active:  I read for about ten minutes
noverb:  beginning in the heart of a chapter
active:  suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me
active:  to cease
active:  to change my dress
active:  You can easily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  curious I became as to
active:  the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be
active:  They were always very careful
active:  I observed
active:  to turn my face away from the window
active:  I became consumed with the desire
active:  to see
active:  was going on behind my back
noverb:  At first it seemed
active:  to be impossible
active:  I soon devised a means
noverb:  My hand-mirror had been broken
active:  a happy thought seized me
active:  I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief
noverb:  On the next occasion
noverb:  in the midst of my laughter
active:  I put my handkerchief up to my eyes
active:  was able with a little management
active:  to see all
active:  there was behind me
active:  I confess
passive: I was disappointed
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  At least
active:  was my first impression
noverb:  At the second glance
noverb:  however
active:  I perceived
active:  there was a man standing in the Southampton Road
active:  a small bearded man in a grey suit
active:  seemed
active:  to be looking in my direction
active:  The road is an important highway
novoice: there are usually people there
noverb:  This man
noverb:  however
active:  was leaning against the railings
active:  bordered our field
active:  was looking earnestly up
active:  I lowered my handkerchief
active:  glanced at Mrs. Rucastle
active:  to find
active:  her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze
active:  She said nothing
passive: I am convinced
active:  she had divined
active:  I had a mirror in my hand
active:  had seen
active:  was behind me
active:  She rose at once
noverb:  Jephro
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there
noverb:  stares up at Miss Hunter
noverb:  No friend of yours
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  he asked
noverb:  No
active:  I know no one in these parts
noverb:  Dear me
noverb:  very impertinent
noverb:  Kindly turn round
noverb:  motion to him
active:  to go away
noverb:  Surely
active:  it would be better
active:  to take no notice
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  we should have him loitering here always
noverb:  Kindly turn round
active:  wave him away
noverb:  that
active:  I did
passive: I was told
active:  at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind
active:  That was a week ago
noverb:  from
active:  time
active:  I have not sat again in the window
noverb:  have I worn the blue dress
active:  seen the man in the road
active:  Pray
active:  continue
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Your narrative promises
active:  to be a most interesting one
active:  You will find it rather disconnected
active:  I fear
active:  there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
active:  I speak
noverb:  On the very first day
active:  I was at the Copper Beeches
active:  Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse
noverb:  stands near the kitchen door
active:  we approached it
active:  I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
noverb:  the sound as of a large animal moving about
noverb:  Look in here
active:  said Mr. Rucastle
noverb:  showing me a slit between two planks
noverb:  Is he not a beauty
active:  I looked through
active:  was conscious of two glowing eyes
novoice: of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
passive: Don't be frightened
active:  said
noverb:  my employer
active:  laughing at the start
active:  I had given
active:  It's only Carlo
noverb:  my mastiff
active:  I call him mine
noverb:  really old Toller
noverb:  my groom
active:  is the only man
active:  can do anything with him
noverb:  We feed him once a day
noverb:  not too much
active:  he is always
noverb:  mustard
noverb:  Toller lets him loose every night
active:  God help the trespasser
active:  he lays his fangs upon
noverb:  For goodness' sake don't you
novoice: on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night
noverb:  for it's
active:  your life is worth
noverb:  The warning was no idle one
active:  for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
active:  It was a beautiful moonlight night
passive: the lawn in front of the house was silvered over
noverb:  almost
noverb:  day
active:  I was standing
noverb:  rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene
active:  I was aware
active:  that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches
active:  it emerged into the moonshine
active:  I saw
active:  it was
active:  It was a giant dog
noverb:  a calf
noverb:  tawny tinted
noverb:  with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones
active:  It walked slowly across the lawn
novoice: vanished into the shadow upon the other side
active:  dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
active:  I do not think
active:  any burglar could have done
active:  And now I have a very strange experience
active:  to tell you
active:  I had
active:  you know
active:  cut off my hair in London
active:  I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk
noverb:  One evening
active:  after the child was in bed
active:  I began to amuse myself
active:  examining the furniture of my room
active:  rearranging my own little things
active:  There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open
noverb:  the lower one locked
noverb:  I had filled the first two with my linen
active:  I had still much
noverb:  to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
active:  It struck me
passive: it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
active:  I took out my bunch of keys
active:  tried
active:  to open it
active:  The very first key fitted to perfection
active:  I drew the drawer open
active:  There was only one thing in it
active:  I am sure
active:  you would never guess
active:  it was
active:  It was my coil of hair
active:  I took it up
active:  examined it
active:  It was of the same peculiar tint
noverb:  the same thickness
active:  the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me
active:  could my hair
passive: have been locked in the drawer
active:  With trembling hands I undid my trunk
passive: turned out the contents
active:  drew from the bottom my own hair
active:  I laid the two tresses together
active:  I assure you
active:  they were identical
active:  Was it not extraordinary
noverb:  Puzzle as I would
active:  I could make nothing at all of
novoice: it meant
active:  I returned the strange hair to the drawer
active:  I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt
active:  I had put myself in the wrong
active:  opening a drawer
active:  they had locked
active:  I am naturally observant
noverb:  , as you may have remarked
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
active:  There was one wing
noverb:  however
active:  appeared not
passive: to be inhabited at all
noverb:  A door
active:  faced
novoice: led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite
passive: it was invariably locked
noverb:  One day
noverb:  however
active:  I ascended the stair
active:  I met Mr. Rucastle
active:  coming out through this door
noverb:  his keys in his hand
noverb:  a look on his face
noverb:  made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to
passive: I was accustomed
active:  His cheeks were red
active:  his brow was all crinkled with anger
active:  the veins stood out at his temples with passion
active:  He locked the door
active:  hurried past me without a word or a look
noverb:  This aroused my curiosity
active:  I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge
active:  I strolled round to the side from
active:  I could see the windows of this part of the house
active:  There were four of them
noverb:  in a row
noverb:  three of
active:  were simply dirty
passive: the fourth was shuttered up
active:  They were evidently all
noverb:  deserted
novoice: As I strolled up and down
active:  glancing at them occasionally
active:  Mr. Rucastle came out to me
noverb:  looking as merry
noverb:  jovial as
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you must not think me rude
active:  I passed you without a word, my dear young lady
passive: I was preoccupied with business matters
active:  I assured him
passive: I was not offended
noverb:  By the way
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there
active:  one of them has the shutters up
active:  He looked surprised
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  a little startled at my remark
active:  Photography is one of my hobbies
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I have made my dark room up there
noverb:  dear me!
noverb:  an observant young lady
active:  we have come upon
active:  would have believed it
active:  would have ever believed it
active:  He spoke in a jesting tone
active:  there was no jest
noverb:  in his eyes
active:  he looked at me
noverb:  I read suspicion there
noverb:  annoyance
noverb:  no jest
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  from the moment
active:  I understood
active:  there was something
noverb:  about that suite of rooms
active:  I was not to know
novoice: I was all
noverb:  on fire
active:  to go over them
active:  It was not mere curiosity
active:  I have my share of that
active:  It was more
noverb:  a feeling of duty
noverb:  a feeling
active:  some good might come from my penetrating to this place
noverb:  They talk of woman's instinct
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it was woman's instinct
active:  gave me
noverb:  feeling
noverb:  At any rate
active:  it was there
noverb:  ,
active:  I was keenly on the lookout for any chance
active:  to pass the forbidden door
active:  It was only yesterday
active:  the chance came
active:  I may tell you
noverb:  , besides Mr. Rucastle,
noverb:  Toller
active:  his wife find something
active:  to do in these deserted rooms
noverb:  I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door
active:  Recently he has been drinking hard
noverb:  yesterday evening
active:  he was very drunk
active:  and when I came upstairs
active:  there was the key in the door
active:  I have no doubt at all
noverb:  he had left it there
noverb:  Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle were
noverb:  downstairs
active:  the child was with them
active:  I had an admirable opportunity
active:  I turned the key gently in the lock
active:  opened the door
novoice: slipped through
active:  There was a little passage in front of me
noverb:  unpapered
noverb:  uncarpeted
active:  turned at a right angle at the farther end
active:  Round
active:  this corner were three doors in a line
noverb:  the first
noverb:  third of
active:  were open
noverb:  They each led into an empty room
noverb:  dusty
noverb:  cheerless
noverb:  with two windows in the one and one in the other
noverb:  thick with dirt
active:  the evening light glimmered dimly through them
passive: The centre door was closed
noverb:  across the
noverb:  of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed
novoice: padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall
novoice: fastened at the other with stout cord
noverb:  The door
passive: itself was locked as well
active:  the key was not there
active:  This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window
active:  I could see by the glimmer from beneath it
active:  the room was not in darkness
noverb:  Evidently
active:  there was a skylight
noverb:  which let in light from above
active:  As I stood
active:  in the passage gazing at the sinister door
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  secret it might veil
novoice: I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
active:  saw a shadow pass backward
noverb:  forward against the little slit of dim light
novoice: shone out from under the door
active:  A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes
active:  My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly
active:  I turned and ran
active:  ran as
active:  some dreadful hand were
active:  behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress
active:  I rushed down the passage, through the door,
noverb:  straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle
active:  was waiting
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  smiling
active:  it was you
active:  I thought
active:  it must be
active:  I saw the door
active:  open
noverb:  Oh
active:  I am so frightened
active:  I panted
noverb:  My dear young lady! my dear young lady
active:  you cannot think
noverb:  caressing
active:  soothing
active:  his manner was
active:  has frightened you, my dear young lady
active:  his voice was just a little too coaxing
active:  He overdid it
active:  I was keenly on my guard against him
active:  I was foolish enough
active:  to go into the empty wing
active:  I answered
active:  it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light
passive: I was frightened and ran out again
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is
noverb:  dreadfully still in there
noverb:  Only that
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  looking at me keenly
noverb:  did you think
active:  I asked
active:  do you think
active:  I lock this door
active:  I am sure
active:  I do not know
active:  It is to keep people out
noverb:  have no business there
noverb:  Do you see
active:  He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
active:  I am sure
active:  I had known
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know now
noverb:  And
noverb:  you
novoice: put your foot over that threshold again
noverb:  here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage
active:  he glared down at me with the face of a demon
active:  I'll throw you to the mastiff
active:  I was so terrified
noverb:  that I do not know
active:  I did
active:  I suppose
active:  I must have rushed past him into my room
active:  I remember nothing
active:  I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
noverb:  Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I could not live there longer without some advice
passive: I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child
active:  They were all horrible to me
active:  If I could only bring you down all would be well
noverb:  Of course I might have fled from the house
active:  my curiosity was almost
noverb:  my fears
passive: My mind was soon made up
noverb:  I would send you a wire
active:  I put on my hat
noverb:  cloak
active:  went down to the office
active:  is about half a mile from the house
novoice: returned
noverb:  feeling very much easier
active:  A horrible doubt came into my mind
active:  I approached the door
active:  the dog might be loose
active:  I remembered
active:  Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility
noverb:  evening
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was the only one in the household
active:  had any influence with the savage creature
noverb:  would venture to set him free
active:  I slipped in in safety
noverb:  lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought
active:  seeing you
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  getting leave
active:  to come into Winchester this morning
active:  I must be back
noverb:  before three o'clock
active:  for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit
active:  will be away all the evening
active:  I must look after the child
active:  Now I have told you
active:  all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad
active:  you could tell me
noverb:  it all means
noverb:  above all
active:  I should do
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
noverb:  My friend rose now
novoice: paced up and down the room
noverb:  his hands in his pockets
noverb:  an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
noverb:  Is Toller still drunk
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
active:  I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle
active:  she could do nothing with him
active:  That is well
active:  And the Rucastles go out to-night?
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Is there a cellar with a good strong lock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  the wine-cellar
active:  You seem to me
active:  to have acted all through this matter
noverb:  a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter
active:  Do you think
active:  you could perform one more feat
active:  I should not ask it of you
noverb:  I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
active:  I will try
active:  is it
active:  We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock
noverb:  my friend
passive: I. The Rucastles will be gone by
noverb:  time
active:  Toller will
active:  we hope
active:  be incapable
active:  There only remains Mrs. Toller
active:  might give the alarm
active:  you could send her into the cellar on some errand
noverb:  turn the key upon her
active:  you would facilitate matters immensely
active:  I will do it
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We shall
noverb:  look thoroughly into the affair
noverb:  Of course
active:  there is only one feasible explanation
active:  You have been brought there
active:  to personate someone
passive: the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
active:  That is obvious
noverb:  As to
active:  this prisoner is
active:  I have no doubt
active:  it is the daughter
noverb:  Miss Alice Rucastle
active:  I remember right
passive: was said
active:  to have gone to America
passive: You were chosen
noverb:  doubtless
active:  resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair
passive: Hers had been cut off
noverb:  very possibly in some illness through
active:  she has passed
active:  , of course, yours had to be sacrificed also
active:  By a curious chance
active:  you came upon her tresses
active:  The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--
noverb:  no doubt
active:  you wore the girl's dress
active:  were
noverb:  her
passive: he was convinced from your laughter
active:  he saw you
noverb:  afterwards from your gesture
active:  Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
active:  she no longer desired his attentions
passive: The dog is let loose at night
active:  to prevent him
active:  endeavouring
active:  to communicate with her
active:  much is fairly clear
active:  The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
active:  on earth has
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  My dear Watson
noverb:  you
active:  a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
noverb:  Don't you see
active:  the converse is equally valid
active:  I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents
active:  studying their children
active:  This child's disposition is abnormally cruel
noverb:  merely for cruelty's sake
active:  he derives this from his smiling father
noverb:  as I should suspect
noverb:  from his mother
active:  it bodes evil for the poor girl
active:  is in their power
active:  I am sure
active:  you are right
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  cried our client
active:  A thousand things come back to me
active:  make me certain
active:  you have hit it
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
active:  We must be circumspect
noverb:  , for we are dealing with a very cunning man
active:  We can do nothing until seven o'clock
active:  At that hour we shall be with
noverb:  you
active:  it will not be long
active:  we solve the mystery
active:  We were
noverb:  our word
active:  for it was just seven
noverb:  when we reached the Copper Beeches
active:  having put up our trap at a wayside public-house
noverb:  The group of trees
noverb:  with their dark leaves shining
noverb:  burnished metal in the light of the setting sun
active:  were sufficient
active:  to mark the house even
active:  had Miss Hunter not
active:  been standing smiling on the door-step
active:  Have you managed it
active:  asked Holmes
active:  A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
active:  That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar
active:  said she
noverb:  Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
active:  Here are his keys
active:  are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's
active:  You have done well indeed
active:  cried Holmes with enthusiasm
active:  Now lead the way
active:  we shall soon see the end of this black business
active:  We passed up the stair
active:  unlocked the door
novoice: followed on down a passage
active:  found ourselves in front of the barricade
active:  Miss Hunter had described
active:  Holmes cut the cord
active:  removed the transverse bar
active:  he tried the various keys in the lock
noverb:  without success
active:  No sound came from within
novoice: at the silence Holmes' face clouded over
active:  I trust
active:  we are not too late
active:  said he
active:  I think
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  we had
active:  better go in without you
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  put your shoulder to it
active:  we shall see
active:  we cannot make our way in
noverb:  It was an old rickety door
active:  gave at once
noverb:  our united strength
active:  Together we rushed into the room
active:  It was empty
active:  There was no
active:  furniture save a little pallet bed
noverb:  a small table
noverb:  a basketful of linen
noverb:  The skylight
active:  was open
active:  the prisoner gone
active:  There has been some villainy here
active:  said Holmes
active:  this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions
active:  has carried his victim off
noverb:  Through the skylight
active:  We shall soon see
active:  he managed it
active:  He swung himself up onto the roof
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  he cried
noverb:  here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
active:  That is
active:  he did it
active:  it is impossible
active:  said Miss Hunter
active:  the ladder was not there
active:  the Rucastles went away
active:  He has come back
active:  done it
active:  I tell you
active:  he is a clever and dangerous man
active:  I should not be very much surprised
active:  this were he
noverb:  step I hear now upon the stair
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  it would be as well for
noverb:  you
active:  to have your pistol
active:  ready
active:  The words were hardly out of his mouth
active:  a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand
novoice: Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang forward
active:  confronted him
noverb:  You villain
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  where's your daughter
noverb:  The fat man cast his eyes round
noverb:  up at the open skylight
active:  It is for me
noverb:  to ask you that
active:  he shrieked
active:  you thieves
noverb:  Spies
noverb:  thieves
active:  I have caught you
active:  have I
active:  You are in my power
active:  I'll serve you
active:  He turned and clattered down the stairs
active:  he could go
active:  He's gone for the dog
active:  cried Miss Hunter
active:  I have my revolver
active:  said I.
noverb:  Better close the front door
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  we all rushed down the stairs together
active:  We had hardly reached the hall
active:  we heard the baying of a hound
noverb:  a scream of agony
noverb:  with a horrible worrying sound
active:  it was dreadful
active:  to listen to
noverb:  An elderly man with a red face
active:  shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
noverb:  My God
active:  he cried
active:  Someone has loosed the dog
active:  It's
passive: not been fed for two days
noverb:  Quick,
noverb:  quick
active:  it'll be too late
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  round the angle of the house
noverb:  with Toller hurrying behind us
active:  There was the huge famished brute
novoice: its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat
active:  he writhed and screamed upon the ground
active:  Running up
active:  I blew its brains out
noverb:  it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
active:  With much labour we separated them
active:  carried him
noverb:  living
noverb:  horribly mangled
noverb:  into the house
active:  We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa
active:  having dispatched the sobered Toller
active:  to bear the news to his wife
active:  I did
active:  I could to relieve his pain
active:  We were all assembled
active:  round him
active:  the door opened
active:  a tall, gaunt woman entered the room
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  cried Miss Hunter
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  miss
active:  Mr. Rucastle let me out
active:  he came back
active:  he went up to you
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  miss
noverb:  it is a pity you didn't let me know
active:  you were planning
noverb:  for I would have told you
active:  your pains
passive: were wasted
noverb:  Ha
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  looking keenly at her
active:  It is clear
active:  that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter
noverb:  anyone else
active:  Yes, sir, I do
active:  I am ready enough
active:  to tell
active:  I know
active:  pray
active:  sit down
noverb:  let us hear
active:  it for there are several points on
active:  I must confess
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I will soon make it clear
noverb:  to you
active:  said she
active:  and I'd have done
noverb:  now
noverb:  I could ha' got out from the cellar
active:  there's police-court business over this
active:  you'll remember
active:  I was the
noverb:  one
active:  stood your friend
active:  I was Miss Alice's friend too
active:  She was never happy
noverb:  at home
noverb:  Miss Alice wasn't
noverb:  from the time
noverb:  her father married again
passive: She was slighted
active:  had no say in anything
active:  it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house
active:  I could learn
active:  Miss Alice had rights of her own
active:  will
active:  she was so quiet and patient
active:  she was
active:  she never said
noverb:  a word about them
active:  just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands
active:  He knew
active:  he was safe
noverb:  with her
active:  there was a chance of a husband coming forward
active:  would ask for all
active:  the law would give him
novoice: her father thought it time
active:  to put a stop on it
active:  He wanted her
active:  to sign a paper
active:  she married
noverb:  not
noverb:  he could use her money
noverb:  When she wouldn't do it
active:  he kept
active:  worrying her
active:  she got brain-fever
active:  for six weeks was at death's door
active:  she got better at last
noverb:  all worn to a shadow
active:  with her beautiful hair cut off
noverb:  didn't make no change in her young man
active:  he stuck to her
active:  man could be
noverb:  Ah
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  you have been good enough
noverb:  to tell us makes the matter fairly clear
noverb:  ,
active:  I can deduce all
noverb:  remains
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
active:  I presume
active:  took to this system of imprisonment
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order
active:  to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler
active:  That was it, sir
active:  Mr. Fowler being a persevering man
active:  as a good seaman should be
active:  blockaded the house
active:  having met
active:  you succeeded by certain arguments
noverb:  metallic
active:  convincing you
active:  your interests
active:  were the same as his
active:  Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman
active:  said Mrs. Toller serenely
noverb:  And in this way
active:  he managed
active:  your good man should have no want of drink
active:  a ladder should be ready at the moment
active:  your master had gone out
active:  You have it
noverb:  sir
noverb:  just
active:  it happened
active:  I am sure
noverb:  we owe you an apology
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  for you have certainly cleared up everything
active:  puzzled us
active:  And here comes the country surgeon
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
active:  it seems to me
noverb:  our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
noverb:  And
active:  was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
active:  Mr. Rucastle survived
active:  was always a broken man
active:  kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife
active:  They still live with their old servants
active:  probably know
noverb:  much of Rucastle's past life
active:  he finds it difficult
active:  to part from them
noverb:  Mr. Fowler
passive: Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight
active:  he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius
noverb:  As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes
noverb:  rather to my disappointment
active:  manifested no further interest in her
active:  once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems
active:  she is now the head of a private school at Walsall
active:  I believe
active:  she has met with considerable success

noverb:  PREFACE
noverb:  As things now stand
noverb:  the course of instruction in American history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
passive: Three separate books are used
noverb:  First,
active:  there is the primary book
active:  is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes
noverb:  Second
active:  there is the advanced text for the seventh
noverb:  eighth grade
noverb:  generally speaking
noverb:  an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words
noverb:  Finally,
active:  there is the
noverb:  high school manual
noverb:  This
noverb:  too
active:  ordinarily follows the beaten path
noverb:  giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters
active:  To put it bluntly
active:  we do not assume
active:  our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades
active:  mathematicians followed the same method
noverb:  high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions
active:  There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism
novoice: advanced above
active:  It is
active:  teachers have learned from bitter experience
noverb:  little history their pupils retain as
noverb:  they pass along the regular route
active:  No teacher of history will deny this
noverb:  Still
active:  it is a standing challenge
active:  to existing methods of historical instruction
active:  the study of history cannot be made truly progressive
noverb:  the study of mathematics, science, and languages
active:  the historians assume a grave responsibility
active:  adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum
active:  the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text
noverb:  more facts
noverb:  dates
noverb:  words
active:  history deserves
noverb:  of the sharp criticism
active:  it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and economics
active:  In this condition of affairs we find our justification
active:  offering a new high school text in American history
active:  Our first contribution is one of omission
passive: The time-honored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out
active:  We frankly hold
active:  pupils know little
noverb:  nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John Smith by the time
active:  they reach the high school
active:  it is useless
active:  to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time
active:  It is worse
noverb:  than useless
active:  It is an offense
noverb:  against the teachers of those subjects
passive: are demonstrated
active:  to be progressive in character
active:  In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles
active:  Our reasons for this are simple
noverb:  The strategy of a campaign
active:  of a single battle is a highly technical
noverb:  usually a highly controversial
noverb:  matter about
active:  experts differ widely
noverb:  In the field of military
noverb:  naval operations most writers
active:  teachers of history are mere novices
active:  To dispose
active:  of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs
noverb:  given
noverb:  Any one
active:  compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign with the account given by Ropes, for instance,
active:  will ask for no further comment
novoice: No youth called upon
active:  to serve our country in arms
active:  would think
active:  turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare
noverb:  The dramatic scene or episode
noverb:  so useful
active:  arousing the interest of the immature pupil
active:  seems out of place in a book
active:  deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's serious responsibilities
active:  It is not upon negative features
noverb:  however
active:  we rest our case
active:  It is rather upon constructive features
noverb:  _First
noverb:  _ We have written a topical
noverb:  not a narrative
noverb:  history
active:  We have tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of each period
active:  bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration
noverb:  _Second
noverb:  _ We have emphasized those historical topics
active:  help to explain
active:  our nation has come to be
active:  it is to-day
noverb:  _Third
noverb:  _ We have dwelt fully upon the social
noverb:  economic aspects of our history
noverb:  especially in relation to the politics of each period
noverb:  _Fourth
noverb:  _ We have treated the causes and results of wars
noverb:  the problems
active:  financing and sustaining armed forces
noverb:  rather
noverb:  military strategy
noverb:  These are the subjects
active:  belong to a history for civilians
noverb:  These are matters
active:  civilians can understand
noverb:  matters
active:  they must understand
active:  they are
noverb:  to play well their part in war and peace
noverb:  _Fifth
noverb:  _
active:  omitting the period of exploration
active:  we have been able
active:  to enlarge the treatment of our own time
active:  We have given special attention to the history of those current questions
active:  must form the subject matter of sound instruction in citizenship
noverb:  _Sixth
noverb:  _ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique characteristics,
active:  is a part of a general civilization
active:  Accordingly we have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations
noverb:  the reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place
noverb:  _Seventh
noverb:  _ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity
noverb:  The study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory
active:  We have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association, reflection, and generalization
novoice: habits calculated
active:  to enlarge
active:  inform the mind
active:  We have been at great pains
active:  to make our text clear
noverb:  , simple
noverb:  direct
active:  we have earnestly sought to stretch the intellects of our readers
active:  to put them upon their mettle
active:  of them will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
active:  The world will soon expect maturity from them
active:  Their achievements will depend upon the possession of other powers
noverb:  memory alone
passive: The effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by the excellence of their judgment
noverb:  the fullness of their information

active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday

active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself

noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he

noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order

noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform

noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope

active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see

noverb:  For example

active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed

active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake

active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon

noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker

noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received

noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent

noverb:  Pray take a seat

noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman

active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he

noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me

active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed

noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things

active:  to name a subject

active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none

active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know

active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely

noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked

noverb:  Watson
active:  he added

active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day

noverb:  often twice

noverb:  of the Inner Temple
active:  See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline
noverb:  moustached
noverb:  evidently the man of

passive: brushed past the maid

active:  I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
noverb:  pacing up and down
noverb:  talking excitedly
active:  waving his arms
noverb:  Of her I could see nothing
active:  Presently he emerged
noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up
active:  she shot out of the hall door
noverb:  into it
active:  I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment
active:  she was a lovely woman
noverb:  with a face
active:  a man might die for
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
noverb:  John
active:  she cried
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  This was quite too good
active:  to lose
noverb:  Watson
active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind
active:  My cabby drove fast
noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster
active:  the others were there
noverb:  us
active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived
active:  I paid the man
active:  hurried into the church
active:  There was not a soul
active:  there save the two
active:  I had followed
noverb:  a surpliced clergyman
active:  seemed
active:  to be expostulating with them
active:  They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar
active:  I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler

noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my surprise
active:  the three at the altar faced round to me
active:  Godfrey Norton came running
active:  he could towards me
noverb:  Thank God
active:  he cried
active:  You'll do
active:  Come
active:  Come
active:  I asked
active:  Come
noverb:  man
active:  come
noverb:  only three minutes
noverb:  it won't be legal
active:  I was half-dragged
noverb:  up to the altar
active:  I knew
noverb:  I was I found myself mumbling responses
passive: were whispered in my ear
active:  vouching for things of

active:  generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler
noverb:  spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor
active:  It was all
active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced
novoice: It looked as
active:  the pair might take an immediate departure
active:  necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part

active:  to think of food
active:  I am likely
noverb:  to be busier still this evening
noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now
active:  he said as
active:  he turned hungrily on the simple fare
active:  our landlady had provided
active:  I must discuss it
active:  I eat
noverb:  for I have not much time
active:  It is nearly five
noverb:  now

noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable

novoice: fitted with a cap at

passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire

active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me

active:  I think, perhaps,
active:  it is almost time
active:  I prepare for the new role
active:  I have
active:  to play

active:  It was not merely
active:  Holmes changed his costume
noverb:  His expression
noverb:  his manner
active:  his very soul seemed
active:  to vary with every fresh part
active:  he assumed
active:  The stage lost a fine actor
novoice: even as science lost an acute reasoner
active:  he became a specialist in crime
noverb:  It was a quarter past six
active:  we left Baker Street
novoice: it still wanted ten minutes to the hour

active:  It was already dusk
noverb:  ,
passive: the lamps were just being lighted
active:  we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge
noverb:  waiting for the coming of its occupant

noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely

active:  she does not carry it about with her
noverb:  Where
noverb:  Her banker or her lawyer
active:  There is
noverb:  double possibility
passive: But I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  Women are naturally secretive
active:  they like to do their own secreting
active:  should she hand it over to anyone else
active:  She could trust her own guardianship
active:  she could not tell
noverb:  indirect

noverb:  in an instant the lady
active:  had stepped from her carriage

active:  Holmes dashed into the crowd
active:  to protect the lady
noverb:  just
active:  he reached her
active:  he gave a cry
active:  dropped to the ground
noverb:  with the blood running freely down his face

active:  had watched the scuffle without taking part in it
noverb:  crowded in
active:  to help the lady
active:  to attend to the injured man
noverb:  Irene Adler
noverb:  as I will still
active:  call her
active:  had hurried up the steps

active:  They were a gang
noverb:  a rough one
noverb:  too
noverb:  Ah
active:  he's breathing now
noverb:  He can't lie in the street

passive: he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
active:  he was playing
active:  I know
noverb:  I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
active:  I saw the beautiful creature against
active:  I was conspiring
noverb:  the grace and kindliness with
active:  she waited upon the injured man
noverb:  And
active:  it would be the blackest treachery
noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought
active:  we are not injuring her
active:  We are
active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another
active:  Holmes had sat up upon the couch
active:  I saw him motion
noverb:  a man
active:  is in need of air
novoice: A maid rushed across
noverb:  threw open the window
noverb:  At the same instant I saw him raise his hand
noverb:  at the signal

noverb:  well dressed

active:  to get away from the scene of uproar
active:  He walked swiftly
noverb:  in silence for some few minutes

noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  Nothing could
active:  have been better

active:  right
active:  You have the photograph
active:  I know
active:  it is
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you find out
active:  She showed me
active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery
active:  said he
noverb:  laughing
active:  The matter was perfectly simple
noverb:  You, of course, saw
active:  everyone in the street was an accomplice
active:  They were all engaged for the evening
active:  I guessed as much
active:  the row broke out
active:  I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
active:  I rushed forward
noverb:  fell down
active:  clapped my hand to my face
active:  became a piteous spectacle
active:  It is an old trick
active:  also I could fathom
active:  they carried me in
passive: She was bound
active:  to have me in
active:  else could
active:  she do
noverb:  And into her sitting-room
active:  was the very room

noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled
active:  to open the window
active:  you had your chance
active:  did
active:  help you
active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a
noverb:  perfectly overpowering impulse
active:  I have more than once taken advantage of it
active:  In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me
noverb:  also in the Arnsworth Castle business
noverb:  A married woman grabs at her baby
noverb:  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box
noverb:  Now

active:  She was there
noverb:  in an instant
active:  I caught a glimpse of it
active:  she half drew it out
novoice: When I cried out
active:  it was a false alarm
active:  she replaced it
novoice: glanced at the rocket
active:  rushed from the room
active:  I have not seen her
active:  I rose
active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find
noverb:  us nor the photograph
active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up
active:  we shall have a clear field

noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes

novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.

active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters

active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to

active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made

passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight

noverb:  we all three read it together

active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged

active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain

noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman

noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King

noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand

active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain

noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation

noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately

novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish

passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows

novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  I.
noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria

noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes

noverb:  hum
noverb:  La Scala
noverb:  hum
noverb:  Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw

passive: Retired from operatic stage

noverb:  Living in London
noverb:  quite
noverb:  Your Majesty
active:  I understand
active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered

noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him
noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked
noverb:  Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue
noverb:  St. John's Wood
active:  Holmes took a note of it
noverb:  One other question
active:  said he
noverb:  Was the photograph a cabinet
active:  It was
noverb:  good-night, your Majesty
active:  I trust
active:  we shall soon have some good news for you
noverb:  And good-night
noverb:  Watson
active:  he added
active:  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day
noverb:  returns at seven sharp for dinner

noverb:  often twice

noverb:  of the Inner Temple
active:  See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline

passive: brushed past the maid

active:  I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
noverb:  pacing up and down
noverb:  talking excitedly
active:  waving his arms
noverb:  Of her I could see nothing
active:  Presently he emerged
noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up

noverb:  After all

active:  you were likely
active:  to call

noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean

active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious

noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria
active:  It is in a German-speaking country
noverb:  in Bohemia
noverb:  not far from Carlsbad
noverb:  Remarkable
active:  being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Hum

noverb:  Contralto
noverb:  hum
noverb:  La Scala
noverb:  hum
noverb:  Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw
noverb:  yes
passive: Retired from operatic stage
noverb:  ha
noverb:  Living in London
noverb:  quite
noverb:  Your Majesty
active:  I understand
active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered
active:  We have tried and failed
active:  Your Majesty must pay
passive: It must be bought
active:  She will not sell
noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him

noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times

noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire

passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand

novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man

active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline
noverb:  moustached
noverb:  evidently the man of

noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up

noverb:  into it

noverb:  with a face
active:  a man might die for
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
noverb:  John
active:  she cried
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes

active:  to lose
noverb:  Watson
active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind
active:  My cabby drove fast
noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster
active:  the others were there
noverb:  us
active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived
active:  I paid the man
active:  hurried into the church
active:  There was not a soul
active:  there save the two
active:  I had followed
noverb:  a surpliced clergyman
active:  seemed
active:  to be expostulating with them

noverb:  to my surprise
active:  the three at the altar faced round to me

active:  he cried
active:  You'll do
active:  Come
active:  Come
active:  I asked
active:  Come
noverb:  man

noverb:  spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor
active:  It was all
active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced
novoice: It looked as
active:  the pair might take an immediate departure
active:  necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part
active:  At the church door, however, they separated
noverb:  he driving back to the Temple
noverb:  she to her own house
active:  I shall drive out in the park at five as usual

active:  to make my own arrangements
active:  are
noverb:  Some cold beef and a glass of beer
active:  he answered
active:  ringing the bell

active:  to think of food
active:  I am likely
noverb:  to be busier still this evening
noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now
active:  he said as
active:  he turned hungrily on the simple fare
active:  our landlady had provided
active:  I must discuss it
active:  I eat
noverb:  for I have not much time
active:  It is nearly five
noverb:  now
active:  In two hours we must be on the scene of action
noverb:  Miss Irene
noverb:  Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven

noverb:  You quite follow me
noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable
active:  he said
active:  taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket
active:  It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me
active:  That is excellent
active:  I think, perhaps,
active:  it is almost time
active:  I prepare for the new role
active:  I have
active:  to play

novoice: even as science lost an acute reasoner

active:  The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now
active:  The chances are

active:  are we
active:  to find the photograph
noverb:  Where
noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely

active:  I saw the beautiful creature against

noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought

noverb:  did you find out

active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery

noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled

active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a

active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find

active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up

noverb:  Besides
active:  we must be prompt
noverb:  , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
active:  I must wire to the King without delay
active:  We had reached Baker Street
active:  had stopped at the door
active:  He was searching his pockets for the key
active:  someone passing said
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes
active:  There were several people on the pavement at the time
novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.
active:  I slept at Baker Street that night
passive: we were engaged upon our toast
noverb:  coffee in the morning
active:  the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
active:  You have really got it
active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters
active:  We descended and started off once
noverb:  for Briony Lodge
passive: Irene Adler is married
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to
active:  To an English lawyer named Norton
active:  she could not love him
active:  I am in hopes
active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made
active:  He relapsed into a moody silence
passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight
active:  Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
noverb:  tore back a small sliding shutter
active:  plunging in his hand
novoice: pulled out a photograph and a letter
active:  The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
passive: the letter was superscribed to
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
passive: Esq. To be left till called for
noverb:  My friend tore it open
noverb:  we all three read it together
passive: It was dated at midnight of the preceding night
active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged
active:  I keep it only
active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain
noverb:  dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Very truly yours
noverb:  IRENE NORTON
noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman
active:  cried the King of Bohemia
noverb:  we had all three read this epistle
active:  Did I not tell you
noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King
active:  nothing could be more successful
active:  I know
active:  her word is inviolate
active:  The photograph is now
active:  it were in the fire
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear your Majesty
active:  say
active:  I am immensely indebted
noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand
active:  Your Majesty has something
active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another
noverb:  vacancy open
active:  entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services
noverb:  All red-headed men
noverb:  who are sound
noverb:  in body
noverb:  mind
noverb:  above the age of twenty-one years
active:  are eligible
active:  Apply in person on Monday
noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all

noverb:  I.
noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes
active:  she is always the woman
noverb:  I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
active:  In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex
active:  It was not
active:  he felt any emotion akin
active:  to love for Irene Adler
noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly
active:  were abhorrent to his cold
noverb:  precise
noverb:  admirably balanced mind
active:  He was
active:  I take it
noverb:  the most perfect reasoning
noverb:  observing machine
active:  the world has seen
noverb:  as a lover
active:  he would have placed himself in a false position
noverb:  He never spoke of the softer passions
noverb:  save with a gibe and a sneer
active:  They were admirable things for the observer
noverb:  excellent
active:  drawing the veil from men's motives and actions
noverb:  for the trained reasoner
active:  to admit such intrusions into his own delicate
novoice: finely adjusted
active:  temperament was to introduce a distracting factor
active:  might throw a doubt upon all his mental results
noverb:  Grit in a sensitive instrument
noverb:  a crack in one of his own high-power lenses
active:  would not be more disturbing
noverb:  a strong emotion in a nature such as his
noverb:  And
active:  there was
noverb:  one woman to him
active:  that woman was the late Irene Adler
noverb:  of dubious and questionable memory
active:  I had seen little of Holmes lately
active:  My marriage had drifted us away from each other
noverb:  My own complete happiness
noverb:  the home-centred interests
active:  rise up around the man
noverb:  first finds himself master of his own establishment
active:  were sufficient
active:  to absorb all my attention
noverb:  Holmes
active:  loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul
novoice: remained in our lodgings in Baker Street
noverb:  buried among his old books
active:  alternating from week to week between cocaine
noverb:  ambition
noverb:  the drowsiness of the drug
noverb:  the fierce energy of his own keen nature
active:  He was still
noverb:  , as
passive: deeply attracted by the study of crime
active:  occupied his immense faculties
noverb:  extraordinary powers of observation
active:  following out those clues
active:  clearing up those mysteries
passive: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police
active:  From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings
noverb:  of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder
noverb:  of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
noverb:  finally of the mission
active:  he had accomplished
noverb:  delicately
noverb:  successfully for the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  Beyond these signs of his activity, however,
active:  I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press
active:  I knew little of my former friend and companion
active:  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice)
active:  my way led me through Baker Street
active:  As I passed the well-remembered door
passive: must always be associated in my mind with my wooing
noverb:  with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet
passive: I was seized with a keen desire
active:  to see Holmes again
active:  to know
active:  he was employing his extraordinary powers
passive: His rooms were brilliantly lit
noverb:  even
active:  I looked up
active:  I saw his tall
noverb:  spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind
active:  He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
passive: sunk
novoice: upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him
noverb:  To me
active:  knew his every mood
noverb:  habit
noverb:  his attitude
active:  manner told their own story
active:  He was at work again
active:  He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
active:  was hot upon the scent of some new problem
active:  I rang the bell
active:  was shown up to the chamber
active:  had formerly been in part my own
active:  His manner was not effusive
active:  It seldom was
active:  he was glad
active:  I think
active:  to see me
active:  With hardly a word spoken
noverb:  with a kindly eye
active:  he waved me to an armchair
active:  threw across his case of cigars
active:  indicated a spirit case
noverb:  a gasogene in the corner
active:  he stood
noverb:  the fire
active:  looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
active:  Wedlock suits you
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have put on seven and a half pounds
active:  I saw you
noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope
active:  I must be dull
noverb:  , indeed,
active:  I do not pronounce him
active:  to be an active member of the medical profession
active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this
active:  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper
active:  had been lying open upon the table
active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud
active:  The note was undated
noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman
active:  desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown
active:  you are one
noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar
active:  that is the very word
active:  said Holmes
active:  It is not an English paper at all
active:  Hold it up to the light
active:  I did
active:  saw a large
noverb:  E
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  g
noverb:  a
noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft
active:  is the German for 'Company
active:  It is a customary contraction
noverb:  like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier
noverb:  Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer
active:  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
noverb:  Eglow
noverb:  Eglonitz
noverb:  here we are
noverb:  Egria
active:  It is in a German-speaking country
noverb:  in Bohemia
noverb:  not far from Carlsbad
noverb:  Remarkable
active:  being the scene of the death of Wallenstein
noverb:  for its numerous glass-factories
noverb:  paper-mills
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  my boy
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  His eyes sparkled
active:  he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German
active:  writes upon Bohemian paper
noverb:  prefers wearing a mask
active:  to showing his face
noverb:  And here he comes
passive: I am not mistaken
active:  to resolve all our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs
noverb:  grating wheels against the curb
passive: followed by a sharp pull at the bell
active:  Holmes whistled
noverb:  A pair
noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes
active:  he continued
active:  glancing out of the window
noverb:  A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties
noverb:  A hundred and fifty guineas apiece
active:  There's money in this case, Watson,
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  else
active:  I think
active:  I had
active:  better go
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  Stay
active:  you are
passive: I am lost without my Boswell
noverb:  And this promises
active:  to be interesting
active:  It would be a pity
active:  to miss it
noverb:  your client
active:  Never mind him
active:  I may want your help
active:  may he
noverb:  Here he comes
active:  Sit down in that armchair
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  give us your best attention
noverb:  A slow and heavy step
passive: had been heard upon the stairs
noverb:  in the passage
novoice: paused immediately outside the door
active:  there was a loud and authoritative tap
active:  Come in
active:  said Holmes
active:  A man entered
noverb:  could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height
noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules
active:  His dress was rich with a richness
active:  would
passive: , in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste
passive: Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat
noverb:  the deep blue cloak
passive: was thrown
passive: over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk
passive: secured at the neck with a brooch
active:  consisted of a single flaming beryl
noverb:  Boots
novoice: extended halfway up his calves
passive: were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur
active:  completed the impression of barbaric opulence
passive: was suggested by his whole appearance
active:  He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand
active:  he wore across the upper part of his face
active:  extending down past the cheekbones
noverb:  a black vizard mask
active:  he had apparently adjusted that very moment
passive: for his hand was still raised to it
active:  he entered
active:  From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
noverb:  a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution
novoice: pushed to the length of obstinacy
active:  You had my note
active:  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent
active:  I told you
active:  I would call
active:  He looked from one to the other of us
noverb:  as
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to address
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  who is occasionally good enough
active:  to help me in my cases
noverb:  have I the honour
active:  to address
active:  You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman
active:  I understand
active:  this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
noverb:  discretion
active:  I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance
noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with
noverb:  you alone
active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor
noverb:  The august person
noverb:  employs me wishes his agent
active:  to be unknown to you
active:  I may confess at once
noverb:  the title by
active:  I have just called
active:  myself is not exactly my own
active:  I was aware
noverb:  of it
active:  said Holmes dryly
active:  The circumstances are of great delicacy
active:  every precaution has to be taken to quench
active:  might grow to be an immense scandal
active:  seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe
active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried
active:  I am the King
active:  should I attempt to conceal it
noverb:  indeed
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Your Majesty had not spoken
active:  I was aware
noverb:  that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein
noverb:  Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein
noverb:  hereditary King of Bohemia
active:  you can understand
active:  said our strange visitor
active:  sitting down once
active:  passing his hand over his high white forehead
active:  you can understand
passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw
active:  I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler
active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  opening his eyes
active:  For many years he had adopted a system
active:  docketing all paragraphs concerning men
noverb:  things
active:  it was difficult
active:  to name a subject
noverb:  a person on
active:  he could not at once furnish information
active:  In this case I found
active:  her biography sandwiched in between
noverb:  of a Hebrew rabbi
noverb:  of a staff-commander
active:  had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
noverb:  Let me see

active:  became entangled with this young person
active:  wrote her some compromising letters
active:  is now desirous
active:  getting those letters
active:  back
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Was there a secret marriage
noverb:  None
noverb:  No legal papers or certificates
noverb:  None
active:  I fail to follow your Majesty
active:  this young person should produce her letters
active:  blackmailing
noverb:  other purposes
active:  is she
active:  to prove their authenticity
active:  There is the writing
noverb:  Pooh
noverb:  pooh
noverb:  Forgery
noverb:  My private note-paper
noverb:  Stolen
noverb:  My own seal
novoice: Imitated
noverb:  My photograph
novoice: Bought
active:  We were
noverb:  in the photograph
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  dear
active:  That is very bad
active:  Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
active:  I was mad
noverb:  --insane
active:  You have compromised yourself seriously
active:  I was only Crown Prince
noverb:  then
active:  I was young
active:  I am
noverb:  thirty now
passive: It must be recovered
active:  We have tried and failed
active:  Your Majesty must pay
passive: It must be bought
active:  She will not sell
noverb:  Stolen
passive: Five attempts have been made
noverb:  Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house
active:  Once we diverted her luggage
active:  she travelled
passive: Twice she has been waylaid
active:  There has been no result
noverb:  No sign of it
noverb:  Absolutely none
active:  Holmes laughed
active:  It is quite a pretty little problem
active:  said he
noverb:  a very serious one to me
active:  returned the King reproachfully
noverb:  Very
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  And
active:  does she propose
active:  to do with the photograph
active:  To ruin me
active:  I am about
passive: to be married
active:  I have heard
noverb:  To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen
noverb:  second daughter of the King of Scandinavia
active:  You may know the strict principles of her family
noverb:  She is herself the very soul of delicacy
noverb:  A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
noverb:  And Irene Adler
noverb:  Threatens to send them the photograph
active:  And she will do it
active:  I know
active:  she will do it
active:  You do not know her
active:  she has a soul of steel
active:  She has the face of the most beautiful of women
noverb:  the mind of the most resolute of men
noverb:  Rather
active:  I should marry another woman
active:  there are no lengths
noverb:  to
active:  she would not go
noverb:  none
active:  You are sure
active:  she has not sent it
active:  I am sure
noverb:  And
active:  she has said
active:  she would send it on the day
passive: the betrothal was publicly proclaimed
active:  That will be next Monday
noverb:  Oh
active:  we have three days
active:  said Holmes with a yawn
active:  That is very fortunate
active:  I have one or two matters of importance
active:  to look into just at present
active:  Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
novoice: to let
active:  you know
active:  we progress
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  I shall be all
noverb:  anxiety
noverb:  as to money
active:  You have carte blanche
noverb:  Absolutely
active:  I tell you
active:  I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
active:  to have
noverb:  photograph
noverb:  And for present expenses
active:  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
active:  laid it on the table
active:  There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
active:  he said
active:  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book
active:  handed it to him
noverb:  And Mademoiselle's address
active:  he asked
noverb:  Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue
noverb:  St. John's Wood
active:  Holmes took a note of it
noverb:  One other question
active:  said he
noverb:  Was the photograph a cabinet
active:  It was
noverb:  good-night, your Majesty
active:  I trust
active:  we shall soon have some good news for you
noverb:  And good-night
noverb:  Watson
active:  he added
active:  as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
noverb:  II.
noverb:  At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street
active:  Holmes had not yet returned
active:  The landlady informed me
active:  he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning
active:  I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention
active:  awaiting him
noverb:  however long he might be
active:  I was already deeply interested
noverb:  in his inquiry
noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
passive: were associated with the two crimes
active:  I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
noverb:  gave it a character of its own
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success
active:  the very possibility of his failing had ceased
active:  to enter into my head
active:  It was close
noverb:  upon four
active:  the door opened
noverb:  a drunken-looking groom
noverb:  ill-kempt
noverb:  side-whiskered
noverb:  with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes
novoice: walked into the room
noverb:  Accustomed
active:  I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises
active:  I had to look three times
active:  I was certain
noverb:  that it was indeed he
active:  With a nod he vanished into the bedroom
active:  whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable
noverb:  as of old
noverb:  Putting his hands into his pockets
active:  he stretched out his legs in front of the fire
novoice: laughed heartily for some minutes
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  he cried
active:  he choked and laughed again
passive: he was obliged
active:  to lie back
noverb:  limp
noverb:  helpless
noverb:  in the chair
active:  is it
active:  It's quite too funny
active:  I am sure
active:  you could never guess
active:  I employed my morning
active:  I ended
active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men
active:  Be one of them
active:  you will know all
active:  there is
active:  to know
active:  I soon found Briony Lodge
active:  It is a bijou villa
noverb:  with a garden at the back
novoice: built out in front right up to the road
noverb:  two stories
noverb:  Chubb lock to the door
noverb:  Large sitting-room on the right side
noverb:  , well furnished
noverb:  with long windows almost to the floor
noverb:  those preposterous English window fasteners
active:  a child could open
active:  Behind there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house
active:  I walked round it
active:  examined it closely from every point of view
active:  noting anything else of interest
noverb:  I
active:  lounged down the street
noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane
active:  runs down by one wall of the garden
noverb:  I lent the ostlers a hand
active:  rubbing down their horses
novoice: received in exchange twopence
noverb:  a glass of half-and-half
noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part
active:  She is the daintiest thing
noverb:  under a bonnet on this planet
active:  say the Serpentine-mews
noverb:  to a man
active:  She lives quietly
active:  sings at concerts
active:  drives out at five every day
noverb:  returns at seven sharp for dinner
active:  Seldom goes out at other times
active:  she sings
active:  Has only one male visitor
noverb:  a good deal of him
active:  He is dark
noverb:  handsome, and dashing
active:  never calls less than once a day
noverb:  often twice
active:  He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton
noverb:  of the Inner Temple
active:  See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant
noverb:  They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews
active:  knew all about him
active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell
active:  I began
active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely
active:  I answered
active:  I was still balancing the matter in my mind
active:  a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge
active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline
noverb:  moustached
noverb:  evidently the man of
active:  I had heard
active:  He appeared
active:  to be in a great hurry
passive: shouted to the cabman
active:  to wait
passive: brushed past the maid
active:  opened the door with the air of a man
active:  was thoroughly at home
active:  He was in the house about half an hour
active:  I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room
noverb:  pacing up and down
noverb:  talking excitedly
active:  waving his arms
noverb:  Of her I could see nothing
active:  Presently he emerged
noverb:  looking even more flurried
noverb:  before
active:  he stepped up to the cab
active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went
active:  I was just wondering
active:  I should not do well to follow them
active:  up the lane came a neat little landau
noverb:  the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned
noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
noverb:  It hadn't pulled up
active:  she shot out of the hall door
noverb:  into it
active:  I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment
active:  she was a lovely woman
noverb:  with a face
active:  a man might die for
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
noverb:  John
active:  she cried
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  This was quite too good
active:  to lose
noverb:  Watson
active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind
active:  My cabby drove fast
noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster
active:  the others were there
noverb:  us
active:  The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door
active:  I arrived
active:  I paid the man
active:  hurried into the church
active:  There was not a soul
active:  there save the two
active:  I had followed
noverb:  a surpliced clergyman
active:  seemed
active:  to be expostulating with them
active:  They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar
active:  I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler
active:  has dropped into a church
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my surprise
active:  the three at the altar faced round to me
active:  Godfrey Norton came running
active:  he could towards me
noverb:  Thank God
active:  he cried
active:  You'll do
active:  Come
active:  Come
active:  I asked
active:  Come
noverb:  man
active:  come
noverb:  only three minutes
noverb:  it won't be legal
active:  I was half-dragged
noverb:  up to the altar
active:  I knew
noverb:  I was I found myself mumbling responses
passive: were whispered in my ear
active:  vouching for things of
active:  I knew nothing
active:  generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler
noverb:  spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor
active:  It was all
active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,
active:  I found my plans very seriously menaced
novoice: It looked as
active:  the pair might take an immediate departure
active:  necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part
active:  At the church door, however, they separated
noverb:  he driving back to the Temple
noverb:  she to her own house
active:  I shall drive out in the park at five as usual
active:  she said
active:  she left him
active:  I heard no
active:  They drove away in different directions
active:  I went off
active:  to make my own arrangements
active:  are
noverb:  Some cold beef and a glass of beer
active:  he answered
active:  ringing the bell
active:  I have been too busy
active:  to think of food
active:  I am likely
noverb:  to be busier still this evening
noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now
active:  he said as
active:  he turned hungrily on the simple fare
active:  our landlady had provided
active:  I must discuss it
active:  I eat
noverb:  for I have not much time
active:  It is nearly five
noverb:  now
active:  In two hours we must be on the scene of action
noverb:  Miss Irene
noverb:  Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven
active:  We must be at Briony Lodge
active:  to meet her
noverb:  And
active:  You must leave

active:  I am to be neutral
active:  To do nothing
active:  There will probably be some small unpleasantness
active:  Do not join in
noverb:  it
passive: It will end in my being conveyed into the house
noverb:  Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open
active:  You are to station yourself close
noverb:  to
noverb:  open window
noverb:  Yes
active:  You are to watch me
noverb:  for
active:  I will be visible
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Yes
active:  And when I raise my hand--so--
active:  you will throw into the room
active:  I give you
active:  to throw
active:  will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire
noverb:  You quite follow me
noverb:  Entirely
active:  It is nothing
noverb:  very formidable
active:  he said
active:  taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket
active:  It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
novoice: fitted with a cap at
active:  end to make it self-lighting
passive: Your task is confined to that
active:  When you raise your cry of fire
passive: it will be taken up by quite a number of people
active:  You may
active:  walk to the end of the street
active:  I will rejoin you in ten minutes
active:  I hope
noverb:  I have made myself clear
active:  I am to remain neutral
active:  to get near the window
active:  to watch you
noverb:  at the signal
active:  to throw in this object
active:  to raise the cry of fire
active:  to wait you at the corner of the street
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you may entirely rely on me
active:  That is excellent
active:  I think, perhaps,
active:  it is almost time
active:  I prepare for the new role
active:  I have
active:  to play
active:  He disappeared into his bedroom
novoice: returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman
noverb:  His broad black hat
noverb:  his baggy trousers
noverb:  his white tie
noverb:  his sympathetic smile
noverb:  general look
active:  peering
active:  benevolent curiosity were
active:  such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled
active:  It was not merely
active:  Holmes changed his costume
noverb:  His expression
noverb:  his manner
active:  his very soul seemed
active:  to vary with every fresh part
active:  he assumed
active:  The stage lost a fine actor
novoice: even as science lost an acute reasoner
active:  he became a specialist in crime
noverb:  It was a quarter past six
active:  we left Baker Street
novoice: it still wanted ten minutes to the hour
active:  we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue
active:  It was already dusk
noverb:  ,
passive: the lamps were just being lighted
active:  we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge
noverb:  waiting for the coming of its occupant
active:  The house was just such as I
active:  had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description
novoice: the locality appeared
active:  to be less private
active:  I expected
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood
passive: it was remarkably animated
active:  There was a group of shabbily dressed men
active:  smoking and laughing in a corner
noverb:  a scissors-grinder with his wheel
noverb:  two guardsmen
active:  were flirting with a nurse-girl
noverb:  several well-dressed young men
active:  were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
active:  You see
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  we paced to
noverb:  fro in front of the house
active:  this marriage rather simplifies matters
active:  The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now
active:  The chances are
passive: she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton
active:  our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess
active:  Now the question is
active:  are we
active:  to find the photograph
noverb:  Where
noverb:  indeed
active:  It is most
noverb:  unlikely
active:  she carries it about with her
active:  It is cabinet size
noverb:  Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress
active:  She knows
active:  the King is capable
noverb:  having her waylaid and searched
passive: Two attempts of the sort have already been made
active:  We may take it
active:  she does not carry it about with her
noverb:  Where
noverb:  Her banker or her lawyer
active:  There is
noverb:  double possibility
passive: But I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  Women are naturally secretive
active:  they like to do their own secreting
active:  should she hand it over to anyone else
active:  She could trust her own guardianship
active:  she could not tell
noverb:  indirect
passive: political influence might be brought
active:  to bear upon a business man
noverb:  Besides
active:  remember
active:  she had resolved to use it within a few days
active:  It must be
active:  she can lay her hands upon it
active:  It must be in her own house
passive: it has twice been burgled
noverb:  Pshaw
active:  They did not know
active:  to look
active:  will you look
active:  I will not look
active:  I will get her
active:  to show me
active:  she will refuse
active:  She will not be able to
active:  But I hear the rumble of wheels
noverb:  It is her carriage
active:  Now carry out my orders to the letter
noverb:  As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage
active:  came round the curve of the avenue
active:  It was a smart little landau
active:  rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge
novoice: As it pulled up
active:  one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward
active:  to open the door in the hope
active:  earning a copper
passive: was elbowed away by another loafer
active:  had rushed up with the same intention
active:  A fierce quarrel broke out
passive: was increased by the two guardsmen
active:  took sides with one of the loungers
noverb:  by the scissors-grinder
noverb:  who was equally hot
noverb:  upon the other side
passive: A blow was struck
noverb:  in an instant the lady
active:  had stepped from her carriage
active:  was the centre of a little knot of flushed
noverb:  struggling men
passive: struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks
active:  Holmes dashed into the crowd
active:  to protect the lady
noverb:  just
active:  he reached her
active:  he gave a cry
active:  dropped to the ground
noverb:  with the blood running freely down his face
active:  At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other
active:  a number of better dressed people
active:  had watched the scuffle without taking part in it
noverb:  crowded in
active:  to help the lady
active:  to attend to the injured man
noverb:  Irene Adler
noverb:  as I will still
active:  call her
active:  had hurried up the steps
active:  she stood
active:  at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall
noverb:  looking back into the street
active:  Is the poor gentleman much hurt
active:  she asked
active:  He is dead
active:  cried several voices
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  there's life in him
noverb:  shouted another
passive: he'll be gone
active:  you can get him to hospital
active:  He's a brave fellow
active:  said a woman
active:  They would have had the lady's purse
noverb:  watch
noverb:  it hadn't been for him
active:  They were a gang
noverb:  a rough one
noverb:  too
noverb:  Ah
active:  he's breathing now
noverb:  He can't lie in the street
active:  May we bring him in
noverb:  marm
noverb:  Surely
active:  Bring him into the sitting-room
active:  There is a comfortable sofa
noverb:  This way
noverb:  Slowly
passive: solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge
passive: laid out in the principal room
noverb:  I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window
passive: The lamps had been lit
passive: the blinds had not been drawn
noverb:  I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch
active:  I do not know
passive: he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
active:  he was playing
active:  I know
noverb:  I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
active:  I saw the beautiful creature against
active:  I was conspiring
noverb:  the grace and kindliness with
active:  she waited upon the injured man
noverb:  And
active:  it would be the blackest treachery
noverb:  to Holmes
active:  to draw back now from the part
active:  he had intrusted to me
active:  I hardened my heart
active:  took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster
noverb:  After all
active:  I thought
active:  we are not injuring her
active:  We are
active:  preventing her
active:  injuring another
active:  Holmes had sat up upon the couch
active:  I saw him motion
noverb:  a man
active:  is in need of air
novoice: A maid rushed across
noverb:  threw open the window
noverb:  At the same instant I saw him raise his hand
noverb:  at the signal
active:  I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of
noverb:  Fire
active:  The word was no sooner out of my mouth
noverb:  the whole crowd of spectators
noverb:  well dressed
noverb:  ill
noverb:  gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids
passive: joined in a general shriek of
noverb:  Fire
active:  Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room
noverb:  out at the open window
active:  I caught a glimpse of rushing figures
noverb:  a moment later the voice of Holmes from
active:  assuring them
active:  it was a false alarm
passive: Slipping through the shouting crowd
active:  I made my way to the corner of the street
passive: in ten minutes was rejoiced
active:  to find my friend's arm in mine
active:  to get away from the scene of uproar
active:  He walked swiftly
noverb:  in silence for some few minutes
active:  we had turned down one of the quiet streets
active:  lead towards the Edgeware Road
active:  You did it very nicely
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  Nothing could
active:  have been better
active:  It is all
active:  right
active:  You have the photograph
active:  I know
active:  it is
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you find out
active:  She showed me
active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery
active:  said he
noverb:  laughing
active:  The matter was perfectly simple
noverb:  You, of course, saw
active:  everyone in the street was an accomplice
active:  They were all engaged for the evening
active:  I guessed as much
active:  the row broke out
active:  I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
active:  I rushed forward
noverb:  fell down
active:  clapped my hand to my face
active:  became a piteous spectacle
active:  It is an old trick
active:  also I could fathom
active:  they carried me in
passive: She was bound
active:  to have me in
active:  else could
active:  she do
noverb:  And into her sitting-room
active:  was the very room
active:  I suspected
active:  It lay between
noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled
active:  to open the window
active:  you had your chance
active:  did
active:  help you
active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a
noverb:  perfectly overpowering impulse
active:  I have more than once taken advantage of it
active:  In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me
noverb:  also in the Arnsworth Castle business
noverb:  A married woman grabs at her baby
noverb:  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box
noverb:  Now
active:  it was clear
noverb:  to me
noverb:  our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
noverb:  to her
active:  we are in quest of
active:  She would rush to secure it
passive: The alarm of fire was admirably done
active:  The smoke and shouting were enough
active:  to shake nerves of steel
active:  She responded beautifully
active:  The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull
active:  She was there
noverb:  in an instant
active:  I caught a glimpse of it
active:  she half drew it out
novoice: When I cried out
active:  it was a false alarm
active:  she replaced it
novoice: glanced at the rocket
active:  rushed from the room
active:  I have not seen her
active:  I rose
active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find
noverb:  us nor the photograph
active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up
active:  we shall have a clear field
noverb:  Besides
active:  we must be prompt
noverb:  , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
active:  I must wire to the King without delay
active:  We had reached Baker Street
active:  had stopped at the door
active:  He was searching his pockets for the key
active:  someone passing said
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes
active:  There were several people on the pavement at the time
novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.
active:  I slept at Baker Street that night
passive: we were engaged upon our toast
noverb:  coffee in the morning
active:  the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
active:  You have really got it
active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters
active:  We descended and started off once
noverb:  for Briony Lodge
passive: Irene Adler is married
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to
active:  To an English lawyer named Norton
active:  she could not love him
active:  I am in hopes
active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made
active:  He relapsed into a moody silence
passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight
active:  Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
noverb:  tore back a small sliding shutter
active:  plunging in his hand
novoice: pulled out a photograph and a letter
active:  The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
passive: the letter was superscribed to
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
passive: Esq. To be left till called for
noverb:  My friend tore it open
noverb:  we all three read it together
passive: It was dated at midnight of the preceding night
active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged
active:  I keep it only
active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain
noverb:  dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Very truly yours
noverb:  IRENE NORTON
noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman
active:  cried the King of Bohemia
noverb:  we had all three read this epistle
active:  Did I not tell you
noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King
active:  nothing could be more successful
active:  I know
active:  her word is inviolate
active:  The photograph is now
active:  it were in the fire
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear your Majesty
active:  say
active:  I am immensely indebted
noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand
active:  Your Majesty has something
active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows

noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all
active:  I see
active:  the other answered with the utmost coolness
active:  I fancy
active:  my pal is all right
active:  I see
active:  you have got his coat-tails
noverb:  There are three men waiting for him at the door
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem to have done the thing very completely
active:  I must compliment you
noverb:  And I you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  Your red-headed idea was very new and effective
active:  You'll see your pal again presently
active:  said Jones
active:  He's quicker
active:  climbing down holes
active:  I am
active:  Just hold out
active:  I fix the derbies
active:  I beg
active:  you will not touch me with your filthy hands
active:  remarked our prisoner
active:  the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
active:  You may not be aware
active:  I have royal blood in my veins
active:  Have the goodness, also,
active:  you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please
noverb:  All right
active:  said Jones with a stare and a snigger
noverb:  Well,
active:  would you
noverb:  sir
noverb:  march upstairs
active:  we can get a cab
active:  to carry your Highness to the police-station?
active:  That is better
active:  said John Clay serenely
active:  He made a sweeping bow to the three of us
novoice: walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  we followed them from the cellar
active:  I do not know
active:  the bank can thank you
active:  repay you
active:  There is no doubt
noverb:  that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
active:  have ever come within my experience
active:  I have had one or two little scores of my own
active:  to settle with Mr. John Clay
active:  said Holmes
active:  I have been at some small expense over this matter
active:  I shall expect the bank
active:  to refund
noverb:  beyond
passive: I am amply repaid
active:  having had an experience
active:  is in many ways unique
active:  hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street
active:  it was perfectly obvious
noverb:  from the first
noverb:  the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League
noverb:  the copying of the Encyclopaedia
active:  must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
active:  It was a curious way
active:  managing it
noverb:  , really,
active:  it would be difficult
active:  to suggest a better
active:  The method was no doubt
passive: suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair
active:  The $4 a week was a lure
active:  must draw him
active:  was it to them
active:  were playing for thousands
active:  They put in the advertisement
active:  one rogue has the temporary office
active:  the other rogue incites the man
active:  to apply for it
active:  together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
noverb:  From the time
active:  I heard
active:  of the assistant having come for half wages
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  he had some strong motive
active:  securing the situation
active:  could you guess
active:  the motive was
passive: Had
active:  there been women
noverb:  in the house
active:  I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
active:  , however, was out of the question
noverb:  The man's business was a small one
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in his house
active:  could account for such elaborate preparations
noverb:  such an expenditure
active:  they were at
active:  It must
active:  be something out of the house
active:  could it be
active:  I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography
noverb:  his trick
active:  vanishing into the cellar
noverb:  The cellar
active:  There was the end of this tangled clue
active:  Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant
active:  found
active:  I had
active:  to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London
active:  He was doing something in the cellar
noverb:  something
active:  took many hours a day for months on end
active:  could it be
noverb:  once
active:  I could think of nothing save
active:  he was running a tunnel to some other building
active:  So far I had got
active:  we went to visit the scene of action
active:  I surprised you
active:  beating upon the pavement with my stick
active:  I was ascertaining
novoice: the cellar stretched out in front
noverb:  behind
active:  It was not in front
active:  Then I rang the bell
active:  I hoped
active:  the assistant answered it
active:  We have had some skirmishes
active:  we had never set eyes upon each other before
active:  I hardly looked at his face
active:  His knees were
active:  I wished
active:  to see
noverb:  You must yourself have remarked
noverb:  worn
noverb:  wrinkled
noverb:  stained they were
noverb:  They spoke of those hours
active:  burrowing
active:  The only remaining point was
active:  they were burrowing for
active:  I walked round the corner
active:  saw the City
active:  Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises
active:  felt
active:  I had solved my problem
active:  When you drove home after the concert
active:  I called upon Scotland Yard
noverb:  upon the chairman of the bank directors
noverb:  with the result
active:  you have seen
noverb:  And
active:  could you tell
active:  they would make their attempt to-night
noverb:  ?
active:  I asked
noverb:  Well,
active:  they closed their League offices
active:  was a sign
active:  they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence
noverb:  in other words
active:  they had completed their tunnel
active:  it was essential
noverb:  that they should use it soon
passive: as it might be discovered
passive: the bullion might be removed
active:  Saturday would suit them better
noverb:  any other day
active:  as it would give them two days for their escape
active:  For all these reasons I expected them
active:  to come to-night
active:  You reasoned it out beautifully
active:  I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
active:  It is so long
noverb:  a chain
noverb:  every link rings true
active:  It saved me from ennui
active:  he answered
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Alas
active:  I already feel it closing in upon me
passive: My life is spent in one long effort
active:  to escape from the commonplaces of existence
active:  These little problems help me
active:  to do
noverb:  And
active:  you are a benefactor of the race
active:  said I.
active:  He shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  Well,
active:  perhaps, after all, it is of some little use
active:  he remarked
noverb:  L'homme c'est rien
noverb:  l'oeuvre c'est tout
active:  Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
noverb:  ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on
noverb:  side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street
active:  life is infinitely stranger
noverb:  anything
active:  the mind of man could invent
active:  We would not dare to conceive the things
active:  are really mere commonplaces of existence
active:  we could fly out of that window hand in hand
active:  hover over this great city
active:  gently remove the roofs
noverb:  peep in at the queer things
active:  are going on
noverb:  the strange coincidences
noverb:  the plannings
noverb:  the cross-purposes
noverb:  the wonderful chains of events
noverb:  working through generations
active:  leading to the most outre results
active:  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
noverb:  foreseen conclusions most stale
noverb:  unprofitable
noverb:  And
active:  I am not convinced
noverb:  of it
active:  I answered
noverb:  The cases
active:  come to light
active:  in the papers are
active:  , as a rule, bald enough
noverb:  vulgar enough
active:  We have
active:  in our police reports realism
novoice: pushed to its extreme limits
active:  the result is
passive: it must be confessed
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  artistic
passive: A certain selection and discretion must be used
active:  producing a realistic effect
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  This is wanting in the police report
passive: more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate
noverb:  upon the details
active:  to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
active:  Depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so unnatural as the commonplace
active:  I smiled and shook my head
noverb:  I can quite understand your thinking
active:  I said
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody
passive: is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
passive: you are brought in contact with all
active:  is strange and bizarre
noverb:  here
noverb:  --I picked up the morning paper from the ground--
noverb:  let us put it to a practical test
active:  Here is the first heading upon
active:  I come
noverb:  A husband's cruelty to his wife
active:  There is half a column of print
active:  I know without reading it
active:  it is all
noverb:  perfectly familiar to me
active:  There is, of course, the other woman
noverb:  the drink
noverb:  the push
noverb:  the blow
noverb:  the bruise
noverb:  the sympathetic sister or landlady
active:  The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
active:  said Holmes
active:  taking the paper
active:  glancing his eye down it
active:  This is the Dundas separation case
active:  it happens
passive: I was engaged
active:  clearing up some small points in connection with it
active:  The husband was a teetotaler
active:  there was no other woman
active:  the conduct complained
active:  was
active:  he had drifted into the habit
active:  winding up every meal
active:  taking out his false teeth
active:  hurling them at his wife
active:  you will allow
active:  is not an action likely
active:  to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller
active:  Take a pinch of snuff
noverb:  Doctor
active:  acknowledge
active:  I have scored over
noverb:  you in your example
active:  He held out his snuffbox of old gold
noverb:  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
active:  Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life
active:  I could not help
active:  commenting upon it
noverb:  Ah
active:  said he
active:  I forgot
active:  I had not seen you for some weeks
active:  It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
noverb:  And the ring
active:  I asked
active:  glancing at a remarkable brilliant
active:  sparkled upon his finger
active:  It was from the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  the matter in
active:  I served
active:  them was of such delicacy
active:  I cannot confide it even to you
active:  have been good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my little problems
active:  And have you any on hand just now
active:  I asked with interest
noverb:  Some ten
noverb:  twelve
noverb:  none
active:  present any feature of interest
active:  They are important
active:  you understand
novoice: being
active:  interesting
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I have found
active:  it is usually in unimportant matters
active:  there is a field
noverb:  for the observation
noverb:  for the quick analysis of cause and effect
active:  gives the charm to an investigation
active:  The larger crimes are apt
active:  to be the simpler
noverb:  for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive
noverb:  In these cases
noverb:  save for one rather intricate matter
passive: has been referred to me from Marseilles
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  which presents any features of interest
active:  It is possible
noverb:  , however,
active:  I may have something
active:  better
active:  very many minutes are over
active:  for this is one of my clients
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  He had risen from his chair
active:  was standing
active:  between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street
noverb:  Looking over his shoulder
active:  I saw
noverb:  on the pavement opposite
active:  there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa
active:  round her neck
noverb:  a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat
passive: was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear
noverb:  From under this great panoply
active:  she peeped up in a nervous
noverb:  hesitating fashion at our windows
active:  her body oscillated backward and forward
novoice: her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  with a plunge
noverb:  as of the swimmer
active:  leaves the bank
active:  she hurried across the road
active:  we heard the sharp clang of the bell
active:  I have seen those symptoms before
active:  said Holmes
active:  throwing his cigarette into the fire
active:  Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
active:  She would like advice
active:  is not sure
active:  the matter is not too delicate for communication
noverb:  And
noverb:  even here we may discriminate
passive: When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man
active:  she no longer oscillates
active:  the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
noverb:  Here we may take it
active:  there is a love matter
active:  the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
novoice: grieved
noverb:  here she comes in person
active:  to resolve our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was a tap
noverb:  at the door
passive: the boy in buttons entered
active:  to announce Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  the lady
active:  herself loomed behind his small black figure
noverb:  a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat
active:  Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
active:  he was remarkable
noverb:  ,
active:  having closed the door
novoice: bowed her into an armchair
active:  he looked her over in the minute
noverb:  abstracted fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  Do you not find
active:  he said
noverb:  with your short sight
active:  it is a little
active:  trying
active:  to do so much typewriting
active:  I did at first
active:  she answered
active:  now I know
active:  the letters are without looking
active:  suddenly realising the full purport of his words
active:  she gave a violent start
active:  looked up
noverb:  with fear and astonishment upon her broad
noverb:  good-humoured face
noverb:  You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes
active:  she cried
noverb:  else
active:  could you know all that
noverb:  Never mind
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  it is my business
active:  to know things
active:  Perhaps I have trained myself
active:  to see
active:  others overlook
noverb:  not
active:  should you come to consult me
active:  I came to
noverb:  you
noverb:  sir
active:  I heard of
noverb:  you from Mrs. Etherege
active:  husband you found
noverb:  easy
noverb:  the police
active:  everyone had given him up for dead
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I wish
active:  you would do as much for me
noverb:  I'm not rich
active:  still I have a hundred a year in my own right
noverb:  besides the little
active:  I make by the machine
active:  I would give it all
active:  to know
active:  has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  his eyes to the ceiling
active:  Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  Yes
active:  I did bang out of the house
active:  she said
active:  for it made me angry
active:  to see the easy way in
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  that is
noverb:  my father
active:  took it all
active:  He would not go to the police
active:  he would not go to
noverb:  you
noverb:  at last
noverb:  as he would do nothing
active:  kept
active:  saying
active:  there was no harm
passive: done
novoice: it made me mad
noverb:  I just on with my things
active:  came right away to you
noverb:  Your father
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  your stepfather, surely,
active:  the name is different
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  my stepfather
noverb:  I call him father
active:  it sounds funny, too, for
active:  he is only five years
noverb:  two months older
noverb:  than myself
active:  And your mother is alive
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  mother is alive and well
noverb:  I wasn't best pleased
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  she married again
noverb:  soon after father's death
noverb:  a man
noverb:  who was nearly fifteen years younger
noverb:  than herself
active:  Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road
active:  he left a tidy business behind him
novoice: mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman
active:  Mr. Windibank came
noverb:  he made her sell the business
noverb:  for
active:  he was very superior
noverb:  , being a traveller in wines
active:  They got $4700 for the goodwill
noverb:  interest
noverb:  wasn't near
active:  father could have got
active:  he had been alive
active:  I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient
noverb:  under this rambling
noverb:  inconsequential narrative
active:  , on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
noverb:  Your own little income
active:  he asked
active:  does it come out of the business
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  It is quite separate
noverb:  and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland
active:  It is in New Zealand stock
noverb:  paying 4 1/4 per cent
active:  Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount
active:  I can only touch the interest
active:  You interest me extremely
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And
noverb:  you draw
noverb:  large a sum as a hundred a year
noverb:  with
active:  you earn into the bargain
noverb:  you no doubt travel a little
active:  indulge yourself in every way
active:  I believe
active:  a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60
active:  I could do with much less than
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you understand
active:  I live at home I don't wish
active:  to be a burden to them
active:  they have the use of the money just
active:  I am staying with them
noverb:  Of course
active:  that is only just for the time
active:  Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
noverb:  pays it over
active:  to mother
active:  I find
active:  I can do pretty well with
active:  I earn at typewriting
noverb:  It brings me twopence a sheet
active:  I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
active:  You have made your position very clear
noverb:  to me
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  Dr. Watson
active:  you can speak
noverb:  myself
noverb:  Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face
active:  she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
noverb:  I met him first at the gasfitters' ball
active:  she said
active:  They used to send father tickets
active:  he was alive
noverb:  ,
active:  afterwards they remembered us
active:  sent them
active:  to mother
active:  Mr. Windibank did not wish us
active:  to go
active:  He never did wish us
active:  to go anywhere
active:  He would get quite mad
active:  I wanted
active:  to join a Sunday-school treat
noverb:  this time
passive: I was set on going
active:  I would go
noverb:  for
active:  right had he
active:  to prevent
active:  He said
passive: the folk were not fit for us
active:  to know
noverb:  all father's friends were to be there
active:  And he said
active:  I had nothing
active:  fit
active:  to wear
active:  I had my purple plush
active:  I had never
noverb:  taken out of the drawer
noverb:  At last
active:  nothing else would do
active:  he went off to France upon the business of the firm
active:  we went
noverb:  mother
noverb:  I, with Mr. Hardy,
active:  used to be our foreman
active:  it was there
active:  I met Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I suppose
active:  said Holmes
active:  Mr. Windibank came back from France
active:  he was very annoyed
noverb:  at your having gone to the ball
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  well
active:  he was very good
noverb:  about it
active:  He laughed
active:  I remember
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  said
active:  there was no use
active:  denying anything to a woman
noverb:  for she would have her way
active:  I see
active:  at the gasfitters' ball
active:  you met
active:  I understand
active:  a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I met him
noverb:  night
active:  he called next day to ask
active:  we had got home all safe
noverb:  after
active:  we met him
active:  that is to say
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I met him twice for walks
active:  that father came back again
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any
noverb:  No
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know father didn't
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  He wouldn't have any visitors
active:  he could help it
active:  he used to say
active:  a woman should be happy in her own family circle
noverb:  as I used
active:  to say
active:  to mother
active:  a woman wants her own circle
active:  to begin with
active:  I had not got mine
noverb:  about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Did he make no attempt
active:  to see you
noverb:  Well,
active:  father was going off to France again in a week
active:  Hosmer wrote and said
noverb:  that it would be safer and better not
active:  to see each other
active:  he had gone
active:  We could write in the meantime
active:  he used to write every day
active:  I took the letters in in the morning
active:  there was no need
noverb:  for father
active:  to know
active:  Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: We were engaged after the first walk
active:  we took
noverb:  Hosmer
noverb:  Mr. Angel
active:  was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--
noverb:  office
active:  That's the worst of it
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  I don't know
active:  Where did he live
active:  He slept on the premises
noverb:  And you don't know his address
noverb:  No
active:  it was Leadenhall Street
active:  Where did you address your letters
noverb:  To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
passive: to be left till called for
active:  He said
passive: they were sent to the office
passive: he would be chaffed by all the other clerks
active:  having letters from a lady
active:  I offered to typewrite them
noverb:  like he did his
noverb:  he wouldn't have
noverb:  for he said
active:  I wrote them
active:  they seemed
active:  to come from me
active:  they were typewritten
active:  he always felt
active:  the machine had come between us
active:  That will just show you
noverb:  fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things
active:  he would think of
active:  It was most suggestive
active:  said Holmes
active:  It has
active:  long been an axiom of mine
active:  the little things are infinitely the most important
active:  Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes
active:  He would rather walk with me in the evening
noverb:  in the daylight
noverb:  for he said
passive: he hated
active:  to be conspicuous
noverb:  Very retiring
noverb:  gentlemanly he was
active:  Even his voice was gentle
active:  He'd had the quinsy
active:  swollen glands
active:  he was young
noverb:  , he told me
active:  it had left him with a weak throat
noverb:  a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech
active:  He was always well
noverb:  dressed
noverb:  very neat and plain
active:  his eyes were weak
noverb:  just
active:  mine are
active:  he wore tinted glasses against the glare
noverb:  Well,
novoice: happened
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  your stepfather
active:  returned to France
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again
active:  proposed
active:  we should marry
active:  father came back
active:  He was in dreadful earnest
noverb:  made me swear
noverb:  with my hands on the Testament
novoice: happened
active:  I would always be true to him
active:  Mother said
active:  he was quite right
noverb:  to make me swear
active:  it was a sign of his passion
active:  Mother was all in his favour from the first
active:  was even fonder of him
active:  I was
active:  they talked
active:  marrying within the week
active:  I began
active:  to ask about father
noverb:  they
passive: said never
active:  to mind about father
noverb:  just
active:  to tell him afterwards
active:  mother said
active:  she would make it all right with him
noverb:  I didn't quite
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  It seemed funny
active:  I should ask his leave
active:  he was only a few years older
noverb:  than me
noverb:  I didn't want
active:  to do anything on the sly
active:  I wrote
active:  to father at Bordeaux
active:  the company has its French offices
active:  the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
active:  It missed him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  for he had started to England just
active:  it arrived
noverb:  Ha!
active:  was unfortunate
passive: Your wedding was arranged
noverb:  for the Friday
active:  Was it
active:  to be in church
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  very quietly
active:  It was
active:  to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross,
active:  we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel
active:  Hosmer came for us in a hansom
active:  there were two of us
active:  he put us
noverb:  into it
active:  stepped himself into a four-wheeler
active:  happened to be the only other cab in the street
active:  We got to the church first
active:  the four-wheeler drove up
active:  we waited for him
active:  to step out
active:  he never did
active:  the cabman got down from the box
active:  looked
active:  there was no one
noverb:  there
active:  The cabman said
active:  he could not imagine
active:  had become of him
noverb:  for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
active:  That was last Friday
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I have never seen or heard anything
active:  to throw any light upon
active:  became of him
active:  It seems to me
active:  you have been very shamefully treated
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  He was too good and kind
active:  to leave me
noverb:  all the morning
active:  he was saying to me
novoice: happened
active:  I was to be true
noverb:  and
noverb:  even
noverb:  something quite unforeseen occurred
active:  to separate us
active:  I was always to remember
passive: I was pledged to him
active:  he would claim his pledge sooner
noverb:  later
active:  It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning
active:  has happened
active:  gives a meaning to it
active:  Most certainly it does
active:  Your own opinion is
active:  some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I believe
active:  he foresaw some danger
active:  else he would not have talked
active:  And then I think
active:  he foresaw
novoice: happened
active:  you have no notion as to
active:  it could
passive: have been
noverb:  None
noverb:  One
noverb:  question
noverb:  did your mother take the matter
active:  She was angry
noverb:  ,
active:  said
noverb:  that I was never to speak of the matter again
noverb:  And your father
active:  Did you tell him
noverb:  Yes
active:  and he seemed
active:  to think, with me, that something
active:  had happened
active:  I should hear of Hosmer again
noverb:  As he said
noverb:  interest could anyone have
active:  bringing me to the doors of the church
active:  leaving me
noverb:  Now,
active:  he had borrowed my money
active:  he had married me
active:  got my money
novoice: settled on him
active:  there might be some reason
active:  Hosmer was very independent about money
active:  never would look at a shilling of mine
noverb:  And
active:  could have happened
noverb:  And
active:  could he not write
noverb:  Oh
active:  it drives me half-mad
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  I can't sleep a wink at night
active:  She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff
active:  began
active:  to sob heavily into it
active:  I shall glance into the case for you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  rising
active:  and I have no doubt
active:  we shall reach some definite result
active:  Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now
active:  do not let your mind
active:  dwell upon it further
noverb:  Above all
active:  try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory
active:  he has done from your life
noverb:  you don't think I'll see him again
active:  I fear not
active:  has happened to him
active:  You will leave
noverb:  question in my hands
active:  I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his
active:  you can spare
active:  I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle
active:  said she
active:  Here is the slip
active:  here are four letters from him
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And your address
noverb:  No
noverb:  31 Lyon Place
noverb:  Camberwell
noverb:  Mr. Angel's address
active:  you never had
active:  I understand
active:  Where is your father's place of business
active:  He travels for Westhouse & Marbank
noverb:  the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street
active:  Thank you
active:  You have made your statement very clearly
active:  You will leave the papers here
noverb:  ,
active:  remember the advice
active:  I have given you
active:  Let
active:  the whole incident be a sealed book
active:  do not allow it
active:  to affect your life
active:  You are very kind
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  I cannot do that
active:  I shall be true
noverb:  to Hosmer
noverb:  He shall find me ready
active:  he comes back
noverb:  For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face
active:  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor
active:  compelled our respect
active:  She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table
active:  went her way
noverb:  with a promise
active:  to come again
passive: she might be summoned
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
passive: pressed together
novoice: his legs stretched out in front of him
noverb:  his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
active:  he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe
active:  was to him as a counsellor
active:  having lit it
active:  he leaned back in his chair
noverb:  with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him
noverb:  a look of infinite languor in his face
noverb:  Quite an interesting study
noverb:  that maiden
active:  he observed
active:  I found her more interesting
noverb:  her little problem
active:  , by the way, is rather a trite one
active:  You will find parallel cases
active:  you consult my index
noverb:  in Andover in '77
active:  there was something
noverb:  of the sort at The Hague last year
noverb:  Old
active:  is the idea, however,
active:  there were one or two details
active:  were new to me
noverb:  the maiden
active:  herself was most instructive
active:  You appeared to read a good deal upon her
active:  was quite invisible to me
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not invisible
noverb:  unnoticed
noverb:  Watson
active:  You did not know
active:  to look
active:  you missed all
active:  was important
active:  I can never bring you
active:  to realise the importance of sleeves
noverb:  the suggestiveness of thumb-nails
noverb:  the great issues
active:  may hang from a boot-lace
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  did you gather from that woman's appearance
active:  Describe it
noverb:  Well,
active:  she had a slate-coloured
noverb:  broad-brimmed straw hat
noverb:  with a feather of a brickish red
active:  Her jacket was black
noverb:  with black beads sewn upon it
noverb:  a fringe of little black jet ornaments
active:  Her dress was brown
noverb:  rather darker
active:  coffee colour
noverb:  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
active:  Her gloves were greyish
passive: were worn through at the right forefinger
noverb:  Her boots I didn't observe
active:  She had small round
noverb:  hanging gold earrings
noverb:  a general air
novoice: being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way
active:  Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together
novoice: chuckled
noverb:  Pon my word
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are coming along wonderfully
active:  You have really done very well indeed
active:  It is true
noverb:  that you have missed everything of importance
active:  you have hit upon the method
active:  you have a quick eye for colour
active:  Never trust
active:  to general impressions
noverb:  my boy
active:  concentrate yourself upon details
active:  My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve
noverb:  In a man
active:  it is perhaps better first
active:  to take the knee of the trouser
active:  you observe
active:  this woman had plush upon her sleeves
active:  is a most useful material for showing traces
active:  The double line a little above the wrist
noverb:  the typewritist presses against the table
passive: was beautifully defined
active:  The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark
noverb:  only on the left arm
noverb:  on the side of it farthest from the thumb
noverb:  instead
active:  being right across the broadest part
active:  this was
noverb:  I
novoice: glanced at her face
active:  observing the dint of a pince-nez at
noverb:  side of her nose
active:  I ventured a remark upon short sight
noverb:  typewriting
active:  seemed to surprise her
active:  It surprised me
noverb:  , surely,
active:  it was obvious
active:  I was
noverb:  much surprised
novoice: interested
active:  glancing down
active:  to observe
noverb:  the boots
active:  she was wearing
active:  were not unlike each other
active:  they were really odd ones
active:  the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap
noverb:  the other a plain one
passive: One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
noverb:  the other at the first, third
noverb:  fifth
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  a young lady
noverb:  neatly dressed
active:  has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned
active:  it is no great deduction
active:  to say
active:  she came away in a hurry
noverb:  And
noverb:  else
active:  I asked
noverb:  keenly interested
noverb:  as I always was
noverb:  by my friend's incisive reasoning
active:  I noted, in passing,
active:  she had written a note
noverb:  leaving home
passive: being fully dressed
active:  You observed
passive: her right glove was torn at the forefinger
active:  you did not apparently see
noverb:  glove
passive: finger were stained with violet ink
active:  She had written in a hurry
active:  dipped her pen too deep
active:  It must have been this morning
active:  the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
noverb:  All this is amusing
noverb:  rather elementary
active:  I must go back to business
noverb:  Watson
active:  Would you mind
noverb:  reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I held the little
active:  printed slip to the light
noverb:  Missing
active:  it said
noverb:  on the morning of the fourteenth
active:  a gentleman named Hosmer Angel
noverb:  About five ft

noverb:  with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots
active:  Known
passive: to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street
noverb:  Anybody bringing
active:  That will do
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  As to the letters
active:  he continued
active:  glancing over them
active:  they are very commonplace
noverb:  Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel
noverb:  save
active:  he quotes Balzac once
active:  There is one remarkable point, however,
active:  will no doubt strike you
active:  They are typewritten
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not only
active:  the signature is typewritten
noverb:  Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom
active:  There is a date
noverb:  you see
noverb:  no superscription
noverb:  Leadenhall Street
active:  is rather vague
active:  The point about the signature is very suggestive
noverb:  in fact
active:  we may call it conclusive
noverb:  Of
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  is it possible you do not see
noverb:  strongly it bears upon the case
active:  I cannot say
active:  I do
active:  it were
active:  he wished to be able
active:  to deny his signature
passive: an action for breach of promise were instituted
noverb:  No
active:  that was not the point
noverb:  However,
active:  I shall write two letters
active:  should settle the matter
active:  One is to a firm in the City
active:  the other is
active:  to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him
noverb:  he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening
active:  It is just as well
active:  we should do business with the male relatives
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we can do nothing until the answers to those letters
active:  come
active:  we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
active:  I had had so many reasons
active:  to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning
noverb:  extraordinary energy in action
active:  I felt
active:  he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with
active:  he treated the singular mystery
passive: he had been called upon
active:  to fathom
active:  Once only had I known him
active:  to fail
noverb:  in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph
active:  I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four
novoice: the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet
active:  I felt
active:  it would be a strange tangle indeed
active:  he could not unravel
active:  I left him
active:  still puffing at his black clay pipe
noverb:  with the conviction
active:  I came again on the next evening
active:  I would find
active:  he held in his hands all the clues
active:  would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
active:  A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time
noverb:  the whole of next day
active:  I was busy
noverb:  at the bedside of the sufferer
active:  It was not until close upon six o'clock
active:  I found myself free
active:  was able
active:  to spring into a hansom
noverb:  drive to Baker Street
noverb:  half afraid
active:  I might be too late
active:  to assist at the denouement of the little mystery
active:  I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
noverb:  A formidable array of bottles
noverb:  test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me
active:  he had spent his day in the chemical work
active:  was so dear to him
noverb:  Well,
passive: have
active:  you solved it
active:  I asked
active:  I entered
noverb:  Yes
active:  It was the bisulphate of baryta
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the mystery
active:  I cried
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  that
active:  I thought of the salt
active:  I have been working upon
active:  There was never any mystery
noverb:  in the matter, though, as I said yesterday
active:  some of the details are of interest
active:  The only drawback is
active:  there is no law
active:  I fear
active:  that can touch the scoundrel
active:  was he
active:  was his object
active:  deserting Miss Sutherland
active:  The question was hardly out of my mouth
active:  Holmes had not yet opened his lips
active:  to reply
active:  we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
active:  This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  He has written to me
active:  to say
active:  he would be here
noverb:  at six
active:  Come in
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a sturdy
noverb:  middle-sized fellow
noverb:  some thirty years of age, clean-shaven
noverb:  sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner
noverb:  a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
active:  He shot a questioning glance at each of us
active:  placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard
novoice: with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
noverb:  Good-evening
noverb:  Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  this typewritten letter is from
noverb:  you
noverb:  in
active:  you made an appointment with me for six o'clock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am a little late
active:  I am not quite my own master
active:  you know
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter
noverb:  for I think
novoice: it is far
noverb:  better not
active:  to wash linen of the sort in public
active:  It was quite against my wishes
active:  she came
active:  she is a very excitable, impulsive girl
noverb:  as you may have noticed
passive: she is not easily controlled
active:  she has made up her mind on a point
noverb:  Of course
active:  I did not mind you
noverb:  much
passive: you are not connected with the official police
active:  it is not pleasant
noverb:  to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is a useless expense
noverb:  for
active:  could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  I will succeed
active:  discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Mr. Windibank gave a violent start
active:  dropped his gloves
passive: I am delighted
active:  to hear it
active:  he said
active:  It is a curious thing
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting
active:  they are quite new
noverb:  , no two of them write exactly alike
active:  Some letters get more worn
noverb:  others
noverb:  some wear only on one side
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you remark in this note of yours
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  in every case
active:  there is some little
active:  slurring over of the 'e
noverb:  a slight defect in the tail of the 'r
active:  There are fourteen other characteristics
noverb:  those are the more obvious
active:  We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it is a little worn
active:  our visitor answered
active:  glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
active:  And now I will show you
active:  is really a very interesting study
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Holmes continued
active:  I think
active:  writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation
active:  to crime
active:  It is a subject to
active:  I have devoted some little attention
active:  I have here four letters
active:  purport
active:  to come from the missing man
active:  They are all
active:  typewritten
noverb:  In each case
active:  not only are the 'e's' slurred
noverb:  the 'r's' tailless
active:  you will observe
noverb:  you care
noverb:  to use my magnifying lens
noverb:  the fourteen other characteristics to
active:  I have alluded
active:  are there as well
active:  Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair
active:  picked up his hat
active:  I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes
active:  he said
active:  you can catch the man
active:  catch him
noverb:  let me know
active:  you have done it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  said Holmes
active:  stepping over
active:  turning the key in the door
active:  I let
active:  you know
active:  I have caught him
noverb:  !
noverb:  shouted Mr. Windibank
noverb:  turning white to his lips
active:  glancing about him like a rat in a trap
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  it won't do
noverb:  really it won't
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  There is no possible
active:  getting out of it, Mr. Windibank
active:  It is quite too transparent
active:  it was a very bad compliment
active:  you said
active:  it was impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to solve
noverb:  simple a question
active:  That's right
active:  Sit down
noverb:  let us talk it over
active:  Our visitor collapsed into a chair
noverb:  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
noverb:  It
active:  it's not actionable
active:  he stammered
active:  I am very much
noverb:  afraid
active:  it is not
noverb:  between ourselves
noverb:  Windibank
active:  it was as cruel
noverb:  selfish
noverb:  heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came
noverb:  me
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  let me just run over the course of events
active:  you will contradict me
active:  I go wrong
active:  The man sat huddled up in his chair
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  like one
passive: is utterly crushed
active:  Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece
noverb:  leaning back with his hands in his pockets
active:  began talking
noverb:  rather to himself
novoice: it seemed
noverb:  to us
active:  The man married a woman very much older
noverb:  himself for her money
active:  said he
active:  and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter
active:  she lived with them
active:  It was a considerable sum
noverb:  for people in their position
active:  the loss of it would have made a serious difference
active:  It was worth
noverb:  an effort
active:  to preserve it
active:  The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition
noverb:  affectionate
noverb:  warm-hearted in her ways
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that with her fair personal advantages
noverb:  her little income
passive: she would not be allowed
active:  to remain single long
active:  Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year
active:  does her stepfather
active:  do to prevent it
active:  He takes the obvious course
active:  keeping her at home
active:  forbidding her
active:  to seek the company of people of her own age
active:  soon he found
active:  that would not answer forever
active:  She became restive
novoice: insisted upon her rights
active:  finally announced her positive intention
active:  going to a certain ball
active:  does her clever stepfather
active:  do
active:  He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
noverb:  than to his heart
active:  With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
active:  covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses
active:  masked the face with a moustache
noverb:  a pair of bushy whiskers
noverb:  sunk
noverb:  clear voice into an insinuating whisper
active:  doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight
active:  he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  keeps off other lovers by making love himself
active:  It was only a joke
noverb:  at first
active:  groaned our visitor
active:  We never thought
active:  she would have been
novoice: carried away
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  However that may be
active:  the young lady was very decidedly carried away
active:  having quite made up her mind
active:  her stepfather was in France
noverb:  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind
passive: She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions
passive: the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
active:  Then Mr. Angel began
active:  to call
active:  for it was obvious
noverb:  that the matter should be pushed
active:  it would go
active:  a real effect were to be produced
active:  There were meetings
noverb:  ,
noverb:  an engagement
active:  would finally secure the girl's affections
active:  turning towards anyone else
passive: the deception could not be kept up forever
active:  These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous
noverb:  The thing
active:  to do
active:  was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner
active:  it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind
active:  prevent her
active:  looking upon any other suitor for some time
active:  to come
active:  Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament
noverb:  hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
active:  James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland
active:  to be
novoice: bound to Hosmer Angel
noverb:  so uncertain as to his fate
noverb:  for ten years
active:  to come, at any rate,
active:  she would not listen to another man
noverb:  the church door
active:  he brought her
noverb:  as he could go no farther
noverb:  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
active:  stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler
noverb:  out at the other
active:  I think
active:  was the chain of events
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance
active:  Holmes had been talking
active:  he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
active:  It may be
active:  it may not
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  you are
noverb:  very sharp you ought to be sharp enough
active:  to know
active:  it is you
active:  are breaking the law now
noverb:  not me
active:  I have done nothing actionable from the first
noverb:  ,
noverb:  you keep
active:  door locked
noverb:  you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
active:  The law cannot
active:  you say
active:  touch you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  unlocking and throwing open the door
noverb:  yet
active:  there never was a man
noverb:  who deserved punishment
active:  the young lady has a brother or a friend
active:  he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
noverb:  By Jove
active:  he continued
active:  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face
active:  it is not part of my duties
noverb:  to my client
noverb:  here's a hunting crop handy
noverb:  ,
active:  I think
active:  I shall just treat myself to
active:  He took two swift steps to the whip
active:  he could grasp it
active:  there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
novoice: the heavy hall door banged
noverb:  from the window
active:  we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
active:  There's a cold-blooded scoundrel
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  he threw himself down into his chair once
active:  That fellow will rise from crime to crime
active:  he does something very bad
noverb:  ,
noverb:  ends on a gallows
active:  The case has
active:  , in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest
active:  I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  of course
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct
active:  it was equally clear
noverb:  that the only man
passive: really profited by the incident
active:  we could see
active:  was the stepfather
noverb:  the fact
active:  the two men were never together
novoice: the one always appeared
active:  the other was away
active:  was suggestive
active:  So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
novoice: hinted at a disguise
active:  did the bushy whiskers
active:  My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action
active:  typewriting his signature
active:  , of course, inferred
active:  his handwriting was so familiar to her
active:  she would recognise even the smallest sample of it
active:  You see all these isolated facts
noverb:  together with many minor ones
noverb:  all pointed in the same direction
noverb:  And
active:  did you verify them
active:  Having once spotted my man
active:  it was easy
active:  to get corroboration
active:  I knew the firm for
active:  this man worked
active:  Having taken the printed description
active:  I eliminated everything from it
active:  could be the result of a disguise
noverb:  the whiskers, the glasses, the voice
active:  I sent it to the firm
noverb:  with a request
active:  they would inform me
active:  it answered to the description of any of their travellers
active:  I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter
noverb:  I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him
active:  he would come here
active:  As I expected
active:  his reply was typewritten
active:  revealed the same trivial
noverb:  characteristic defects
noverb:  The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street,
active:  to say
active:  the description tallied in every respect with
noverb:  of their employe, James Windibank
noverb:  Voila tout
noverb:  And Miss Sutherland
noverb:  I tell her she will not believe me
active:  You may remember the old Persian
active:  saying
active:  There is danger
noverb:  for him
noverb:  taketh the tiger cub
noverb:  danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman
active:  There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace
noverb:  as much knowledge of the world
noverb:  ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
passive: We were seated at breakfast one morning
noverb:  my wife and I
active:  the maid brought in a telegram
active:  It was from Sherlock Holmes
active:  ran in this way
active:  Have you a couple of days
active:  to spare
passive: Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy

noverb:  Air and scenery perfect
noverb:  Leave Paddington by the 11
noverb:  15
active:  do you say
noverb:  dear
active:  said
noverb:  my wife
noverb:  looking across at me
active:  Will you go
noverb:  I really don't know
active:  to say
active:  I have a fairly long list at present
noverb:  Oh
active:  Anstruther would do your work for you
active:  You have been looking a little pale lately
active:  I think
noverb:  the change would do you good
active:  you are always
noverb:  interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases
active:  I should be ungrateful
noverb:  if I were not
noverb:  seeing
active:  I gained through one of them
active:  I answered
active:  I am to go
active:  I must pack at once
noverb:  for I have only half an hour
active:  My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
noverb:  making me a prompt and ready traveller
active:  My wants were few and simple
noverb:  in less than the time stated
active:  I was in a cab with my valise
noverb:  rattling away to Paddington Station
active:  Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform
noverb:  his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter
noverb:  taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap
active:  It is really very good
noverb:  of you
active:  to come
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes a considerable difference to me
active:  having someone with me on
active:  I can thoroughly rely
active:  Local aid is always
noverb:  worthless
novoice: else biassed
active:  you will keep the two corner seats
active:  I shall get the tickets
noverb:  We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
active:  Holmes had brought with him
noverb:  Among these he rummaged and read
noverb:  with intervals of note-taking and of meditation
active:  we were past Reading
active:  he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball
active:  tossed them up onto the rack
active:  Have you heard anything of the case
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not a word
active:  I have not seen a paper for some days
active:  The London press has not had very full accounts
active:  I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order
active:  to master the particulars
active:  It seems
noverb:  from
active:  I gather
active:  to be one of those simple cases
active:  are
noverb:  extremely difficult
active:  That sounds a little paradoxical
active:  it is profoundly true
active:  Singularity is almost invariably a clue
noverb:  The more featureless
noverb:  commonplace a crime is
noverb:  the more difficult it is to bring it home
active:  In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
active:  It is a murder
noverb:  Well,
passive: it is conjectured
active:  to be
active:  I shall take nothing for granted
active:  I have the opportunity of looking personally into it
active:  I will explain the state of things to you

active:  following him
active:  they found
active:  the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool
passive: The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon
active:  The injuries were
active:  might very well
passive: have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun
passive: was found
active:  lying on the grass within a few paces of the body
active:  Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested
noverb:  a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday
passive: he was on Wednesday brought
noverb:  the magistrates at Ross
active:  have referred the case to the next Assizes
noverb:  Those are the main facts of the case
active:  they came out
noverb:  the coroner and the police-court
active:  I could hardly imagine a more damning case
active:  I remarked
active:  circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal
active:  it does
noverb:  here
active:  Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing
active:  answered Holmes thoughtfully
active:  It may seem to point very straight to one thing
noverb:  you shift your own point of view a little
active:  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
passive: It must be confessed, however,
active:  the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man
active:  it is very possible
noverb:  that he is indeed the culprit
active:  There are several people in the neighbourhood, however,
noverb:  among them Miss Turner
noverb:  the daughter of the neighbouring landowner
active:  believe in his innocence
active:  have retained Lestrade
active:  you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet
active:  to work out the case in his interest
noverb:  Lestrade
passive: being rather puzzled
active:  has referred the case to me
active:  hence it is
active:  two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
active:  I am afraid
active:  said I
active:  the facts are so obvious
active:  you will find little credit
passive: to be gained out of this case
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more deceptive
noverb:  an obvious fact
active:  he answered
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Besides
active:  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
active:  may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade
active:  You know me too well
active:  to think
active:  I am boasting
active:  I say
active:  I shall
active:  confirm or destroy his theory by means
active:  he is quite incapable
noverb:  of employing
noverb:  even of understanding
active:  To take the first example
active:  to hand
noverb:  I very clearly perceive
active:  in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side
active:  I question
active:  Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  I know you well
active:  I know the military neatness
noverb:  characterises you
active:  You shave every morning
noverb:  in this season you shave by the sunlight
active:  your shaving is less and less complete
active:  we get farther back on the left side
active:  it becomes positively slovenly
active:  we get round the angle of the jaw
active:  it is surely very clear
noverb:  that that side is less illuminated
noverb:  the other
active:  I could not imagine a man of your habits
active:  looking at himself in an equal light
passive: being satisfied with such a result
active:  I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
noverb:  Therein lies my metier
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that it may be of some service in the investigation
noverb:  lies
noverb:  us
active:  There are one or two minor points
passive: were brought out in the inquest
active:  are worth
active:  considering
active:  are they
active:  It appears
active:  his arrest did not take place at once
noverb:  after the return to Hatherley Farm
active:  On the inspector of constabulary informing him
active:  he was a prisoner
active:  he remarked
passive: he was not surprised
active:  to hear it
active:  it was no more than his deserts
noverb:  This observation of his had the natural effect
active:  removing any traces of doubt
active:  might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
active:  It was a confession
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  No
passive: for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
noverb:  Coming on the top of such a damning series of events
active:  it was at least a most suspicious remark
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes
active:  it is the brightest rift
noverb:  which I can at present see in the clouds
noverb:  However innocent he might be
active:  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not
active:  to see
active:  the circumstances were very black against him
active:  Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest
noverb:  feigned indignation at it
active:  I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious
noverb:  such surprise
active:  anger would not be natural under the circumstances
active:  might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
active:  His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
noverb:  an innocent man
noverb:  else as a man of considerable self-restraint
noverb:  firmness
noverb:  As to his remark about his deserts
active:  it was also not unnatural
noverb:  if you consider
active:  he stood beside the dead body of his father
active:  there is no doubt
noverb:  that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as
active:  to bandy words with him
noverb:  even
noverb:  according to the little girl
active:  evidence is so important
active:  to raise his hand as
active:  to strike him
noverb:  The self-reproach
noverb:  contrition
passive: are displayed
active:  in his remark appear to me
active:  to be the signs of a healthy mind rather
noverb:  of a guilty one
active:  I shook my head
passive: Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence
active:  I remarked
active:  they have
passive: And many men have been wrongfully hanged
active:  is the young man's own account of the matter
active:  It is
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , not very encouraging to his supporters
active:  there are one or two points in it
active:  are suggestive
noverb:  You will find it here
active:  may read it for yourself
active:  He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper
active:  having turned down the sheet
active:  he pointed out the paragraph in
active:  the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of
active:  had occurred
active:  I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage
active:  read
noverb:  it very carefully
active:  It ran in this way
active:  Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was
noverb:  called
active:  gave evidence
active:  follows
active:  I had been away from home for three days at Bristol
active:  had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday
noverb:  the 3rd
active:  My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival
passive: I was informed by the maid
active:  he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom
noverb:  Shortly after my return
active:  I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard
noverb:  looking out of my window
noverb:  I saw him get out
active:  walk rapidly out of the yard
active:  I was not aware
noverb:  in
noverb:  direction he was going
noverb:  I
active:  took my gun
active:  strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool
noverb:  with the intention
active:  visiting the rabbit warren
active:  is upon the other side
active:  On my way I saw William Crowder
noverb:  the game-keeper
active:  he had stated in his evidence
passive: he is mistaken
active:  thinking
active:  I was following my father
active:  I had no idea
active:  he was in front of me
active:  When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of
noverb:  Cooee
active:  was a usual signal between my father and myself
noverb:  I
noverb:  hurried forward
active:  found him standing by the pool
active:  He appeared
passive: to be much surprised
active:  seeing me
active:  asked me rather roughly
active:  I was doing there
active:  A conversation ensued
active:  led to high words
noverb:  almost to blows
active:  for my father was a man of a very violent temper
active:  Seeing
active:  his passion was becoming ungovernable
active:  I left him
active:  returned towards Hatherley Farm
active:  I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
active:  I heard a hideous outcry behind me
active:  caused me
active:  to run back again
active:  I found
active:  my father expiring upon the ground
noverb:  with his head terribly injured
active:  I dropped my gun
active:  held him in my arms
noverb:  he almost
noverb:  expired
active:  I knelt beside him for some minutes
active:  made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper
novoice: his house being the nearest
active:  to ask for assistance
active:  I saw no one near my father
active:  I returned
active:  I have no idea
active:  he came by his injuries
active:  He was not a popular man
active:  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners
active:  he had
active:  I know
noverb:  no active enemies
active:  I know nothing further of the matter
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  Did your father make any statement to you
active:  he died
noverb:  Witness
active:  He mumbled a few words
active:  I could only catch some allusion to a rat
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  did you understand by that
noverb:  Witness
active:  It conveyed no meaning to me
active:  I thought
active:  he was delirious
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was the point upon
noverb:  you
active:  your father had this final quarrel
noverb:  Witness
active:  I should prefer not
active:  to answer
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must press it
noverb:  Witness
active:  It is really impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to tell you
active:  I can assure you
active:  it has nothing
active:  to do with the sad tragedy
active:  followed
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  That is for the court
active:  to decide
active:  I need
active:  not point out to you
noverb:  your refusal
active:  to answer
active:  will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings
active:  may arise
noverb:  Witness
active:  I must still refuse
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I understand
noverb:  the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
noverb:  Witness
active:  It was
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was it
active:  he uttered it
active:  he saw you
active:  he even knew
active:  you had returned from Bristol
noverb:  Witness (with considerable confusion)
active:  I do not know
noverb:  A Juryman
active:  Did you see nothing
active:  aroused your suspicions
active:  you returned
active:  hearing the cry
noverb:  found your father fatally injured
noverb:  Witness
noverb:  Nothing definite
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  do you mean
noverb:  Witness
active:  I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open
active:  I could think of nothing
noverb:  of my father
active:  Yet I have a vague impression
active:  I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
active:  It seemed to me
active:  to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort,
noverb:  a plaid perhaps
active:  When I rose from my father
active:  I looked round for it
passive: it was gone
active:  Do you mean
active:  it disappeared
active:  you went for help
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was gone
active:  You cannot say
active:  it was
noverb:  No
active:  I had
active:  a feeling something was there
noverb:  far from the body
noverb:  A dozen yards
noverb:  And
noverb:  far from the edge of the wood
noverb:  About the same
passive: it was removed
active:  it was
active:  you were within a dozen yards of it
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  with my back towards it
noverb:  This concluded the examination of the witness
active:  I see
active:  said I
active:  I glanced down the column
active:  the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy
active:  He calls attention
noverb:  with reason
active:  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him
active:  seeing him
noverb:  also to his refusal
active:  to give details of his conversation with his father
noverb:  his singular account of his father's dying words
active:  They are all
noverb:  , as he remarks
noverb:  very much against the son
active:  Holmes laughed softly to himself
active:  stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
noverb:  you
active:  the coroner have been at some pains
active:  said he
active:  to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
noverb:  Don't you see
noverb:  you alternately give him credit
active:  having too much imagination
noverb:  too little
noverb:  Too little
active:  he could not invent a cause of quarrel
noverb:  would give him the sympathy of the jury
noverb:  too much
active:  he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat
noverb:  the incident of the vanishing cloth
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I shall approach this case from the point of view
active:  this young man says
active:  is true
active:  we shall see whither
active:  hypothesis will lead us
active:  And now here is my pocket Petrarch
noverb:  not another word shall I say of this case
active:  we are on the scene of action
active:  We lunch at Swindon
active:  I see
active:  we shall be there
noverb:  in twenty minutes
active:  It was nearly four
noverb:  o'clock
noverb:  we at last
active:  passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley
noverb:  over the broad gleaming Severn
active:  found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross
noverb:  A lean, ferret-like man
noverb:  furtive
noverb:  sly-looking
active:  was waiting for us upon the platform
noverb:  In spite of the light brown dustcoat
noverb:  leather-leggings
active:  he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  recognising Lestrade
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
active:  With him we drove to the Hereford Arms
passive: a room had already been engaged for us
active:  I have ordered a carriage
active:  said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
active:  I knew your energetic nature
active:  you would not be happy
active:  you had been on the scene of the crime
active:  It was very nice and complimentary of you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
active:  Lestrade looked startled
active:  I do not quite follow
active:  he said
active:  is the glass
noverb:  Twenty-nine
active:  I see
noverb:  No wind
noverb:  not a cloud in the sky
active:  I have a caseful of cigarettes here
active:  need smoking
active:  the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
active:  I do not think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that I shall use the carriage to-night
active:  Lestrade laughed indulgently
active:  You have
noverb:  no doubt
active:  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
active:  he said
active:  The case is
noverb:  a pikestaff
noverb:  the more one goes into it the plainer
active:  it becomes
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
noverb:  one can't refuse a lady
noverb:  such a very positive one
noverb:  too
active:  She has heard of
noverb:  you
active:  would have your opinion
novoice: I repeatedly told her
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  which you could do
active:  I had not already done
active:  bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door
active:  He had hardly spoken
active:  there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women
active:  I have
noverb:  seen in my life
noverb:  Her violet eyes shining
noverb:  her lips parted
noverb:  a pink flush upon her cheeks
active:  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  she cried
active:  glancing from one to the other of us
noverb:  finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion
active:  I am so glad
noverb:  that you have come
active:  I have driven down
active:  to tell you
active:  I know
noverb:  James didn't do it
active:  I know it
active:  I want you
active:  to start
active:  upon your work knowing it
noverb:  too
noverb:  Never let yourself doubt upon
noverb:  point
active:  We have known each other
active:  we were little children
active:  I know his faults as no one else
active:  does
active:  he is too tender-hearted
active:  to hurt a fly
active:  Such a charge is absurd to anyone
active:  really knows him
active:  I hope
active:  we may clear him, Miss Turner
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  You may rely upon my doing all
active:  I can
active:  you have read the evidence
active:  You have formed some conclusion
active:  Do you not see some loophole, some flaw
noverb:  Do you not yourself think
active:  he is innocent
active:  I think
active:  it is very probable
noverb:  There
noverb:  now
active:  she cried
active:  throwing
active:  back her head
noverb:  looking defiantly at Lestrade
active:  You hear
noverb:  He gives me hopes
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that my colleague has been a little quick
active:  forming his conclusions
active:  he said
active:  he is right
noverb:  Oh
active:  I know
active:  he is right
active:  James never did it
noverb:  And about his quarrel with his father
active:  I am sure
noverb:  the reason
active:  he would not speak
active:  about it to the coroner was
passive: I was concerned in
noverb:  it
noverb:  In
noverb:  way
active:  asked Holmes
active:  It is no time for me
active:  to hide anything
noverb:  James
active:  his father had many disagreements about me
active:  Mr. McCarthy was very anxious
active:  there should be a marriage
noverb:  between us
noverb:  James
active:  I have always loved each other as brother and sister
noverb:  of course
active:  he is young
noverb:  and has seen very little of life
noverb:  --and--well
active:  he naturally did not wish to do anything like
active:  there were quarrels
noverb:  this
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , was one of them
noverb:  And your father
active:  asked Holmes
active:  Was he in favour of such a union
noverb:  No
active:  he was averse
noverb:  to it also
noverb:  No one
active:  Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it
active:  A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen
active:  questioning glances at her
active:  Thank you for this information
active:  said he
active:  May I see your father
noverb:  I call to-morrow
noverb:  ?
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  the doctor won't allow it
noverb:  The doctor
noverb:  Yes
active:  have you not heard
active:  Poor father has never been strong for years back
active:  this has broken him down completely
active:  He has taken to his bed
active:  Dr. Willows says
noverb:  that he is a wreck
passive: his nervous system is shattered
active:  Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
noverb:  who had known dad in the old days in Victoria
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  In Victoria
active:  That is important
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  at the mines
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  at the gold-mines
active:  I understand
active:  Mr. Turner made his money
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  certainly
active:  Thank you, Miss Turner
active:  You have been of material assistance to me
active:  You will tell me
active:  you have any news to-morrow
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you will go to the prison
active:  to see James
noverb:  Oh
active:  you do
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  do tell him
active:  I know him
active:  to be innocent
active:  I will
noverb:  Miss Turner
active:  I must go home now
active:  for dad is very ill
active:  he misses me
active:  I leave him
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  God help you in your undertaking
active:  She hurried from the room
active:  she had entered
active:  we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
active:  I am ashamed
noverb:  of you, Holmes
active:  said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
active:  should you raise up hopes
passive: you are bound
active:  to disappoint
active:  I am not over-tender
noverb:  of heart
active:  I call it cruel
active:  I think
active:  I see my way
active:  to clearing James McCarthy
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Have you an order
active:  to see him in prison
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only for you and me
active:  I shall reconsider my resolution
active:  going out
active:  We have
active:  still time to take a train to Hereford
active:  see him to-night?
noverb:  Ample
noverb:  let us do
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
active:  you will find it very slow
active:  I shall only be away a couple of hours
active:  I walked down to the station with them
novoice: wandered through the streets of the little town
active:  finally returning to the hotel
active:  I lay upon the sofa
active:  tried
active:  to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel
active:  The puny plot of the story was so thin
noverb:  however
passive: compared to the deep mystery through
active:  we were groping
active:  I found
active:  my attention wander
noverb:  continually from the action to the fact
noverb:  I at last flung it across the room
active:  gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
noverb:  Supposing
active:  this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true
noverb:  hellish thing
noverb:  absolutely unforeseen
active:  extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time
active:  he parted from his father
noverb:  the moment
noverb:  drawn back by his screams
active:  he rushed into the glade
active:  It was something
noverb:  terrible and deadly
active:  could it be
active:  Might not the nature of the injuries
active:  reveal something to my medical instincts
active:  I rang the bell
active:  called for the weekly county paper
active:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest
passive: In the surgeon's deposition it was stated
noverb:  the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone
passive: had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
active:  I marked the spot upon my own head
passive: Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
active:  That was to some extent in favour of the accused
noverb:  as
noverb:  seen quarrelling
active:  he was face to face
noverb:  with his father
noverb:  Still,
active:  it did not go for very much
active:  for the older man might have turned his back
active:  the blow fell
noverb:  Still,
active:  it might be worth
noverb:  while
active:  to call Holmes' attention to it
active:  there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
active:  could
noverb:  mean
active:  It could not be delirium
noverb:  A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
noverb:  No
active:  it was more
noverb:  likely
active:  to be an attempt
active:  to explain
active:  he met his fate
active:  could it indicate
active:  I cudgelled my brains
active:  to find some possible explanation
active:  And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy
active:  were true the murderer
active:  must have dropped some part of his dress
noverb:  presumably his overcoat, in his flight,
active:  must have had the hardihood
active:  to return
active:  to carry it away at the instant
active:  the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
noverb:  a tissue of mysteries
noverb:  improbabilities the whole thing was
active:  I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion
active:  I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight
active:  I could not lose hope
novoice: every fresh fact seemed
active:  to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence
active:  It was late
active:  Sherlock Holmes returned
active:  He came back alone
active:  for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
noverb:  The glass still keeps very high
active:  he remarked as
active:  he sat down
active:  It is of importance
active:  it should not rain
active:  we are able
active:  to go over the ground
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  a man should be at his very best
noverb:  keenest for such nice work as
active:  I did not wish to do it
novoice: fagged by a long journey
active:  I have seen young McCarthy
noverb:  And
active:  did you learn from him
noverb:  Nothing
active:  Could he throw no light
noverb:  None at all
passive: I was inclined
active:  to think at one time
active:  he knew
active:  had done it
active:  was screening him
noverb:  her
passive: I am convinced now
active:  he is
noverb:  everyone else
active:  He is not a very quick-witted youth
noverb:  comely
active:  to look at
active:  I should think
noverb:  sound at heart
active:  I cannot admire his taste
active:  I remarked
active:  it is indeed a fact
noverb:  that he was averse
noverb:  to a marriage with
active:  charming a young lady as this Miss Turner
noverb:  Ah
active:  thereby hangs a rather painful tale
active:  This fellow is madly
noverb:  insanely
noverb:  in love with her
noverb:  some two years ago
active:  he was only a lad
active:  he really knew her
noverb:  for she had been away five years at a boarding-school
active:  does the idiot
active:  do
active:  get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol
active:  marry her at a registry office
active:  No one knows a word of the matter
active:  you can imagine
active:  maddening
active:  it must be to him
active:  to be upbraided for not doing
active:  he would give his very eyes
active:  to do
active:  he knows to be absolutely impossible
active:  It was sheer frenzy of this sort
noverb:  made him throw his hands up into the air
active:  his father, at their last interview, was goading him on
active:  to propose to Miss Turner
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he had no means
active:  supporting himself
noverb:  his father
active:  was by all accounts a very hard man
active:  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
active:  It was with his barmaid wife
active:  he had spent the last three days in Bristol
active:  his father did not know
active:  he was
noverb:  Mark
active:  point
active:  It is of importance
active:  Good has come out of evil
noverb:  however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
active:  he is in serious trouble
noverb:  likely
passive: to be hanged
active:  has thrown him over utterly
active:  has written to him
active:  to say
active:  she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
active:  there is really no tie
noverb:  between them
active:  I think
active:  bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
active:  he has suffered
active:  he is innocent
noverb:  ,
active:  has done it
noverb:  Ah!
active:  I would call your attention very particularly to two points
active:  One is
active:  the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool
active:  the someone could not have been his son
active:  for his son was away
active:  he did not know
active:  he would return
active:  The second is
passive: the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee
active:  he knew
active:  his son had returned
noverb:  Those are the crucial points upon
active:  the case depends
noverb:  And now let us talk about George Meredith
noverb:  you
active:  we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
active:  There was no rain
active:  Holmes had foretold
noverb:  the morning broke bright
noverb:  cloudless
noverb:  At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage
active:  we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
active:  There is serious news this morning
active:  Lestrade observed
active:  It is said
active:  Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill
passive: his life is despaired of
noverb:  An elderly man
active:  I presume
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  About sixty
passive: his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad
active:  he has been in failing health for some time
active:  This business has had a very bad effect upon him
active:  He was an old friend of McCarthy's
active:  I may add
noverb:  a great benefactor to him
noverb:  for I have learned
noverb:  he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is interesting
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  In a hundred other ways
active:  he has helped him
noverb:  Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
noverb:  Really
active:  Does it not strike you as a little singular
noverb:  this McCarthy
active:  appears to have had little of his own
active:  to have been under such obligations to Turner
active:  should still talk
active:  marrying his son to Turner's daughter
active:  is
noverb:  presumably
noverb:  heiress to the estate
noverb:  in such a very cocksure manner
noverb:  as
active:  it were merely a case of a proposal
noverb:  and all else would follow
active:  It is the
noverb:  more strange
active:  we know that Turner
active:  himself was averse
noverb:  to the idea
active:  The daughter told us as much
active:  Do you not deduce something from that
active:  We have got to the deductions and the inferences
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  winking at me
active:  I find it hard enough
active:  to tackle facts
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  without flying away after theories and fancies
active:  You are right
active:  said Holmes demurely
active:  you do find it very hard
active:  to tackle the facts
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  I have grasped one fact
active:  you seem to find it difficult
active:  to get hold of
active:  replied Lestrade with some warmth
noverb:  And
active:  is
active:  That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior
active:  all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
noverb:  Well,
active:  moonshine is a brighter thing
noverb:  fog
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  But I am very much mistaken
active:  this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is it
active:  It was a widespread
noverb:  comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed
noverb:  with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
noverb:  The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys
noverb:  however
noverb:  gave it a stricken look
noverb:  as
noverb:  the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
active:  We called at the door
noverb:  the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots
active:  her master wore at the time of his death
noverb:  also a pair of the son's
noverb:  not the pair
active:  he had
passive: had
active:  Having measured these very carefully from seven
noverb:  eight different points
novoice: Holmes desired
passive: to be led to the court-yard
noverb:  from
noverb:  we all followed the winding track
active:  led to Boscombe Pool
passive: Sherlock Holmes was transformed
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon such a scent as this
noverb:  Men
active:  had only known the quiet thinker
active:  logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him
noverb:  His face flushed
noverb:  darkened
passive: His brows were drawn into two hard black lines
active:  his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
active:  His face was bent downward
noverb:  his shoulders bowed
noverb:  his lips compressed
novoice: the veins stood out
noverb:  whipcord in his long
noverb:  sinewy neck
active:  His nostrils seemed
active:  to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase
active:  his mind was
novoice: absolutely concentrated upon the matter
noverb:  him
noverb:  a question
noverb:  remark fell unheeded upon his ears
noverb:  at the
active:  only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply
noverb:  Swiftly
active:  silently he made his way along the track
active:  ran through the meadows
noverb:  by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool
active:  It was damp
noverb:  , marshy ground
active:  is all
noverb:  district
active:  there were marks of many feet
noverb:  upon the path
noverb:  amid the short grass
active:  bounded it on
noverb:  side
active:  Sometimes Holmes would hurry on
noverb:  sometimes stop dead
active:  once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  I walked behind him
noverb:  the detective indifferent
noverb:  contemptuous
active:  I watched my friend with the interest
active:  sprang from the conviction
passive: every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
noverb:  The Boscombe Pool
noverb:  is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across
active:  is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner
noverb:  Above the woods
active:  lined it upon the farther side
active:  we could see the red
noverb:  jutting pinnacles
active:  marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling
active:  On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick
noverb:  there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
active:  lined the lake
noverb:  Lestrade showed us the exact spot at
passive: the body had been found
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  so moist was the ground
active:  I could plainly see the traces
passive: had been left by the fall of the stricken man
noverb:  To Holmes
noverb:  as I could see by his eager face
active:  peering eyes
active:  very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass
active:  He ran round
noverb:  like a dog
active:  is picking up a scent
noverb:  turned upon my companion
active:  did you go into the pool for
active:  he asked
active:  I fished about with a rake
active:  I thought
active:  there might be some weapon or other trace
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut
active:  I have no time
active:  That left foot of
novoice: yours with its inward twist is all
noverb:  over the place
active:  A mole could trace it
noverb:  there
active:  it vanishes among the reeds
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  simple it would all have been had
active:  I been here
noverb:  before they came
noverb:  a herd of buffalo
novoice: wallowed all over it
active:  Here is
active:  the party with the lodge-keeper came
active:  they have covered all tracks for six
active:  eight feet round the body
active:  here are three separate tracks of the same feet
active:  He drew out a lens
active:  lay down upon his waterproof
active:  to have a better view
active:  talking all the time rather to himself
noverb:  to us
noverb:  These are young McCarthy's feet
active:  Twice he was walking
active:  once he ran swiftly
passive: the soles are deeply marked
noverb:  the heels hardly visible
active:  That bears out his story
active:  He ran
active:  he saw his father on the ground
active:  here are the father's feet
active:  he paced up and down
active:  is this
active:  It is the butt-end of the gun
active:  the son stood listening
noverb:  And this
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  ha
noverb:  have we here
noverb:  Tiptoes! tiptoes
noverb:  Square,
noverb:  too
noverb:  quite unusual boots
active:  They come
active:  they go
active:  they come again
noverb:  of course
active:  was for the cloak
active:  Now where did they come from
active:  He ran up and down
noverb:  sometimes losing
active:  sometimes finding the track
active:  we were well within the edge of the wood
noverb:  under the shadow of a great beech
noverb:  the largest tree in the neighbourhood
active:  Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this
active:  lay down once
noverb:  upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
active:  For a long time he remained there
noverb:  turning over the leaves
noverb:  dried sticks
active:  gathering up
novoice: seemed to me to be dust into an envelope
active:  examining with his lens not only the ground
noverb:  even the bark of the tree
active:  he could reach
active:  A jagged stone was lying among the moss
noverb:  this also he carefully examined and retained
active:  he followed a pathway through the wood
active:  he came to the highroad
passive: all traces were lost
active:  It has been a case of considerable interest
active:  he remarked
noverb:  returning to his natural manner
active:  I fancy
active:  this grey house on the right must be the lodge
active:  I think
active:  I will go in
active:  have a word with Moran
active:  perhaps write a little note
active:  Having done
active:  we may drive back to our luncheon
active:  You may walk to the cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you presently
active:  It was about ten minutes
active:  we regained our cab
active:  drove back into Ross
active:  Holmes still carrying with him the stone
active:  he had picked up in the wood
active:  This may interest you, Lestrade
active:  he remarked
active:  holding it out
passive: The murder was done with
noverb:  it
active:  I see no marks
active:  There are none
active:  do you know
active:  The grass was growing under
noverb:  it
active:  It had only lain there a few days
active:  There was no sign of a place whence
passive: it had been taken
active:  It corresponds with the injuries
active:  There is no sign of any other weapon
noverb:  And the murderer
noverb:  Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg
active:  wears thick-soled shooting-boots
noverb:  a grey cloak
noverb:  smokes Indian cigars
noverb:  uses a cigar-holder
noverb:  carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket
active:  There are several other indications
noverb:  these may be enough
active:  to aid us in our search
active:  Lestrade laughed
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am still a sceptic
active:  he said
active:  Theories are all very well
active:  we have
active:  to deal with a hard-headed British jury
noverb:  Nous verrons
active:  answered Holmes calmly
active:  You work your own method
active:  I shall work mine
active:  I shall be busy
noverb:  this afternoon
active:  shall probably return to London by the evening train
noverb:  And leave your case unfinished
noverb:  No
noverb:  finished
noverb:  the mystery
passive: It is solved
active:  was the criminal
noverb:  The gentleman
active:  I describe
active:  is he
active:  Surely it would not be difficult
active:  to find out
active:  This is not such a populous neighbourhood
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am a practical man
active:  he said
active:  and I really cannot undertake
active:  to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg
active:  I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard
noverb:  All right
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  I have given you the chance
active:  Here are your lodgings
noverb:  Good-bye
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
active:  I leave
active:  Having left Lestrade at his rooms
active:  we drove to our hotel
active:  we found lunch upon the table
active:  Holmes was silent
active:  buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face
noverb:  as one
active:  finds himself in a perplexing position
noverb:  Look here
noverb:  Watson
active:  he said
passive: the cloth was cleared
active:  just sit down in this chair
noverb:  let me preach to
noverb:  you for a little
noverb:  I don't know quite
active:  to do
active:  I should value your advice
active:  Light a cigar
noverb:  let me expound
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  now
active:  considering this case
active:  there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative
active:  struck us
active:  they impressed me in his favour and you against him
active:  One was the fact
active:  his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee
active:  seeing him
active:  The other was his singular dying reference to a rat
active:  He mumbled several words
active:  you understand
active:  was all
active:  caught the son's ear
noverb:  Now from this double point
active:  our research must commence
active:  we will begin it
active:  presuming
active:  the lad says
active:  is absolutely true
noverb:  of this 'Cooee
noverb:  Well,
passive: obviously it could not have been meant for the son
noverb:  The son
active:  he knew
active:  was in Bristol
active:  It was mere chance
active:  he was within earshot
noverb:  The 'Cooee
passive: was meant
active:  to attract the attention of whoever it was
active:  he had the appointment with
noverb:  But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry
noverb:  one
passive: is used between Australians
active:  There is a strong presumption
noverb:  that the person
novoice: McCarthy expected
active:  to meet
active:  him at Boscombe Pool was someone
noverb:  who had been in Australia
noverb:  of the rat
active:  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket
active:  flattened it out on the table
active:  This is a map of the Colony of Victoria
active:  he said
active:  I wired to Bristol for it last night
active:  He put his hand over part of the map
noverb:  do you read
noverb:  ARAT
active:  I read
noverb:  And now
active:  He raised his hand
noverb:  BALLARAT
noverb:  Quite
active:  That was the word
novoice: the man uttered
noverb:  of
noverb:  his son only caught the last two syllables
active:  He was trying to utter the name of his murderer
noverb:  of Ballarat
active:  It is wonderful
active:  I exclaimed
active:  It is obvious
noverb:  And now
noverb:  you see
active:  I had narrowed the field down considerably
active:  The possession of a grey garment was a third point
active:  granting the son's statement
active:  to be correct
active:  was a certainty
active:  We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  And one
active:  was at home in the district
passive: for the pool can only be approached by the farm
noverb:  by the estate
active:  strangers could hardly wander
noverb:  Quite
active:  comes our expedition of to-day
active:  By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details
active:  I gave to that imbecile Lestrade
noverb:  as to the personality of the criminal
active:  did you gain them
active:  You know my method
passive: It is founded upon the observation of trifles
noverb:  His height
active:  I know
active:  you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
noverb:  His boots
noverb:  too
active:  might be told from their traces
noverb:  Yes
active:  they were peculiar boots
noverb:  his lameness
active:  The impression of his right foot was always less distinct
noverb:  his left
active:  He put
noverb:  weight upon it
active:  he limped
active:  he was lame
noverb:  his left-handedness
noverb:  You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury
passive: recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
passive: The blow was struck from immediately behind
active:  was upon the left side
noverb:  Now,
active:  can
active:  be
active:  it were by a left-handed man
active:  He had stood behind
noverb:  tree during the interview between the father and son
active:  He had even smoked there
active:  I found the ash of a cigar
active:  my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me
active:  to pronounce as an Indian cigar
active:  I have
active:  you know
active:  devoted some attention to this
active:  written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco
active:  Having found the ash
noverb:  I
active:  looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
active:  he had tossed it
active:  It was an Indian cigar
noverb:  of the variety
passive: are rolled in Rotterdam
noverb:  And the cigar-holder?
active:  I could see
active:  the end had not been in his mouth
active:  Therefore he used a holder
passive: The tip had been cut off
active:  not bitten off
noverb:  the cut was not a clean one
active:  I deduced a blunt pen-knife
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I said
noverb:  you have drawn a net round this man from
active:  he cannot escape
active:  you have saved an innocent human life
active:  you had cut the cord
active:  was hanging him
active:  I see the direction in
noverb:  all this points
active:  The culprit is
noverb:  Mr. John Turner
active:  cried the hotel waiter
active:  opening the door of our sitting-room
active:  ushering in a visitor
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a strange and impressive figure
noverb:  His slow
noverb:  limping step
active:  bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude
noverb:  his hard, deep-lined, craggy features
active:  his enormous limbs showed
passive: he was possessed of unusual strength of body
noverb:  of character
noverb:  His tangled beard
noverb:  grizzled hair
noverb:  outstanding
active:  drooping eyebrows combined
active:  to give an air of dignity
noverb:  power to his appearance
active:  his face was of an ashen white
noverb:  his lips
passive: the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
active:  It was clear
noverb:  to me at a glance
active:  he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
active:  Pray
active:  sit down on the sofa
active:  said Holmes gently
active:  You had my note
noverb:  Yes
active:  the lodge-keeper brought it up
active:  You said
noverb:  you wished to see me here
active:  to avoid scandal
active:  I thought people
active:  would talk
active:  I went to the Hall
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you wish
active:  to see me
active:  He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes
noverb:  as
passive: his question was already answered
noverb:  Yes
active:  said Holmes
active:  answering the look rather
noverb:  the words
active:  It is
active:  I know all about McCarthy
active:  The old man sank his face in his hands
active:  God help me
active:  he cried
active:  But I would not have let the young man
active:  come
active:  to harm
noverb:  I give you my word
active:  I would have spoken out
active:  it went against him at the Assizes
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear
active:  you say
active:  said Holmes gravely
noverb:  I
active:  would have spoken now
active:  had it not been for my dear girl
active:  It would break her heart
active:  it will break her heart
active:  she hears
passive: I am arrested
active:  It may not come to that
active:  said Holmes
active:  I am no official agent
active:  I understand
active:  it was your daughter
noverb:  who required my presence here
active:  I am acting in her interests
active:  Young McCarthy must be
active:  got off
noverb:  however
active:  I am a dying man
active:  said old Turner
active:  I have had diabetes for years
active:  My doctor says
active:  it is a question
noverb:  whether I shall live a month
active:  Yet I would rather die under my own roof
noverb:  in a gaol
active:  Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper
noverb:  him
noverb:  Just tell us the truth
active:  he said
active:  I shall jot down the facts
active:  You will sign it
active:  Watson here can witness it
active:  Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity
active:  to save young McCarthy
active:  I promise you
active:  I shall not use it
passive: it is absolutely needed
active:  It's as well
active:  said the old man
active:  it's a question
active:  I shall live to the Assizes
active:  it matters little to me
active:  I should wish
noverb:  to spare Alice the shock
active:  And now I will make the thing clear
noverb:  to you
active:  it has been a long time in the acting
noverb:  will not take me long
active:  to tell
noverb:  You didn't know this dead man
noverb:  McCarthy
active:  He was a devil incarnate
noverb:  I tell you that
active:  God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he
active:  His grip has been upon me these twenty years
active:  he has blasted my life
noverb:  I'll tell you first
active:  I came
active:  to be in his power

active:  the inspector has formed the opinion
active:  the letters are all practical jokes
active:  the deaths of my relations were really accidents
novoice: as the jury stated
active:  were not
passive: to be connected with the warnings
active:  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
noverb:  Incredible imbecility
active:  he cried
active:  They have
noverb:  however
noverb:  allowed me a policeman
active:  may remain in the house with me
passive: Has
active:  he come with
noverb:  you to-night?
noverb:  No
active:  His orders were
active:  to stay in the house
active:  Again Holmes raved in the air
active:  did you come to me
active:  he cried
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  did you not come at once
active:  I did not know
active:  It was only to-day
noverb:  that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles
passive: was advised by him
active:  to come to
noverb:  you
active:  It is really two days
active:  you had the letter
active:  We should have acted
noverb:  this
active:  You have no further evidence
active:  I suppose
active:  you have placed
noverb:  us
noverb:  no suggestive detail
active:  might help us
active:  There is one thing
active:  said John Openshaw
active:  He rummaged in his coat pocket
active:  drawing out a piece
novoice: discoloured
noverb:  blue-tinted paper
active:  he laid it out upon the table
active:  I have some remembrance
active:  said he
noverb:  on the day
active:  my uncle burned the papers
active:  I observed
noverb:  the small, unburned margins
active:  lay
active:  amid the ashes were of this particular colour
active:  I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room
passive: I am inclined
active:  to think
active:  it may be one of the papers
active:  has
noverb:  perhaps
novoice: fluttered out from among the others
active:  in that way has escaped destruction
noverb:  Beyond the mention of pips
active:  I do not see
noverb:  it helps us much
active:  I think myself
active:  it is a page
noverb:  from some private diary
active:  The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's
active:  Holmes moved the lamp
noverb:  we
noverb:  bent over the sheet of paper
active:  showed by its ragged edge
passive: it had indeed been torn from a book
passive: It was headed
noverb:  March
noverb:  1869
noverb:  and
active:  were the following enigmatical notices
noverb:  4th
active:  Hudson came
noverb:  Same old platform
noverb:  7th
active:  Set the pips on McCauley
noverb:  Paramore
noverb:  John Swain
noverb:  of St. Augustine
noverb:  9th
active:  McCauley cleared
noverb:  10th
active:  John Swain cleared
noverb:  12th
noverb:  Visited Paramore
noverb:  All well
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  folding up the paper
active:  returning it to our visitor
active:  And now you must on no account lose another instant
active:  We cannot spare time even to discuss
active:  you have told me
active:  You must get home
noverb:  act
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  There is
noverb:  one thing
active:  to do
passive: It must be done at once
active:  You must put this piece of paper
active:  you have shown us into the brass box
active:  you have described
active:  You must also put in a note
active:  to say
passive: all the other papers were burned by your uncle
noverb:  this is the only one
noverb:  remains
active:  You must assert
noverb:  in such words
active:  will carry conviction with them
active:  Having done this
active:  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial
passive: directed
active:  Do you understand
noverb:  Entirely
active:  Do not think of revenge
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  at present
active:  I think
active:  we may gain
noverb:  by means of the law
active:  we have our web
active:  to weave
passive: theirs is already woven
active:  The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger
active:  threatens you
active:  The second is
active:  to clear up the mystery
active:  to punish the guilty parties
active:  I thank you
active:  said the young man
noverb:  rising
noverb:  pulling on his overcoat
active:  You have given me fresh life and hope
active:  I shall certainly do
active:  you advise
active:  Do not lose an instant
noverb:  And,
noverb:  above all
noverb:  take care of yourself in the meanwhile
noverb:  for I do not think
active:  there can be a doubt
noverb:  that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
active:  do you go back
noverb:  By train from Waterloo
active:  It is not
noverb:  nine
passive: The streets will be crowded
active:  I trust
active:  you may be in safety
noverb:  And
active:  you cannot guard yourself too closely
passive: I am armed
active:  That is well
active:  To-morrow I shall set
active:  to work upon your case
active:  I shall see you at Horsham
noverb:  No
noverb:  your secret lies in London
active:  It is there
noverb:  that I shall seek it
active:  I shall call upon
noverb:  you in a day
noverb:  in two days
noverb:  with news as to the box and the papers
active:  I shall take your advice in every particular
active:  He shook hands with us
active:  took his leave
novoice: Outside the wind still screamed
active:  the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
active:  This strange, wild story seemed
active:  to have come to us from amid the mad elements
noverb:  blown in upon us
noverb:  a sheet of sea-weed in a gale
noverb:  now
passive: to have
passive: been reabsorbed by them once
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence
noverb:  with his head sunk forward
active:  his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
active:  he lit his pipe
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  he watched the blue smoke-rings
noverb:  as they chased each other up to the ceiling
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  he remarked at last
noverb:  of all our cases
active:  we have had none more fantastic
noverb:  than this
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  the Sign of Four
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  that
noverb:  And
active:  this John Openshaw seems to me
active:  to be walking amid even greater perils
active:  did the Sholtos
active:  have you
active:  I asked
active:  formed any definite conception as to
active:  these perils are
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  as to their nature
active:  he answered
active:  are they
active:  is this K. K. K.
active:  does he pursue this unhappy family
active:  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes
active:  placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  The ideal reasoner
active:  he remarked
active:  would
active:  he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings
active:  deduce from it not only all the chain of events
novoice: led up to it
noverb:  also all the results
active:  would follow from
noverb:  it
active:  As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone
noverb:  the observer
active:  has thoroughly understood
active:  one link in a series of incidents should be able
active:  to accurately state all the other ones
noverb:  after
active:  We have not yet grasped the results
active:  the reason alone can attain to
passive: Problems may be solved in the study
active:  have baffled all those
active:  have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
active:  To carry the art
noverb:  however, to its highest pitch,
active:  it is necessary
noverb:  that the reasoner should be able
active:  to utilise all the facts
active:  have come to his knowledge
active:  and this in itself implies
noverb:  as you will readily see
noverb:  a possession of all knowledge
noverb:  even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias
active:  is a somewhat rare accomplishment
active:  It is not
noverb:  impossible
noverb:  however
active:  a man should possess all knowledge
active:  is likely
active:  to be useful to him in his work
noverb:  this
active:  I have endeavoured in my case
active:  to do
active:  If I remember rightly
active:  you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion
noverb:  Yes
active:  I answered
noverb:  laughing
active:  It was a singular document
noverb:  Philosophy
noverb:  astronomy
passive: politics were marked at zero
active:  I remember
noverb:  Botany variable
noverb:  geology profound as regards
noverb:  the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town
noverb:  chemistry eccentric
noverb:  anatomy unsystematic
noverb:  , sensational literature
noverb:  crime records unique, violin-player, boxer
noverb:  swordsman
noverb:  lawyer
noverb:  self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
noverb:  Those
active:  I think
active:  were the main points of my analysis
active:  Holmes grinned at the last item
noverb:  Well
active:  he said
active:  I say now
noverb:  as I said
active:  a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture
active:  he is likely
active:  to use
noverb:  the rest
active:  he can put away in the lumber-room of his library
active:  he can get it
active:  he wants it
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  for such a case as the one
passive: has been submitted to us to-night
active:  we need certainly to muster all our resources
noverb:  Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia
noverb:  stands upon the shelf beside you
active:  Thank you
noverb:  Now let us consider the situation
noverb:  see
passive: may be deduced from
noverb:  it
noverb:  In the first place
active:  we may start with a strong presumption
active:  Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America
active:  Men at his time of life do not change all their habits
noverb:  exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town
active:  His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea
active:  he was in fear of someone
noverb:  something
active:  we may assume as a working hypothesis
active:  it was fear of someone or something
noverb:  which drove him from America
noverb:  As to
noverb:  it was he feared
active:  we can only deduce
active:  considering the formidable letters
passive: were received by himself and his successors
active:  Did you remark the postmarks of those letters
active:  The first was from Pondicherry
noverb:  the second from Dundee
noverb:  the third from London
noverb:  From East London
active:  do you deduce from that
active:  They are all seaports
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We have already a clue
active:  There can be no doubt
noverb:  that the probability--the strong probability--is
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  And now let us consider another point
noverb:  In the case of Pondicherry
active:  seven weeks elapsed between the threat
noverb:  its fulfilment
noverb:  in Dundee
active:  it was only some three
noverb:  four days
active:  Does
active:  suggest anything
noverb:  A greater distance
active:  to travel
active:  the letter had also a greater distance
active:  to come
active:  I do not see the point
active:  There is at least a presumption
noverb:  that the vessel in
noverb:  the man
active:  men are
active:  is a sailing-ship
active:  It looks as
active:  they always send their singular warning
noverb:  token
noverb:  them
noverb:  starting upon their mission
active:  You see
active:  quickly the deed followed the sign
active:  it came from Dundee
active:  they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer
active:  they would have arrived almost
noverb:  their letter
active:  , as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed
active:  I think
active:  those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat
active:  brought the letter
noverb:  the sailing vessel
active:  brought the writer
active:  It is possible
noverb:  More than that
active:  It is probable
active:  And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case
active:  I urged young Openshaw
active:  to caution
active:  The blow has always fallen at the end of the time
active:  it would take the senders
active:  to travel the distance
active:  this one comes from London
active:  therefore we cannot count upon delay
noverb:  Good God
active:  I cried
active:  can it mean
noverb:  this relentless persecution
noverb:  The papers
active:  Openshaw carried
active:  are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship
active:  I think
active:  it is quite clear
noverb:  that there must be more than one of them
active:  A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as
active:  to deceive a coroner's jury
active:  There must have been several in it
active:  they must have been men of resource and determination
noverb:  Their papers they mean to have
active:  be the holder of them
active:  it may
active:  In this way you see K. K. K.
active:  ceases to be the initials of an individual
active:  becomes the badge of a society
noverb:  of
noverb:  society
active:  Have you never
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  bending forward
active:  sinking his voice
active:  have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan
active:  I never have
active:  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
noverb:  Here it is
active:  said he presently
noverb:  Ku Klux Klan
passive: A name derived
novoice: from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced
active:  cocking a rifle
active:  This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War
noverb:  it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country
noverb:  notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida
passive: Its power was used for political purposes
noverb:  principally for the terrorising of the negro voters
noverb:  the murdering and driving from the country of those
passive: were opposed to its views
passive: Its outrages were usually preceded
novoice: by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
noverb:  generally recognised shape
noverb:  a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts
noverb:  melon seeds
noverb:  orange pips in others
active:  receiving this the victim
active:  might
active:  openly abjure his former ways
active:  might fly from the country
active:  he braved the matter out
active:  death would unfailingly come upon him
noverb:  usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
active:  perfect was the organisation of the society
noverb:  so systematic its methods
active:  there is hardly a case
noverb:  upon record
novoice: any man succeeded in braving it with impunity
noverb:  in
passive: any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
active:  For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government
noverb:  of the better classes of the community in the South
noverb:  Eventually,
noverb:  in the year 1869
noverb:  the movement rather suddenly collapsed
active:  there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort
noverb:  date
active:  You will observe
active:  said Holmes
active:  laying down the volume
noverb:  the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers
active:  It may well
active:  have been cause and effect
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that he
active:  his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
active:  You can understand
noverb:  this register
active:  diary may implicate some of the first men in the South
active:  there may be many
noverb:  who will not sleep easy at night
passive: it is recovered
noverb:  the page
active:  we have seen
active:  Is such as
active:  we might expect
active:  It ran
active:  I remember right
active:  sent the pips to A
noverb:  B
noverb:  C
active:  that is
active:  sent the society's warning to them
active:  there are successive entries
noverb:  A
novoice: B cleared
active:  left the country
noverb:  finally
passive: C was visited
noverb:  with
active:  I fear
noverb:  a sinister result for C. Well
active:  I think
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we may let some light into this dark place
active:  I believe
active:  the only chance young Openshaw has
active:  in the meantime is to do
active:  I have told him
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more
passive: to be said
active:  to be done to-night
active:  hand me over my violin
noverb:  let us try
active:  to forget for half an hour the miserable weather
noverb:  the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
active:  It had cleared in the morning
active:  the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil
noverb:  hangs over the great city
active:  Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast
active:  I came down
active:  You will excuse me for not waiting for
noverb:  you
active:  said he
active:  I have
active:  I foresee
noverb:  a very busy day
noverb:  me
active:  looking into this case of young Openshaw's
noverb:  steps will you take
active:  I asked
active:  It will very much
active:  depend upon the results of my first inquiries
active:  I may have
active:  to go down to Horsham
noverb:  after all
noverb:  You will not go there first
noverb:  No
active:  I shall commence with the City
active:  Just ring the bell
active:  the maid will bring up your coffee
active:  I waited
active:  I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table
active:  glanced my eye over it
active:  It rested upon a heading
active:  sent a chill to my heart
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  you are too late
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  laying down his cup
active:  I feared as much
passive: was it done
active:  He spoke calmly
active:  I could see
passive: he was deeply moved
active:  My eye caught the name of Openshaw
noverb:  the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge
active:  Here is the account
noverb:  Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge
active:  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
noverb:  The night
noverb:  however
active:  was extremely dark and stormy
noverb:  in spite of the help of several passers-by
active:  it was quite impossible
active:  to effect a rescue
noverb:  The alarm
noverb:  however
active:  was given
noverb:  by the aid of the water-police
passive: the body was eventually recovered
active:  It proved to be
noverb:  of a young gentleman
noverb:  name
active:  it appears from an envelope
passive: was found in his pocket
active:  was John Openshaw
active:  residence is near Horsham
passive: It is conjectured
active:  he may have been hurrying down
active:  to catch the last train from Waterloo Station
noverb:  in his haste
noverb:  the extreme darkness
active:  he missed his path
active:  walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats
active:  The body exhibited no traces of violence
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
active:  should have the effect
active:  calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages
active:  We sat in silence for some minutes
noverb:  Holmes more depressed and shaken
noverb:  than I had ever seen him
active:  That hurts my pride, Watson
active:  he said at last
active:  It is a petty feeling
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it hurts my pride
active:  It becomes a personal matter with me now
noverb:  God sends me health
active:  I shall set my hand upon this gang
active:  he should come to me for help
active:  I should send him away to his death
noverb:  !
active:  He sprang from his chair
active:  paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
active:  They must be cunning devils
active:  he exclaimed at last
active:  could
active:  they have decoyed him down there
active:  The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station
noverb:  The bridge, no doubt
active:  was too crowded
noverb:  even on such a night
noverb:  for their purpose
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall see
active:  will win in the long run
active:  I am going out now
noverb:  To the police
noverb:  No
active:  I shall be my own police
active:  When I have spun the web
active:  they may take the flies
noverb:  not before
noverb:  All day
passive: I was engaged in my professional work
active:  it was late
noverb:  in the evening
active:  I returned to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes had not come back
active:  It was nearly ten
noverb:  o'clock
active:  he entered
noverb:  looking pale
noverb:  worn
active:  He walked up to the sideboard
active:  tearing a piece from the loaf
active:  he devoured it voraciously
active:  washing it down with a long draught of water
active:  You are hungry
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Starving
active:  It had escaped my memory
active:  I have had nothing
noverb:  breakfast
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Not a bite
active:  I had no time
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  And
active:  have you succeeded
noverb:  Well
active:  You have a clue
active:  I have them in the hollow of my hand
active:  Young Openshaw shall not long
active:  remain unavenged
noverb:  Watson
novoice: let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them
active:  It is well thought of
noverb:  do you mean
active:  He took an orange from the cupboard
active:  tearing it to pieces
active:  he squeezed out the pips upon the table
noverb:  Of these he took five
novoice: thrust them into an envelope
noverb:  On the inside of the flap
active:  he wrote
noverb:  S. H. for J. O.
active:  he sealed it
active:  addressed it to
noverb:  Captain James Calhoun
noverb:  Barque Lone Star
noverb:  Savannah, Georgia
active:  That will await him
active:  he enters port
active:  said he
active:  chuckling
noverb:  It may give him a sleepless night
active:  He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate
active:  Openshaw did
noverb:  him
noverb:  And
noverb:  who is this Captain Calhoun
noverb:  The leader of the gang
active:  I shall have the others
noverb:  he first
active:  did you trace it
active:  He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket
noverb:  all covered with dates and names
active:  I have spent the whole day
active:  said he
noverb:  over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers
active:  following the future career of every vessel
active:  touched at Pondicherry in January
noverb:  February in '83
active:  There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage
active:  were reported there during those months
noverb:  Of these
noverb:  one
noverb:  the Lone Star
active:  attracted my attention
passive: it was reported
active:  having cleared from London
active:  the name is
passive: is given to one of the states of the Union
noverb:  Texas
active:  I think
active:  I was not
active:  am not sure
active:  I knew
active:  the ship must have an American origin
active:  I searched the Dundee records
active:  I found
active:  the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85
active:  my suspicion became a certainty
noverb:  I
novoice: inquired as to the vessels
active:  lay at present in the port of London
noverb:  Yes
active:  The Lone Star had arrived here last week
active:  I went down to the Albert Dock

noverb:  she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning
noverb:  homeward bound to Savannah

active:  she is now past
noverb:  the Goodwins
noverb:  not very far from the Isle of Wight
active:  will
active:  you do
noverb:  Oh

active:  I know
noverb:  also
noverb:  they were all three away from the ship last night
active:  I had it from the stevedore
active:  has been loading their cargo
noverb:  By the time
noverb:  their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter
active:  the cable will have informed the police of Savannah
passive: these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
active:  There is
noverb:  a flaw
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the best laid of human plans
active:  the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips
active:  would show them
noverb:  another
noverb:  as cunning
noverb:  themselves
active:  was upon their track
noverb:  Very long
noverb:  very severe were the equinoctial gales that year
active:  We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah

noverb:  sensations
active:  he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
active:  to produce the same effects

noverb:  for

noverb:  a few hurried words
noverb:  quick steps upon the linoleum
active:  Our own door flew open
noverb:  a lady
active:  clad in some dark-coloured stuff
noverb:  with a black veil
active:  entered the room
active:  You will excuse my calling
noverb:  late
active:  she began
active:  suddenly losing her self-control
active:  she ran forward
active:  threw her arms about my wife's neck
novoice: sobbed upon her shoulder
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  I'm in such trouble
active:  she cried
active:  I do
noverb:  want a little help
active:  said my wife
novoice: pulling up her veil
active:  it is Kate Whitney
active:  you startled me, Kate
active:  I had not an idea
active:  you were
active:  you came in
noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  I came straight to you
active:  That was always the way
noverb:  Folk
active:  were
active:  in grief came to my wife
active:  birds to a light-house
active:  It was very sweet
noverb:  of you
active:  to come
noverb:  Now,
active:  you must have some wine
noverb:  water
active:  sit here comfortably
active:  tell us all about it
active:  Or should you rather
active:  I sent James off
active:  to bed
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  no
active:  I want the doctor's advice
noverb:  help
noverb:  too
active:  It's
active:  about Isa. He has not been home for two days
active:  I am so frightened
noverb:  about him
active:  It was not the first time
active:  she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble
noverb:  to me as a doctor
noverb:  to my wife as an old friend and school companion
active:  We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find
active:  Did she know
active:  her husband was
active:  Was it possible
noverb:  we could bring him back to her
active:  It seems
active:  it was
active:  She had the surest information
noverb:  of late he had
active:  the fit was on him
noverb:  made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City
passive: Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day
active:  he had come back
noverb:  twitching
noverb:  shattered
noverb:  in the evening
active:  now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours
active:  he lay there
noverb:  doubtless among the dregs of the docks
noverb:  breathing in the poison
noverb:  sleeping off the effects
noverb:  There
active:  he was to be found
active:  she was sure
noverb:  of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane
active:  was she
active:  to do
active:  could
active:  she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
active:  pluck her husband out from among the ruffians
active:  surrounded him
active:  There was the case
active:  of course there was
noverb:  one way out of it
active:  Might I not escort her to this place
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  as a second thought
active:  should she come at all
active:  I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser
noverb:  such I had influence over him
active:  I could manage it better
active:  I were alone
active:  I promised her on my word
noverb:  I would send him home in a cab within two hours
active:  he were indeed at the address
active:  she had given me
noverb:  And
noverb:  in ten minutes
active:  I had left my armchair
noverb:  cheery sitting-room behind me
active:  was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand
novoice: it seemed to me at the time
active:  the future only could show
noverb:  strange it was
active:  to be
active:  there was no great difficulty
noverb:  in the first stage of my adventure
noverb:  Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
active:  line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge
noverb:  Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop
passive: approached
active:  by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap
noverb:  the mouth of a cave
active:  I found the den of
active:  I was in search
noverb:  Ordering my cab
active:  to wait
active:  I passed down the steps
noverb:  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet
active:  and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
noverb:  made my way into a long, low room
noverb:  thick
noverb:  heavy with the brown opium smoke
novoice: terraced with wooden berths
noverb:  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
active:  Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies
active:  lying in strange fantastic poses
noverb:  bowed shoulders
noverb:  bent knees
noverb:  heads thrown back
active:  chins pointing upward
noverb:  with here
noverb:  there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer
noverb:  Out of the black shadows
active:  there glimmered little red circles of light
noverb:  now bright
noverb:  now faint
noverb:  as the burning poison waxed
novoice: waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
noverb:  The most lay silent
noverb:  some muttered to themselves
novoice: others talked together in a strange
noverb:  low
noverb:  monotonous voice
noverb:  their conversation coming in gushes
active:  suddenly tailing off into silence
noverb:  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
active:  At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal
noverb:  beside
active:  on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall
noverb:  thin old man
active:  with his jaw resting upon his two fists
noverb:  his elbows upon his knees
noverb:  staring into the fire
active:  I entered
active:  a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me
noverb:  a supply of the drug
active:  beckoning me to an empty berth
active:  Thank you
active:  I have not come
active:  to stay
active:  said I.
active:  There is a friend
noverb:  of mine here
noverb:  Mr. Isa Whitney
active:  I wish
active:  to speak with him
active:  There was a movement
noverb:  an exclamation from my right
active:  peering through the gloom
active:  I saw Whitney
noverb:  pale, haggard, and unkempt
active:  staring out at me
noverb:  My God
active:  It's Watson
active:  said he
active:  He was in a pitiable state of reaction
noverb:  with every nerve in a twitter
active:  I say
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  o'clock is it
noverb:  Nearly eleven
noverb:  Of
noverb:  day
noverb:  Of Friday
noverb:  June 19th
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I thought
active:  it was Wednesday
active:  It is Wednesday
noverb:  d'you want
active:  to frighten a chap for
active:  He sank his face onto his arms
active:  began
active:  to sob in a high treble key
active:  I tell you
active:  it is Friday
noverb:  man
active:  Your wife has been waiting this two days for you
active:  You should be ashamed
noverb:  of yourself
active:  I am
noverb:  you've got mixed
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  for I have only been here a few hours
noverb:  three pipes
noverb:  four pipes
active:  I forget
noverb:  many
active:  But I'll go home with you
noverb:  I wouldn't frighten Kate
noverb:  poor little Kate
noverb:  Give me your hand
noverb:  Have you a cab
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have one waiting
active:  I shall go in
noverb:  it
active:  But I must owe something
noverb:  Find
active:  I owe
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am all
noverb:  off colour
active:  I can do nothing for myself
active:  I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers
active:  holding my breath
active:  to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug
noverb:  looking about for the manager
active:  As I passed the tall man
active:  sat by the brazier
active:  I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt
noverb:  a low voice whispered
noverb:  Walk past me
noverb:  look back at me
noverb:  The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
active:  I glanced down
active:  They could only have come from the old man at my side
active:  he sat now
noverb:  very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age
noverb:  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees
noverb:  as
active:  it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
active:  I took two steps forward
active:  looked back
active:  It took all my self-control
active:  to prevent me
active:  breaking out into a cry of astonishment
active:  He had turned his back
active:  that none could see him
active:  I. His form had filled out
passive: his wrinkles were gone
active:  the dull eyes had regained their fire
noverb:  there
noverb:  sitting by the fire
noverb:  grinning at my surprise
noverb:  was none other than Sherlock Holmes
active:  He made a slight motion to me
active:  to approach him
noverb:  as he turned his face half round to the company once
novoice: subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I whispered
noverb:  on earth are you doing in this den
active:  you can
active:  he answered
active:  I have excellent ears
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to get rid of that sottish friend of yours
active:  I should be exceedingly glad
active:  to have a little talk with you
active:  I have a cab
active:  pray
noverb:  send him home in it
active:  You may safely trust him
noverb:  for he appears to be too limp
active:  to get into any mischief
active:  I should recommend you also
active:  to send a note by the cabman to your wife
active:  to say
active:  you have thrown in your lot with me
active:  you will wait
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in five minutes
active:  It was difficult
active:  to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests
noverb:  for they were always
noverb:  exceedingly definite
noverb:  put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
active:  I felt
noverb:  however
active:  Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission
passive: was practically accomplished
noverb:  and for the rest
active:  I could not wish anything better
noverb:  than
passive: to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures
active:  were the normal condition of his existence
active:  In a few minutes I had written my note
active:  paid Whitney's bill
active:  led him out to the cab
noverb:  seen him driven through the darkness
active:  In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
active:  I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes
active:  For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
active:  glancing quickly round
active:  he straightened himself out
noverb:  burst into a hearty fit of laughter
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  you imagine
active:  I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections
noverb:  all the other little weaknesses on
active:  you have favoured me with your medical views
passive: I was certainly surprised
noverb:  to find you there
noverb:  not
noverb:  I
active:  to find you
active:  I came to find a friend
noverb:  And I
active:  to find an enemy
noverb:  An enemy
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  one of my natural enemies
active:  shall I say
noverb:  my natural prey
noverb:  Briefly,
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry
active:  I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
active:  I have done
noverb:  now
passive: Had I been recognised in that den my life
noverb:  would not have been worth an hour's purchase
noverb:  for I have used it
noverb:  now for my own purposes
noverb:  the rascally Lascar
active:  runs
active:  it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
active:  There is a trap-door at the back of
noverb:  building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf,
active:  could tell some strange tales of
active:  has passed through
noverb:  it upon the moonless nights
active:  You do not mean bodies
noverb:  Ay,
noverb:  bodies
noverb:  Watson
active:  We should be rich men
active:  we had $1000 for every poor devil
passive: has been done to death in that den
active:  It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside
active:  I fear
active:  Neville St. Clair has entered it never
active:  to leave it
active:  our trap should be here
active:  He put his two forefingers between his teeth
novoice: whistled shrilly
noverb:  a signal
passive: was answered by a similar whistle from the distance
novoice: followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom
active:  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
active:  You'll come with me
noverb:  won't you
active:  I can be of use
noverb:  Oh
active:  a trusty comrade is always of use
noverb:  and a chronicler still
active:  My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one
noverb:  The Cedars
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is Mr. St. Clair's house
active:  I am staying there
active:  I conduct the inquiry
active:  Where is it
noverb:  Near Lee
noverb:  in Kent
active:  We have a seven-mile drive
noverb:  us
active:  I am all
noverb:  in the dark
active:  course
active:  you are
active:  You'll know all about it presently
noverb:  Jump up here
noverb:  All right
noverb:  John
active:  we shall not need you
noverb:  Here's half a crown
noverb:  Look out for me to-morrow
noverb:  about eleven
active:  Give her her head
noverb:  long
active:  He flicked the horse with his whip
active:  we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre
noverb:  deserted streets
active:  widened gradually
active:  we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge
noverb:  with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
noverb:  Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks
noverb:  mortar
noverb:  its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman
noverb:  the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers
active:  A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky
noverb:  a star
novoice: two twinkled dimly here
noverb:  there through the rifts of the clouds
active:  Holmes drove in silence
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  the air of a man
passive: is lost in thought
active:  I sat beside him
noverb:  curious
active:  to learn
active:  this new quest might be
active:  seemed to tax his powers
noverb:  sorely
noverb:  afraid
active:  to break in upon the current of his thoughts
active:  We had driven several miles
active:  were beginning
active:  to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas
active:  he shook himself
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  lit up his pipe with the air of a man
active:  has satisfied himself
active:  he is acting for the best
active:  You have a grand gift of silence
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
noverb:  Pon my word
active:  it is a great thing
noverb:  for me
active:  to have someone
active:  to talk to
active:  for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant
active:  I was wondering
active:  I should say to this dear little woman to-night
active:  she meets me at the door
active:  You forget
active:  I know nothing about it
noverb:  I shall just have time
noverb:  to tell you the facts of the case
active:  we get to Lee
active:  It seems absurdly simple
active:  somehow I can get nothing
active:  to go upon
active:  There's plenty of thread
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  I can't get the end of it into my hand
noverb:  Now,
active:  I'll state the case clearly
active:  concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark
noverb:  all is dark to me
active:  Proceed
noverb:  Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman
noverb:  Neville St. Clair by name
active:  appeared to have plenty of money
active:  He took a large villa

active:  to ascertain
noverb:  amount to $88 10s
active:  he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank

noverb:  therefore
active:  to think

active:  Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
noverb:  usual
active:  remarking
active:  he started
active:  he had two important commissions
active:  to perform
active:  he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  by the merest chance
active:  his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday
noverb:  very shortly after his departure
noverb:  to the effect
noverb:  a small parcel of considerable value
active:  she had been expecting
active:  was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company
noverb:  Now,
active:  you are well up in your London
active:  you will know

active:  did some shopping
novoice: proceeded to the company's office
active:  got her packet
active:  found herself at exactly 4
noverb:  35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station

active:  she distinctly saw his face
active:  she describes
passive: being terribly agitated
active:  He waved his hands frantically to her
passive: vanished from the window
noverb:  suddenly

active:  he wore some dark coat
noverb:  such as he had started to town in
active:  he had on
noverb:  collar nor necktie
active:  Convinced
active:  something was amiss with him
active:  she rushed down the steps
noverb:  for the house was none other than the opium den in
active:  you found me to-night
noverb:  running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs
active:  led to the first floor
noverb:  At the foot of the stairs
noverb:  however
active:  she met this Lascar scoundrel of

passive: aided by a Dane
noverb:  acts as assistant there
active:  pushed her out into the street
passive: Filled with the most maddening doubts
noverb:  fears
active:  she rushed down the lane
noverb:  by rare good-fortune
active:  met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector
noverb:  all on their way to their beat
noverb:  The inspector
active:  two men accompanied her back
noverb:  in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor
active:  they made their way to the room in
active:  Mr. St. Clair had last
passive: been seen
noverb:  There was no sign of him there
noverb:  In fact
noverb:  in the whole of
active:  floor
active:  there was no one
noverb:  to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect
active:  it seems
noverb:  made his home there
noverb:  he
active:  the Lascar stoutly swore
active:  no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon
noverb:  determined was their denial
passive: the inspector was staggered
active:  had almost come to believe
passive: Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded
active:  , with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
noverb:  lay upon the table
active:  tore the lid from it
active:  Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks
active:  It was the toy
noverb:  which he had promised to bring home

noverb:  The bedroom window was a broad one
novoice: opened from below

noverb:  all were there
active:  There were no signs
noverb:  of violence upon any of these garments
active:  there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  Out of the window he must apparently have gone
passive: for no other exit could be discovered
active:  the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise
active:  he could save himself by swimming
active:  for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
noverb:  And now as to the villains
active:  seemed
passive: to be immediately implicated in the matter
passive: The Lascar was known
active:  to be a man of the vilest antecedents
noverb:  as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known
novoice: to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window
active:  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
active:  His defence was one of absolute ignorance
active:  he protested
active:  he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone
noverb:  his lodger

noverb:  Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is
noverb:  as you may have remarked
noverb:  a small angle in the wall
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  this creature takes his daily seat
noverb:  cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap
active:  he is a piteous spectacle
active:  a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap
noverb:  lies upon the pavement beside him
active:  I have watched the fellow more than once
noverb:  I thought
active:  making his professional acquaintance
passive: I have been surprised at the harvest
active:  he has reaped in a short time
noverb:  His appearance
noverb:  you see
active:  is so remarkable
active:  no one can pass him
active:  observing him
noverb:  A shock of orange hair
passive: a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar
active:  , by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip
noverb:  a bulldog chin
noverb:  a pair of very penetrating dark eyes
active:  present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair
noverb:  all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants
noverb:  too
active:  does his wit
noverb:  for he is
noverb:  ready with a reply to any piece of chaff
passive: may be thrown at him by the passers-by
active:  This is the man
active:  we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den
active:  to have been the last man
active:  to see the gentleman of
active:  we are in quest
noverb:  a cripple
active:  said I.
active:  could
active:  he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life
active:  He is a cripple
noverb:  in the sense
active:  he walks with a limp
noverb:  in other respects
active:  he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man
active:  Surely your medical experience would tell you
noverb:  Watson
passive: weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
active:  Pray
active:  continue your narrative
active:  Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window
passive: she was escorted home in a cab by the police
active:  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
noverb:  Inspector Barton
active:  had charge of the case
active:  made a very careful examination of the premises
noverb:  without finding anything
active:  threw any light upon the matter
passive: One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone
passive: he was allowed some few minutes during
active:  he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar
passive: this fault was soon remedied
passive: he was seized and searched
passive: without anything being found
active:  could incriminate him
active:  There were
active:  it is true
noverb:  , some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve
noverb:  ,
active:  he pointed to his ring-finger
passive: had been cut near the nail
active:  explained
active:  the bleeding came from there

active:  had been observed there
active:  came doubtless from the same source
noverb:  He
active:  denied strenuously
novoice: having
noverb:  seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  swore
active:  the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police
noverb:  As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion
active:  she had actually seen her husband at the window
active:  he declared
active:  she must have been
noverb:  mad
noverb:  dreaming
passive: He was removed
passive: loudly protesting
noverb:  to the police-station
active:  the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope
active:  the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
active:  And it did
passive: they hardly found upon the mud-bank
active:  they had feared
active:  to find
active:  It was Neville St. Clair's coat
noverb:  not Neville St. Clair
active:  lay uncovered
active:  the tide receded
noverb:  And
active:  do you think
passive: they found in the pockets
active:  I cannot imagine
noverb:  No
noverb:  I don't think
active:  you would guess
active:  Every pocket stuffed with pennies
noverb:  half-pennies
noverb:  421 pennies and 270 half-pennies
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that it had not been swept away by the tide
active:  a human body is a different matter
active:  There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
active:  It seemed likely enough
active:  the weighted coat had remained
passive: the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
active:  I understand
passive: all the other clothes were found in the room
active:  Would the body
passive: be dressed in a coat alone
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
passive: the facts might be met speciously enough
active:  Suppose
active:  this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window
active:  there is no human eye
active:  could have seen the deed
active:  would
active:  he do
active:  It would of course
active:  strike him
active:  he must get rid of the tell-tale garments
active:  He would seize the coat
active:  be in the act
active:  throwing it out
active:  it would occur to him
active:  it would swim
noverb:  not sink
active:  He has little time
noverb:  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
novoice: the wife tried
active:  to force her way up
active:  perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate
active:  the police are hurrying up the street
active:  There is not an instant
passive: to be lost
active:  He rushes to some secret hoard
active:  he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary
active:  he stuffs all the coins upon
active:  he can lay his hands into the pockets
active:  to make sure of the coat's sinking
active:  He throws it out
active:  would have done the same with the other garments
active:  had not he heard the rush of steps below
noverb:  only just had time
active:  to close the window
active:  the police appeared
active:  It certainly sounds feasible
noverb:  Well,
active:  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better
noverb:  Boone
active:  I have told you
passive: was arrested and taken to the station
passive: it could not be shown
active:  there had
active:  been anything against him
active:  He had
passive: for years been known as a professional beggar
novoice: his life appeared
active:  to have been a very quiet
noverb:  innocent one
noverb:  There the matter stands at present
noverb:  the questions
active:  have to be solved
active:  --what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as
active:  I confess
active:  I cannot recall any case within my experience
active:  looked at the first glance
noverb:  simple
noverb:  yet
active:  presented such difficulties
active:  Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
active:  we had been whirling
passive: through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind
active:  we rattled along with a country hedge upon
noverb:  side of us
noverb:  Just as he finished
noverb:  however
active:  we drove through two scattered villages
active:  a few lights still glimmered in the windows
active:  We are on the outskirts of Lee
active:  said my companion
active:  We have touched on three English counties in our short drive
noverb:  starting in Middlesex
noverb:  passing over an angle of Surrey
noverb:  ending in Kent
noverb:  See
active:  light among the trees
active:  That is The Cedars
active:  beside that lamp sits a woman
passive: anxious ears have already
active:  I have little doubt
active:  caught the clink of our horse's feet
active:  are you not conducting the case from Baker Street
active:  I asked
active:  there are many inquiries
passive: must be made out here
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal
active:  you may rest assured
active:  she will have nothing
noverb:  a welcome for my friend and colleague
active:  I hate to meet her
noverb:  Watson
active:  I have no news of her husband
noverb:  Here we are
noverb:  Whoa
noverb:  there
noverb:  whoa
active:  We had pulled up in front of a large villa
novoice: stood within its own grounds
active:  A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head
active:  springing down
active:  I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
active:  led to the house
active:  we approached
active:  the door flew open
novoice: a little blonde woman stood in the opening
noverb:  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie
noverb:  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
active:  She stood
novoice: with her figure outlined against the flood of light
noverb:  one hand upon the door
noverb:  one half-raised in her eagerness
noverb:  her body slightly bent
noverb:  , her head
novoice: face protruded
noverb:  with eager eyes
noverb:  parted lips
noverb:  a standing question
noverb:  Well
active:  she cried
noverb:  well
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  there were two of us
noverb:  , she gave a cry of hope
active:  sank into a groan as she
active:  saw
active:  my companion shook his head
active:  shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  No good news
noverb:  None
noverb:  No bad
noverb:  No
noverb:  Thank God for that
active:  come in
active:  You must be weary
noverb:  , for you have had a long day
active:  This is my friend, Dr. Watson
active:  He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases
active:  a lucky chance has made it possible for me
active:  to bring him out
active:  associate him with this investigation
passive: I am delighted
active:  to see you
active:  said she
active:  pressing my hand warmly
active:  You will
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , forgive anything
active:  may be wanting in our arrangements
active:  you consider the blow
active:  has come
noverb:  suddenly upon us
noverb:  My dear madam
active:  said I
active:  I am an old campaigner
active:  I were not
active:  I can very well see
passive: no apology is needed
active:  If I can be of any assistance
noverb:  to you
noverb:  to my friend here
active:  I shall be indeed happy
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said the lady
active:  we entered a well-lit dining-room
noverb:  upon the table of
passive: a cold supper had been laid out
active:  I should very much
noverb:  like to ask you one or two plain questions
noverb:  to
active:  I beg
active:  you will give a plain answer
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  madam
active:  Do not trouble about my feelings
active:  I am not hysterical
noverb:  ,
noverb:  given
active:  to fainting
active:  I simply wish to hear your real
noverb:  real opinion
noverb:  Upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  In your heart of hearts
active:  do you think
active:  Neville is alive
active:  Sherlock Holmes seemed
passive: to be embarrassed by the question
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  now
active:  she repeated
noverb:  standing upon the rug
noverb:  looking keenly down at him
active:  he leaned back in a basket-chair
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  madam
active:  I do not
active:  You think
active:  he is dead
active:  I do
noverb:  Murdered
noverb:  I don't say that
noverb:  Perhaps
noverb:  And on
noverb:  day did he meet his death
noverb:  On Monday
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to explain
active:  it is
active:  I have received a letter from him to-day
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as
passive: he had been galvanised
active:  he roared
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  to-day
active:  She stood smiling
active:  holding up a little slip of paper in the air
active:  May I see it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  He snatched it from her in his eagerness
active:  smoothing it out upon the table
active:  he drew over the lamp
active:  examined it intently
active:  I had left my chair
active:  was gazing at it over his shoulder
noverb:  The envelope was a very coarse one
passive: was stamped with the Gravesend postmark
noverb:  with the date of that very day
noverb:  rather of the day before
active:  for it was considerably after midnight
noverb:  Coarse writing
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Surely this is not your husband's writing
noverb:  madam
noverb:  No
active:  the enclosure is
active:  I perceive also
active:  whoever addressed the envelope
passive: had
active:  to go and inquire as to the address
active:  can you tell that
noverb:  The name
noverb:  you see
active:  is in perfectly black ink
active:  has dried itself
active:  The rest is of the greyish colour
active:  shows
noverb:  blotting-paper has been used
passive: it had been written straight off
novoice: blotted
active:  none would be of a deep black shade
active:  This man has written the name
active:  there has
active:  been a pause
active:  he wrote the address
active:  can only mean
active:  he was not familiar
noverb:  with it
active:  It is, of course, a trifle
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so important as trifles
noverb:  Let us now see the letter
noverb:  Ha! there has been an enclosure here
noverb:  Yes
active:  there was a ring
noverb:  His signet-ring
active:  And you are sure
active:  this is your husband's hand
noverb:  One of his hands
noverb:  One
noverb:  His hand
active:  he wrote hurriedly
active:  It is very unlike his usual writing
noverb:  I know it well
active:  Dearest do not
passive: be frightened
noverb:  All will come well
active:  There is a huge error
noverb:  which it may take some little time
active:  to rectify
noverb:  Wait in patience
noverb:  NEVILLE
passive: Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark
noverb:  Hum
active:  Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb
noverb:  Ha
passive: And the flap has been gummed
active:  I am not very much
noverb:  in error
noverb:  by a person
active:  had been chewing tobacco
active:  And you have no doubt
active:  it is your husband's hand, madam
noverb:  None
active:  Neville wrote those words
active:  And they were posted to-day at Gravesend
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair
active:  the clouds lighten
active:  I should not venture to say
active:  the danger is over
active:  he must be alive
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  this is a clever forgery
active:  to put us on the wrong scent
active:  The ring, after all, proves nothing
passive: It may have been taken from him
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  it is
active:  it is his very own writing
noverb:  Very well
active:  It may
noverb:  however
passive: have been written on Monday
active:  only posted to-day
active:  That is possible
active:  much may have happened between
noverb:  Oh
active:  you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes
active:  I know
noverb:  all is well with him
active:  There is so keen
noverb:  a sympathy between us
active:  I should know
active:  evil came upon him
noverb:  On the very day
noverb:  I saw him last
active:  he cut himself in the bedroom
noverb:  I in the dining-room rushed upstairs
noverb:  with the utmost certainty
active:  something had happened
active:  Do you think
active:  I would respond to such a trifle
active:  be ignorant of his death
active:  I have seen too much not to know
active:  the impression of a woman may be more valuable
noverb:  the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
active:  And in this letter
active:  you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence
active:  to corroborate your view
active:  your husband is alive and able
active:  to write letters
active:  should he remain away from
noverb:  you
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  It is unthinkable
active:  And on Monday he made no remarks
active:  leaving you
noverb:  No
passive: And you were surprised
active:  to see him in Swandam Lane
noverb:  Very much
active:  Was the window open
noverb:  Yes
active:  he might have called to
noverb:  you
active:  He might
noverb:  He only
active:  I understand
active:  gave an inarticulate cry
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  A call for help
active:  you thought
noverb:  Yes
active:  He waved his hands
active:  it might have been a cry of surprise
active:  Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him
active:  to throw up his hands
active:  It is possible
active:  And you thought
passive: he was pulled back
active:  He disappeared
noverb:  suddenly
active:  He might have leaped back
active:  You did not see anyone else in the room
noverb:  No
active:  this horrible man confessed
active:  to having been there
active:  the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  Your husband
active:  you could see
active:  had his ordinary clothes on
noverb:  without his collar or tie
active:  I distinctly saw his bare throat
active:  Had he
noverb:  spoken of Swandam Lane
noverb:  Never
active:  Had he ever showed any signs
active:  having taken opium
noverb:  Never
active:  Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair
noverb:  Those are the principal points about
active:  I wished to be absolutely clear
active:  We shall
active:  now have a little supper
noverb:  retire
noverb:  for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
noverb:  A large
passive: comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
active:  I was quickly between the sheets
noverb:  for
active:  I was weary
noverb:  after my night of adventure
active:  Sherlock Holmes was a man
noverb:  however
active:  he had an unsolved problem upon his mind
active:  would go for days
active:  even for a week, without rest, turning it over
active:  rearranging his facts
active:  looking at it from every point of view
active:  he had
active:  fathomed it
active:  convinced himself
active:  his data were insufficient
active:  It was soon evident
noverb:  to me
active:  he was
active:  now preparing for an all-night sitting
active:  He took off his coat
noverb:  waistcoat
noverb:  put on a large blue dressing-gown
novoice: wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed
noverb:  cushions from the sofa and armchairs
noverb:  With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan
noverb:  upon
active:  he perched himself cross-legged
novoice: with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
noverb:  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there
noverb:  an old briar pipe between his lips
noverb:  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling
active:  the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless
noverb:  with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features
active:  he sat as
active:  I dropped off
active:  to sleep
active:  he sat
active:  a sudden ejaculation caused me
active:  to wake up
active:  I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
active:  The pipe was still between his lips
noverb:  the smoke still curled upward
active:  the room was full of a dense tobacco haze
novoice: nothing remained of the heap of shag
active:  I had seen upon the previous night
noverb:  Awake
noverb:  Watson
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Game for a morning drive
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  dress
active:  No one is stirring yet
active:  I know
noverb:  the stable-boy sleeps
active:  we shall soon have the trap out
active:  He chuckled to himself as he
active:  spoke
novoice: his eyes twinkled
active:  he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
active:  I dressed
active:  I glanced at my watch
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that no one was stirring
active:  It was twenty-five minutes past four
active:  I had hardly finished
active:  Holmes returned with the news
active:  the boy was putting in the horse
active:  I want to test a little theory of mine
active:  said he
noverb:  pulling on his boots
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe
active:  I deserve
passive: to be kicked from here to Charing Cross
active:  But I think
active:  I have the key of the affair now
active:  And where is it
active:  I asked
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  In the bathroom
active:  he answered
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I am not joking
active:  he continued
active:  seeing my look of incredulity
active:  I have just been there
active:  I have taken it out
active:  I have got it in this Gladstone bag
active:  Come on
noverb:  my boy
active:  we shall see
active:  it will not fit the lock
active:  We made our way downstairs
noverb:  possible
noverb:  out into the bright morning sunshine
active:  In the road stood our horse
noverb:  trap
noverb:  with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head
noverb:  We
active:  sprang in
noverb:  away we dashed down the London Road
active:  A few country carts were stirring
noverb:  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis
noverb:  the lines of villas on
active:  side were as silent
noverb:  lifeless as some city in a dream
active:  It has been in some points a singular case
active:  said Holmes
active:  flicking the horse on into a gallop
active:  I confess
active:  I have been
noverb:  a mole
active:  it is better
active:  to learn wisdom late
noverb:  never
active:  to learn it at all
active:  In town the earliest risers were just beginning
active:  to look sleepily from their windows
active:  we drove through the streets of the Surrey side
noverb:  Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road
active:  we crossed over the river
active:  dashing up Wellington Street
novoice: wheeled sharply to the right
active:  found ourselves in Bow Street
passive: Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force
active:  the two constables at the door saluted him
active:  One of them held the horse's head
active:  the other led us in
active:  is on duty
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Inspector Bradstreet
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Bradstreet
active:  are you
noverb:  A tall
active:  stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage
noverb:  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket
active:  I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Step into my room here
active:  It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table
active:  a telephone projecting from the wall
active:  The inspector sat down at his desk
active:  can
active:  I do for you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I called about that beggarman
noverb:  Boone
noverb:  the one
passive: was charged
passive: being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  of Lee
noverb:  Yes
passive: He was brought up
novoice: remanded for further inquiries
active:  I heard
noverb:  You have him here
noverb:  In the cells
noverb:  Is he quiet
noverb:  Oh
active:  he gives no trouble
active:  he is a dirty scoundrel
noverb:  Dirty
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is all
noverb:  we can do to make him wash his hands
active:  his face is
noverb:  a tinker's
noverb:  Well,
passive: once his case has been settled
active:  he will have a regular prison
active:  bath
active:  and I think
active:  you saw him
active:  you would agree with me
active:  he needed it
active:  I should like to see him very much
active:  Would you
passive: That is easily done
active:  Come this way
active:  You can leave your bag
noverb:  No
active:  I think
active:  I'll take it
noverb:  Very good
active:  Come this way
noverb:  you
active:  He led us down a passage
active:  opened a barred door
novoice: passed down a winding stair
active:  brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
active:  The third on the right is his
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
novoice: glanced through
active:  He is asleep
active:  said he
active:  You can see him very well
noverb:  We
novoice: put our eyes to the grating
noverb:  The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly
noverb:  heavily
active:  He was a middle-sized man
active:  coarsely clad
active:  became his calling
active:  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
active:  He was
active:  the inspector had said
noverb:  extremely dirty
noverb:  the grime
active:  covered his face
active:  could not conceal its repulsive ugliness
active:  A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin
active:  by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip
passive: three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
active:  A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
active:  He's a beauty
noverb:  isn't he
noverb:  said the inspector
active:  He certainly needs a wash
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I had an idea
active:  he might
active:  I took the liberty
active:  bringing the tools with me
active:  He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke
active:  took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge
noverb:  He! he
active:  You are a funny one
active:  chuckled the inspector
noverb:  Now,
active:  you will have the great goodness
active:  to open
noverb:  door very quietly
noverb:  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  not
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells
active:  does he
active:  He slipped his key into the lock
noverb:  we all very quietly entered the cell
active:  The sleeper half turned
novoice: settled down once
noverb:  into a deep slumber
active:  Holmes stooped to the water-jug
active:  moistened his sponge
active:  rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face
noverb:  Let me introduce you
active:  he shouted
noverb:  to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent
noverb:  Never in my life have I seen such a sight
novoice: The man's face peeled off under the sponge
noverb:  the bark from a tree
noverb:  Gone was the coarse brown tint
noverb:  Gone
noverb:  too
active:  was the horrid scar
active:  had seamed it across
noverb:  the twisted lip
active:  had given the repulsive sneer to the face
active:  A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
noverb:  there
novoice: sitting up in his bed
active:  was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man
noverb:  black-haired
noverb:  smooth-skinned
active:  rubbing his eyes
active:  staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
active:  suddenly realising the exposure
active:  he broke into a scream
active:  threw himself down with his face to the pillow
noverb:  Great heavens
active:  cried the inspector
active:  it is
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  the missing man
active:  I know him from the photograph
active:  The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man
active:  abandons himself to his destiny
active:  Be it
active:  said he
active:  And pray
active:  am I charged with
active:  making away with Mr. Neville St.
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
noverb:  you can't be charged with
active:  they make a case of attempted suicide of it
active:  said the inspector with a grin
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have been twenty-seven years in the force
noverb:  this really takes the cake
active:  I am Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  ,
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that no crime has been committed
noverb:  therefore
passive: I am illegally detained
noverb:  No crime
passive: a very great error has been committed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  You would have done better to have trusted you wife
active:  It was not the wife
active:  it was the children
active:  groaned the prisoner
active:  God help me
active:  I would not have them ashamed of their father
noverb:  My God
noverb:  an exposure
active:  can
active:  I do
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch
active:  patted him kindly on the shoulder
active:  you leave it to a court of law
active:  to clear the matter up
active:  said he
active:  course
active:  you can hardly avoid publicity
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  you convince the police authorities
active:  there is no possible case against you
active:  I do not know
active:  there is any reason
noverb:  that the details should find their way into the papers
active:  Inspector Bradstreet would
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , make notes upon anything
active:  you might tell us
active:  submit it to the proper authorities
active:  The case would
active:  never go into court at all
active:  God bless you
active:  cried the prisoner passionately
active:  I would have endured imprisonment
noverb:  ay
noverb:  even execution
noverb:  rather
active:  have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
active:  You are the first
active:  have ever heard my story
active:  My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield
active:  I received an excellent education
active:  I travelled in my youth
active:  took to the stage
active:  finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London
noverb:  One day my editor wished
active:  to have a series of articles
active:  begging in the metropolis
active:  I volunteered to supply them
active:  There was the point
noverb:  from
active:  all my adventures started
active:  It was only
active:  trying begging as an amateur
active:  I could get the facts upon
active:  to base my articles
noverb:  When an actor
active:  I had
noverb:  of course
active:  learned all the secrets
active:  making up
active:  had been famous in the green-room for my skill
active:  I took advantage now of my attainments
active:  I painted my face
active:  to make myself
noverb:  possible I made a good scar
active:  fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster
active:  with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city
noverb:  ostensibly as a match-seller
noverb:  really as a beggar
active:  For seven hours I plied my trade
active:  I returned home in the evening
passive: I found to my surprise
active:  I had received no less than 26s
noverb:  4d
active:  I wrote my articles
active:  thought little
noverb:  of the matter until
noverb:  some time later
active:  I backed a bill for a friend
active:  had a writ served upon me for $25
active:  I was at my wit's end
active:  to get the money
active:  a sudden idea came to me
active:  I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor
novoice: asked for a holiday from my employers
novoice: spent the time
active:  begging in the City under my disguise
active:  In ten days I had the money
active:  had paid the debt
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can imagine
noverb:  hard it was
active:  to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week
active:  I knew
active:  I could earn as much in a day
active:  smearing my face with a little paint
active:  laying my cap on the ground
noverb:  sitting still
active:  It was a long fight between my pride and the money
novoice: the dollars won at last
active:  I threw up reporting
noverb:  sat day after day in the corner
active:  I had first chosen
noverb:  inspiring pity by my ghastly face
active:  filling my pockets with coppers
active:  Only one man knew my secret
active:  He was the keeper
noverb:  of a low den in
active:  I used
active:  to lodge in Swandam Lane
active:  I could
active:  every morning emerge as a squalid beggar
active:  in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town
noverb:  This fellow, a Lascar
passive: was well paid by me for his rooms
active:  I knew
active:  my secret was safe in his possession
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  very soon I found
active:  I was saving considerable sums of money
active:  I do not mean
active:  any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--
active:  I had exceptional advantages in my power
active:  making up
noverb:  also in a facility of repartee
active:  improved by practice
active:  made me quite a recognised character in the City
noverb:  All day a stream of pennies
passive: varied by silver
novoice: poured in upon me
active:  it was a very bad day in
active:  I failed to take $2
active:  I grew richer
active:  I grew more ambitious
active:  took a house in the country
noverb:  eventually married
active:  without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
active:  My dear wife knew
active:  I had business in the City
active:  She little knew
active:  Last Monday I had finished for the day
active:  was dressing in my room above the opium den
active:  I looked out of my window
noverb:  saw
noverb:  to my horror and astonishment
active:  my wife was standing in the street
noverb:  with her eyes fixed full upon me
active:  I gave a cry of surprise
active:  threw up my arms
active:  to cover my face
active:  rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him
active:  to prevent anyone
active:  coming up to me
active:  I heard her voice downstairs
active:  I knew
active:  she could not ascend
active:  Swiftly I threw off my clothes
passive: pulled on those of a beggar
noverb:  put on my pigments and wig
active:  Even a wife's eyes could not pierce
active:  complete a disguise
active:  it occurred to me
active:  there might be a search
noverb:  in the room
active:  the clothes might betray me
noverb:  I threw open the window
active:  reopening by my violence a small cut
active:  I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning
active:  Then I seized my coat
passive: was weighted by the coppers
active:  I had just transferred to
noverb:  it from the leather bag in
active:  I carried my takings
active:  I hurled it out of the window
active:  it disappeared into the Thames
active:  The other clothes would have followed
noverb:  at that moment
active:  there was a rush of constables up the stair
noverb:  a few minutes after I found
noverb:  rather
active:  I confess
noverb:  to my relief
noverb:  instead
passive: being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair
passive: I was arrested as his murderer
active:  I do not know
active:  there is anything
noverb:  else for me
active:  to explain
passive: I was determined
active:  to preserve my disguise
noverb:  possible
noverb:  hence my preference for a dirty face
active:  Knowing
active:  my wife would be terribly anxious
active:  I slipped off my ring
active:  confided it to the Lascar at a moment
active:  no constable was watching me
noverb:  together with a hurried scrawl
active:  telling her
active:  she had no cause
active:  to fear
noverb:  That note only reached her yesterday
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Good God
noverb:  a week
active:  she must have spent
active:  The police have watched this Lascar
active:  said Inspector Bradstreet
active:  and I can quite understand
active:  he might find it difficult
active:  to post a letter unobserved
active:  Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his
active:  forgot all about it for some days
active:  That was it
active:  said Holmes
active:  nodding approvingly
active:  I have no doubt of it
passive: have
passive: you never been prosecuted for begging
noverb:  Many times
active:  was a fine to me
active:  It must stop here
noverb:  however
active:  said Bradstreet
active:  the police are to hush this thing up
active:  there must be no
noverb:  more of Hugh Boone
active:  I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths
active:  a man can take
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that no further steps may be taken
passive: you are found again
noverb:  all must come out
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  we are very much indebted to you
active:  having cleared the matter up
active:  I wish
active:  I knew
active:  you reach your results
active:  I reached this one
active:  said my friend
active:  sitting upon five pillows
active:  consuming an ounce of shag
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we drive to Baker Street
active:  we shall just be in time for breakfast
noverb:  VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
active:  I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas
noverb:  with the intention
noverb:  wishing him the compliments of the season
active:  He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown
noverb:  a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right
noverb:  a pile of crumpled morning papers
noverb:  evidently newly studied
noverb:  near at hand
active:  Beside the couch was a wooden chair
active:  on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
noverb:  disreputable hard-felt hat
noverb:  much the worse for wear
novoice: cracked in several places
noverb:  A lens
noverb:  a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested
passive: the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
passive: You are engaged
active:  said I
active:  perhaps I interrupt you
noverb:  Not at all
active:  I am glad
active:  to have a friend with
active:  I can discuss my results
active:  The matter is a perfectly trivial one
noverb:  --he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--
novoice: there are points in connection with it
active:  are not entirely devoid of interest
noverb:  even of instruction
active:  I seated myself in his armchair
active:  warmed my hands
noverb:  his crackling fire
active:  for a sharp frost had set in
active:  the windows were thick with the ice crystals
active:  I suppose
active:  I remarked
noverb:  homely as it looks
noverb:  this thing has some deadly story linked on to it
active:  it is the clue
noverb:  which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  No crime
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Only one of those whimsical little incidents
active:  will happen
noverb:  you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
noverb:  Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity
passive: every possible combination of events may be expected
active:  to take place
noverb:  many a little problem will be presented
active:  may be striking
noverb:  bizarre
active:  being criminal
active:  We have already had experience of such
noverb:  much
active:  I remarked
noverb:  of the last six cases
active:  I have added to my notes
active:  three have been entirely free of any legal crime
noverb:  Precisely
active:  You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland,
noverb:  to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
active:  You know Peterson, the commissionaire
noverb:  Yes
active:  It is to him
active:  this trophy belongs
active:  It is his hat
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  he found it
active:  Its owner is unknown
active:  I beg
active:  you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
noverb:  as an intellectual problem
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  as to
active:  it came here
active:  It arrived upon Christmas morning
noverb:  in company with a good fat goose
active:  is
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire
active:  The facts are these
noverb:  about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson
active:  you know
active:  is a very honest fellow
active:  was returning from some small jollification
active:  was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road
active:  In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man
noverb:  walking with a slight stagger
active:  carrying a white goose
novoice: slung over his shoulder
active:  he reached the corner of Goodge Street
active:  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs
active:  One of the latter knocked off the man's hat
noverb:  on
active:  he raised his stick
active:  to defend himself
active:  swinging it over his head
active:  smashed the shop window behind him
active:  Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants
noverb:  the man
noverb:  shocked
active:  having broken the window
active:  seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
active:  dropped his goose
active:  took to his heels
novoice: vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets
noverb:  lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road
active:  The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson
passive: he was left in possession of the field of battle
noverb:  also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
active:  surely he restored to their owner
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  there lies the problem
active:  It is true
noverb:  that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card
passive: was tied to the bird's left leg
active:  it is also true
noverb:  that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat
active:  there are some thousands of Bakers
noverb:  ,
noverb:  some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours
active:  it is not easy
active:  to restore lost property to any one of them
active:  did Peterson
active:  do
active:  He brought round
noverb:  hat
noverb:  goose to me on Christmas morning
noverb:  knowing
active:  even the smallest problems are of interest to me
noverb:  The goose
active:  we retained until this morning
active:  there were signs
noverb:  in spite of the slight frost
active:  it would be well
passive: it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
active:  Its finder has carried it off
noverb:  therefore
active:  to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
active:  I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman
active:  lost his Christmas dinner
active:  Did he not advertise
noverb:  No
noverb:  clue could you have as to his identity
noverb:  Only
active:  we can deduce
noverb:  From his hat
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you are joking
active:  can you gather from this old battered felt
active:  Here is my lens
active:  You know my methods
active:  can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man
active:  has worn this article
active:  I took the tattered object in my hands
active:  turned it over rather ruefully
active:  It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape
noverb:  hard
noverb:  much the worse for wear
active:  The lining had been of red silk
passive: was a good deal discoloured
active:  There was no maker's name
active:  Holmes had remarked
noverb:  the initials
noverb:  H. B.
passive: were scrawled upon one side
passive: It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer
active:  the elastic was missing
noverb:  For the rest
passive: it was cracked
noverb:  exceedingly dusty
novoice: spotted in several places
novoice: there seemed
active:  to have been some attempt
active:  to hide the discoloured patches
active:  smearing them with ink
active:  I can see nothing
active:  said I
active:  handing it back to my friend
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  Watson
active:  you can see everything
active:  You fail
noverb:  however
active:  to reason from
active:  you see
active:  You are too timid
noverb:  in drawing your inferences
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  it is
active:  you can infer from this hat
active:  He picked it up
active:  gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
active:  was characteristic of him
active:  It is perhaps less suggestive
noverb:  than it might
passive: have been
active:  he remarked
noverb:  and
active:  there are a few inferences
noverb:  which are very distinct
noverb:  a few others
active:  represent at least a strong balance of probability
active:  the man was highly intellectual
active:  is of course obvious upon the face of it
noverb:  also
active:  he was fairly well-to
noverb:  -do within the last three years
active:  he has now fallen upon evil days
active:  He had foresight
novoice: has less now
noverb:  formerly
active:  pointing to a moral retrogression
passive: taken with the decline of his fortunes
active:  seems to indicate some evil influence
noverb:  probably drink
noverb:  at work upon him
active:  This may account also for the obvious fact
active:  his wife has ceased to love him
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  He has
noverb:  however
active:  retained some degree of self-respect
active:  he continued
active:  disregarding my remonstrance
active:  He is a man
noverb:  who leads a sedentary life
active:  goes out little
active:  is out of training entirely
active:  is middle-aged
active:  has grizzled hair
active:  he has
active:  had cut within the last few days
active:  he anoints with lime-cream
noverb:  These are the more patent facts
active:  are to be deduced from his hat
noverb:  Also,
noverb:  by the way
active:  it is extremely improbable
noverb:  that he has gas laid on in his house
active:  You are certainly joking
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Is it possible
noverb:  even now
noverb:  I give you these results
active:  you are unable
active:  to see
passive: they are attained
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am very stupid
active:  I must confess
active:  I am unable
active:  to follow you
noverb:  For example
active:  did you deduce
active:  this man was intellectual
active:  For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head
active:  It came right over the forehead
novoice: settled upon the bridge of his nose
active:  It is a question of cubic capacity
active:  said he
noverb:  a man with
noverb:  large a brain must have something in it
noverb:  The decline of his fortunes
active:  This hat is three years old
passive: These flat brims curled
active:  at the edge came in
active:  It is a hat of the very best quality
noverb:  Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining
active:  this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago
active:  has had no hat
active:  he has assuredly gone down in the world
noverb:  Well,
active:  is clear enough
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  about the foresight and the moral retrogression
active:  Sherlock Holmes laughed
active:  Here is the foresight
active:  said
active:  he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
passive: They are never sold upon hats
active:  this man ordered one
active:  it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight
active:  he went out of his way
active:  to take this precaution against the wind
active:  we see
active:  he has broken the elastic
active:  has not troubled to replace it
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that he has less foresight now
noverb:  formerly
active:  is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt
active:  daubing them with ink
active:  is a sign
active:  he has not entirely lost his self-respect
active:  Your reasoning is certainly plausible
noverb:  The further points
active:  he is middle-aged
noverb:  ,
passive: his hair is grizzled
passive: it has been recently cut
noverb:  he uses lime-cream
noverb:  , are all
passive: to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining
active:  The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends
noverb:  clean cut by the scissors of the barber
noverb:  They all appear to be adhesive
active:  there is a distinct odour of lime-cream
noverb:  This dust
active:  you will observe
active:  is not the gritty, grey dust of the street
noverb:  the fluffy brown dust of the house
active:  showing
passive: it has been hung up indoors
noverb:  of the time
noverb:  the marks of moisture upon the
active:  are proof positive
active:  the wearer perspired very freely
active:  could therefore
active:  hardly be in the best of training
noverb:  his wife
active:  you said
active:  she had ceased to love him
passive: This hat has not been brushed for weeks
active:  When I see you
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat
active:  your wife allows you
active:  to go out in such a state
active:  I shall fear
active:  you also have been unfortunate enough
active:  to lose your wife's affection
active:  he might be a bachelor
noverb:  Nay,
active:  he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife
active:  Remember the card upon the bird's leg
active:  You have an answer to everything
noverb:  on earth do you deduce
passive: the gas is not laid on in his house
active:  One tallow stain
noverb:  even two
active:  might come by chance
active:  I see no less than five
active:  I think
active:  there can be little doubt
passive: the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow
noverb:  walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet
active:  Are you satisfied
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is very ingenious
active:  said I
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  as you said just now
active:  there has been no crime committed
active:  no harm done save the loss of a goose
noverb:  all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
active:  Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth
active:  to reply
active:  the door flew open
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  the commissionaire
active:  rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man
passive: is dazed with astonishment
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  sir
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Eh
noverb:  of it
active:  Has it returned to life
novoice: flapped off through the kitchen window
noverb:  Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa
active:  to get a fairer view of the man's excited face
noverb:  See here
noverb:  sir
noverb:  See
passive: my wife found in its crop
active:  He held out his hand
active:  displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone
noverb:  rather smaller
noverb:  a bean in size
noverb:  of such purity and radiance
active:  it twinkled
noverb:  an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle
noverb:  By Jove
noverb:  Peterson
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  this is treasure trove indeed
active:  I suppose
active:  you know
active:  you have got
noverb:  A diamond
noverb:  sir
noverb:  A precious stone
active:  It cuts into glass as
active:  it were putty
active:  It's more than a precious stone
active:  It is the precious stone
noverb:  Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  Precisely
active:  I ought to know its size
noverb:  shape
noverb:  seeing
active:  I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately
active:  It is absolutely unique
noverb:  ,
passive: its value can only be conjectured
passive: the reward offered
active:  of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
noverb:  A thousand pounds
noverb:  Great Lord of mercy
novoice: The commissionaire plumped down into a chair
novoice: stared from one to the other of us
active:  That is the reward
active:  I have reason
active:  to know
active:  there are sentimental considerations in the background
active:  would induce the Countess
active:  to part with half her fortune
active:  she could
active:  recover the gem
passive: It was lost
active:  I remember aright
noverb:  at the Hotel Cosmopolitan
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  on December 22nd
noverb:  just five days ago
passive: John Horner, a plumber, was accused
active:  having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case
noverb:  The evidence
active:  against him was so strong
noverb:  that the case has been referred to the Assizes
active:  I have some account of the matter here
active:  I believe
active:  He rummaged amid his newspapers
active:  glancing over the dates
noverb:  until at last he smoothed one out
active:  doubled it over
active:  read
noverb:  the following paragraph
noverb:  Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery
noverb:  John Horner
noverb:  26
noverb:  plumber
active:  was brought up upon the charge
novoice: having upon the 22nd inst
noverb:  abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle
noverb:  James Ryder
noverb:  upper-attendant at the hotel
active:  gave his evidence to the effect
active:  he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order
active:  he might solder the second bar of the grate
active:  was loose
active:  He had remained with Horner some little time
passive: had finally been called away
noverb:  On returning
active:  he found
active:  Horner had disappeared
active:  the bureau had been forced open
noverb:  the small morocco casket in
novoice: as it afterwards transpired
passive: the Countess was accustomed
active:  to keep her jewel
active:  was lying empty upon the dressing-table
noverb:  Ryder
active:  gave the alarm
passive: Horner was arrested the same evening
passive: the stone could not be found
noverb:  upon his person
noverb:  in his rooms
noverb:  Catherine Cusack
noverb:  maid to the Countess
active:  deposed
active:  to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay
active:  discovering the robbery
active:  to having rushed into the room
active:  she found matters
novoice: described by the last witness
active:  Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner
active:  struggled frantically
active:  protested his innocence in the strongest terms
passive: Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner
novoice: the magistrate refused
active:  to deal summarily with the offence
active:  referred it to the Assizes
noverb:  Horner
active:  had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings
novoice: fainted away at the conclusion
passive: was carried out of court
noverb:  Hum
noverb:  much for the police-court
active:  said Holmes thoughtfully
noverb:  tossing aside the paper
noverb:  The question for us now
active:  to solve
noverb:  is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important
noverb:  less innocent aspect
active:  Here is the stone
active:  the stone came from the goose
active:  the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with
active:  I have bored you
active:  now we must set ourselves very seriously
active:  to finding this gentleman
active:  ascertaining
noverb:  part he has played in this little mystery
active:  To do this
active:  we must try the simplest means first
noverb:  these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers
noverb:  this fail
active:  I shall have recourse to other methods
active:  will you say
noverb:  Give me a pencil
noverb:  slip of paper
noverb:  Now,
passive: Found at the corner of Goodge Street
noverb:  a goose
noverb:  a black felt hat
active:  Mr. Henry Baker can have the same
active:  applying at 6
noverb:  30 this evening at 221B
noverb:  Baker Street
active:  That is clear and concise
noverb:  Very
active:  will he see it
noverb:  Well,
active:  he is sure
active:  to keep an eye on the papers
active:  , to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one
active:  He was clearly
passive: scared by his mischance
active:  breaking the window
noverb:  by the approach of Peterson
noverb:  he thought of nothing
noverb:  flight
active:  he must have bitterly regretted the impulse
active:  caused him
active:  to drop his bird
noverb:  again
active:  the introduction of his name will cause him
active:  to see it
noverb:  for everyone
noverb:  knows him will direct his attention to it
noverb:  Here you are
noverb:  Peterson
active:  run down to the advertising agency
active:  have this put in the evening papers
noverb:  In
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others
active:  occur to
noverb:  you
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And this stone
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I shall keep the stone
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  just buy a goose on your way back
noverb:  leave it here with me
noverb:  for we must have one
active:  to give to this gentleman in place of the one
active:  your family is now devouring
active:  When the commissionaire had gone
active:  Holmes took up the stone
active:  held it against the light
active:  It's a bonny thing
active:  said he
noverb:  Just see
active:  it glints and sparkles
noverb:  Of course
active:  it is a nucleus and focus of crime
active:  Every good stone is
active:  They are the devil's pet baits
active:  In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
active:  This stone is not
noverb:  twenty years old
passive: It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China
active:  is remarkable
active:  having every characteristic of the carbuncle
active:  save
active:  it is blue
noverb:  in shade instead of ruby red
noverb:  In spite of its youth
active:  it has already a sinister history
active:  There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies
novoice: brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight
active:  crystallised charcoal
active:  would think
noverb:  pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison
active:  I'll lock it up in my strong box now
noverb:  drop a line to the Countess
active:  to say
active:  we have it
active:  Do you think
active:  this man Horner is innocent
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Well,
active:  do you imagine
active:  this other one, Henry Baker, had anything
active:  to do with the matter
active:  It is
active:  I think
noverb:  much more likely
active:  Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man
active:  had no idea
noverb:  the bird
active:  he was carrying
active:  was of considerably more value
passive: it were made of solid gold
noverb:  however
active:  I shall determine by a very simple test
active:  we have an answer to our advertisement
active:  And you can do nothing until
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I shall continue my professional round
active:  But I shall come back in the evening at the hour
active:  you have mentioned
noverb:  for I should like to see the solution of
active:  tangled a business
noverb:  Very glad
active:  to see you
active:  I dine at seven
active:  There is a woodcock
active:  I believe
active:  By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson
active:  to examine its crop
passive: I had been delayed at a case
active:  it was a little after half-past six
active:  I found myself in Baker Street once
active:  As I approached the house
active:  I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat
passive: was buttoned up to his chin waiting
noverb:  in the bright semicircle
passive: was thrown from the fanlight
noverb:  Just
active:  I arrived the door
passive: was opened
passive: we were shown up together to Holmes' room
noverb:  Mr. Henry Baker
active:  I believe
active:  said he
noverb:  rising from his armchair
active:  greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality
active:  he could
active:  readily assume
noverb:  Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker
active:  It is a cold night
active:  I observe
active:  your circulation is more adapted for summer
noverb:  for winter
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have just come at the right time
active:  Is
noverb:  your hat, Mr. Baker
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that is undoubtedly my hat
active:  He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head,
noverb:  a broad, intelligent face
noverb:  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown
noverb:  A touch of red in nose
active:  cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits
noverb:  His rusty black frock-coat
passive: was buttoned right up in front
novoice: with the collar turned up
active:  his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
active:  He spoke in a slow staccato fashion
active:  choosing his words with care
active:  gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters
active:  had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune
active:  We have retained these things for some days
active:  said Holmes
active:  we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address
active:  I am at a loss
active:  to know now
active:  you did not advertise
active:  Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
active:  Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
active:  he remarked
active:  I had no doubt
noverb:  the gang of roughs
noverb:  assaulted me had carried off
noverb:  my hat and the bird
active:  I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt
active:  recovering them
noverb:  Very naturally
passive: By the way, about the bird, we were compelled
active:  to eat it
active:  To eat it
noverb:  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would have been
active:  of no use to anyone had we not done
active:  But I presume
noverb:  this other goose upon the sideboard
active:  is about the same weight
noverb:  perfectly fresh
active:  will answer your purpose equally well
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  certainly
active:  answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief
noverb:  Of course
active:  we still have the feathers, legs, crop
noverb:  on of your own bird
noverb:  you wish
noverb:  The man burst into a hearty laugh
active:  They might be useful
noverb:  to me as relics of my adventure
active:  said he
noverb:  beyond
active:  I can hardly see
noverb:  use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going
active:  to be to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I think
active:  , with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird
active:  I perceive upon the sideboard
novoice: Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
active:  There is your hat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  there your bird
active:  said he
noverb:  By the way
active:  would it bore you
active:  to tell me
active:  you got the other one from
active:  I am somewhat of a fowl fancier
active:  I have seldom seen a better grown goose
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  sir
active:  said Baker
active:  had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm
active:  There are a few of us
active:  frequent the Alpha Inn
noverb:  near the Museum
active:  we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day
active:  you understand
noverb:  This year our good host
noverb:  Windigate by name
active:  instituted a goose club
noverb:  by
noverb:  on consideration of some few pence every week
active:  we were each
active:  to receive a bird at Christmas
passive: My pence were duly paid
active:  the rest is familiar to you
active:  I am much indebted
noverb:  to you
noverb:  sir
passive: for a Scotch bonnet is fitted
noverb:  to my years nor my gravity
active:  With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to
noverb:  of us
novoice: strode off upon his way
noverb:  much for Mr. Henry Baker
active:  said Holmes
active:  he had closed the door behind him
active:  It is quite certain
noverb:  that he knows nothing
noverb:  about the matter
active:  Are you hungry
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  Not particularly
active:  I suggest
active:  we turn our dinner into a supper
active:  follow up this clue
active:  it is still hot
noverb:  By all means
active:  It was a bitter night
active:  we drew on our ulsters
active:  wrapped cravats about our throats
active:  the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky
active:  the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
noverb:  so many pistol shots
active:  Our footfalls rang out crisply
noverb:  loudly
active:  we swung through the doctors' quarter
noverb:  Wimpole Street
noverb:  Harley Street
noverb:  through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street
active:  In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn
active:  is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets
noverb:  which runs down into Holborn
noverb:  Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar
active:  ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord
active:  Your beer should be excellent
active:  it is
noverb:  your geese
active:  said he
noverb:  My geese
active:  The man seemed surprised
noverb:  Yes
active:  I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  who was a member of your goose club
noverb:  Ah! yes
active:  I see
noverb:  you see
noverb:  sir
active:  them's not our geese
noverb:  Indeed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden
noverb:  Indeed
active:  I know some of them
active:  was it
active:  Breckinridge is his name
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  I don't know him
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  here's your good health landlord
noverb:  prosperity to your house
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Now for Mr. Breckinridge
active:  he continued
active:  buttoning up his coat
active:  we came out into the frosty air
active:  Remember
noverb:  Watson
active:  we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain
active:  we have at the other a man
active:  will certainly get seven years' penal servitude
active:  we can establish his innocence
active:  It is possible
noverb:  that our inquiry may
active:  confirm his guilt
active:  , in any case, we have a line of investigation
passive: has been missed by the police
active:  a singular chance has placed in our hands
noverb:  Let us follow it out to the bitter end
noverb:  Faces to the south
noverb:  quick march
active:  We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street,
noverb:  through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market
active:  One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it
noverb:  the proprietor a horsey-looking man
noverb:  with a sharp face
noverb:  trim side-whiskers was helping a boy
active:  to put up the shutters
noverb:  Good-evening
active:  It's a cold night
active:  said Holmes
novoice: The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
passive: Sold out of geese
active:  I see
active:  continued Holmes
noverb:  pointing at the bare slabs of marble
novoice: Let
active:  you have five hundred to-morrow morning
active:  That's no good
noverb:  Well,
active:  there are some
noverb:  on the stall with the gas-flare
noverb:  Ah
passive: I was recommended to
noverb:  you
noverb:  by
noverb:  The landlord of the Alpha
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  I sent him a couple of dozen
noverb:  Fine birds they were
noverb:  too
active:  Now where did you get them from
active:  To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  mister
active:  said he
novoice: with his head cocked
noverb:  his arms akimbo
active:  are you driving at
noverb:  Let's have it straight
noverb:  now
active:  It is straight enough
active:  I should like to know
noverb:  sold you the geese
active:  you supplied to the Alpha
noverb:  Well
noverb:  I shan't tell you
noverb:  now
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is a matter of no importance
noverb:  I don't know
active:  you should be so warm
noverb:  over such a trifle
noverb:  Warm
active:  You'd be
active:  warm
noverb:  maybe
active:  you were
active:  I am
active:  When I pay good money for a good article
active:  there should be an end of the business
active:  it's
active:  are the geese
noverb:  and 'Who did you sell the geese to
noverb:  and 'What will you take for the geese
active:  One would think
active:  they were the only geese
noverb:  in the world
active:  to hear the fuss
passive: is made over them
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no connection with any other people
active:  have been making inquiries
active:  said Holmes carelessly
noverb:  you won't tell us
active:  the bet is off
active:  that is all
noverb:  I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls
active:  I have a fiver on it
noverb:  the bird
active:  I ate
active:  is country
novoice: bred
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  you've lost your fiver
noverb:  for it's town
novoice: bred
active:  snapped the salesman
active:  It's nothing of the kind
active:  I say
active:  it is
noverb:  I don't believe it
noverb:  D'you think
active:  you know more about fowls
noverb:  I
active:  have handled them
active:  I was a nipper
active:  I tell you
noverb:  all those birds
active:  went to
noverb:  the Alpha were town bred
active:  You'll never persuade me
active:  to believe that
active:  Will you bet
active:  It's merely taking your money
noverb:  for I know
active:  I am right
active:  But I'll have a sovereign on with you
noverb:  just
active:  to teach you not
active:  to be obstinate
active:  The salesman chuckled grimly
noverb:  Bring me the books
noverb:  Bill
active:  said he
active:  The small boy brought round a small thin volume
noverb:  a great greasy-backed one
active:  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
noverb:  Now
noverb:  Mr. Cocksure
active:  said the salesman
active:  I thought
active:  I was out of geese
active:  I finish
active:  you'll find
active:  there is still one left in my shop
active:  You see this little book
noverb:  Well
active:  That's the list of the folk from
active:  I buy
noverb:  D'you see
noverb:  Well,
active:  here on this page are the country folk
active:  the numbers after their names are
active:  their accounts
active:  are in the big ledger
noverb:  Now,
active:  You see this other page in red ink
noverb:  Well,
active:  is a list of my town suppliers
noverb:  Now,
active:  look at
noverb:  third name
active:  Just read
noverb:  it out to me
noverb:  Mrs. Oakshott
noverb:  117
noverb:  Brixton Road

active:  read Holmes
noverb:  Quite

noverb:  up in the ledger
passive: Holmes turned
novoice: to the page indicated

active:  you are
noverb:  And underneath
passive: Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha
noverb:  at 12s
active:  have you
active:  to say now
active:  Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined
active:  He drew a sovereign from his pocket
active:  threw it down upon the slab
noverb:  turning away with the air of a man
active:  disgust is too deep for words
noverb:  A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post
active:  laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  When you see a man with whiskers of
noverb:  cut
noverb:  the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket
active:  you can always draw him by a bet
active:  said he
active:  I daresay
active:  I had put $100 down in front of him
noverb:  that man would not have given me such complete information
passive: was drawn from him by the idea
active:  he was doing me on a wager
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we are
active:  I fancy
active:  nearing the end of our quest
noverb:  the only point
active:  remains
passive: to be determined
active:  is
active:  we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night
active:  we should reserve it for to-morrow
active:  It is clear
noverb:  from
active:  surly fellow said
active:  there are others
noverb:  besides ourselves
active:  are anxious
noverb:  about the matter
active:  I should
passive: His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub
active:  broke out from the stall
active:  we had just left
noverb:  Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
passive: was thrown by the swinging lamp
noverb:  Breckinridge
noverb:  the salesman
active:  framed in the door of his stall
active:  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
noverb:  I've had enough of you and your geese
active:  he shouted
active:  I wish
novoice: you were all
noverb:  at the devil together
active:  you come
active:  pestering me any
noverb:  with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you
active:  You bring Mrs. Oakshott here
active:  I'll answer her
active:  have you
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  Did I buy the geese off you
noverb:  No
active:  one of them was mine all the same
active:  whined the little man
noverb:  Well,
active:  ask Mrs. Oakshott for it
active:  She told me
active:  to ask you
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can ask the King of Proosia
noverb:  for all I care
noverb:  I've had enough of it
active:  Get out of this
active:  He rushed fiercely forward
active:  the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
noverb:  Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  Come with me
active:  we will see
active:  is to be made of this fellow
active:  Striding through the scattered knots of people
active:  lounged round the flaring stalls
active:  my companion speedily overtook the little man
active:  touched him upon the shoulder
active:  He sprang round
active:  I could see in the gas-light
passive: every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
active:  are you
noverb:  do you want
active:  he asked in a quavering voice
active:  You will excuse me
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  I could not help
active:  overhearing the questions
noverb:  you put to the salesman just now
active:  I think
active:  I could be of assistance to you
noverb:  You
active:  are you
active:  could you know anything of the matter
active:  My name is Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is my business
active:  to know
noverb:  other people don't know
active:  you can know nothing of this
active:  Excuse me
active:  I know everything of it
active:  You are endeavouring to trace some geese
passive: were sold
active:  by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge
noverb:  by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club
noverb:  of
active:  Mr. Henry Baker is a member
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  sir
active:  you are the
noverb:  very man
active:  I have longed
active:  to meet
active:  cried the little fellow with outstretched hands
noverb:  quivering fingers
active:  I can hardly explain to
noverb:  you
noverb:  interested I am in this matter
active:  Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler
active:  was passing
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  we had
active:  better discuss it in a cosy room rather
noverb:  in this wind-swept market-place
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  we go farther
active:  it is
active:  I have the pleasure
active:  assisting
active:  The man hesitated for an instant
active:  My name is John Robinson
active:  he answered with a sidelong glance
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the real name
active:  said Holmes sweetly
active:  It is always awkward doing business with an alias
active:  A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
noverb:  Well
active:  said he
active:  my real name is James Ryder
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan
active:  Pray step into the cab
active:  I shall soon be able
noverb:  to tell you everything
active:  you would wish
active:  to know
noverb:  The little man
novoice: stood
active:  glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes
noverb:  as one
active:  is not sure
active:  he is on the verge of a windfall
noverb:  of a catastrophe
active:  he stepped into the cab
noverb:  in half an hour
active:  we were back
noverb:  in the sitting-room at Baker Street
passive: Nothing had been said during our drive
noverb:  the high
noverb:  thin breathing of our new companion
noverb:  the claspings and unclaspings of his hands
noverb:  spoke of the nervous tension within him
noverb:  Here we are
active:  said Holmes cheerily
active:  we filed into the room
active:  The fire looks very seasonable in this weather
active:  You look cold
noverb:  Mr. Ryder
noverb:  Pray take the basket-chair
active:  I will just put on my slippers
active:  we settle this little matter of yours
noverb:  Now,
active:  You want to know
active:  became of those geese
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Or rather
active:  I fancy
noverb:  of that goose
active:  It was one bird
active:  I imagine in
passive: you were interested
noverb:  white
noverb:  with a black bar across the tail
active:  Ryder quivered with emotion
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  sir
active:  he cried
active:  can you tell me
active:  it went to
active:  It came here
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  a most remarkable bird
active:  it proved
noverb:  I don't wonder
active:  you should take an interest in it
active:  It laid an egg after
active:  it was dead
noverb:  --the bonniest
noverb:  brightest little blue egg
passive: ever was seen
active:  I have it here in my museum
active:  Our visitor staggered to his feet
active:  clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand
active:  Holmes unlocked his strong-box
active:  held up the blue carbuncle
novoice: shone out
noverb:  a star
noverb:  with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance
active:  Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to claim
active:  to disown it
noverb:  The game's up
noverb:  Ryder
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  Hold up
noverb:  man
active:  you'll be into the fire
active:  Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson
active:  He's not got blood enough
active:  to go in for felony with impunity
noverb:  Give him a dash of brandy
active:  Now he looks a little more human
noverb:  a shrimp
active:  it is
active:  to be sure
active:  For a moment he had staggered
noverb:  nearly fallen
novoice: the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks
active:  he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
active:  I have almost every link in my hands
noverb:  all the proofs
active:  I could possibly need
active:  there is little
noverb:  which you need
active:  tell me
noverb:  Still,
passive: that little may as well be cleared up
active:  to make the case complete
active:  You had heard
noverb:  Ryder
noverb:  of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?
active:  It was Catherine Cusack
noverb:  who told me of it
active:  said he in a crackling voice
active:  I see
noverb:  her ladyship's waiting-maid
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the temptation of sudden wealth
noverb:  easily acquired was too much for you
active:  it has been for better men
noverb:  you
active:  you were not very scrupulous
active:  in the means you used
active:  It seems to me
noverb:  Ryder
active:  there is the making
noverb:  of a very pretty villain in you
active:  You knew
passive: this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before
active:  that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--
active:  you managed
active:  he should be the man
novoice: sent for
active:  he had left
active:  you rifled the jewel-case
active:  raised the alarm
active:  had this unfortunate man arrested
noverb:  You
active:  Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug
novoice: clutched at my companion's knees
noverb:  For God's sake
active:  have mercy
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  Think of my father
noverb:  Of my mother
active:  It would break their hearts
active:  I never went wrong before
active:  I never will again
active:  I swear it
active:  I'll swear it on a Bible
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  don't bring it into court
noverb:  For Christ's sake
noverb:  don't
active:  Get back into your chair
active:  said Holmes sternly
active:  It is very well
active:  to cringe and crawl now
active:  you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of
active:  he knew nothing
active:  I will fly
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I will leave the country, sir
active:  the charge against him will break down
noverb:  Hum
active:  We will talk about that
noverb:  And now let us hear a true account of the next act
active:  came the stone into the goose
active:  came the goose into the open market
noverb:  Tell us the truth
active:  for there lies your only hope of safety
active:  Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
noverb:  I will tell you it just
novoice: it happened
noverb:  sir
active:  said he
passive: When Horner had been arrested
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  it would be best
noverb:  for me
active:  to get away with the stone at once
noverb:  for I did not know at
noverb:  moment the police might not take it into their heads
active:  to search me and my room
active:  There was no place
noverb:  about the hotel
active:  it would be safe
active:  I went out
noverb:  as
noverb:  on some commission
active:  I made for my sister's house
active:  She had married a man
active:  named Oakshott
novoice: lived in Brixton Road
active:  she fattened fowls for the market
noverb:  All the way there every man
active:  I met
novoice: seemed to me
active:  to be a policeman or a detective
noverb:  and,
noverb:  for all
active:  it was a cold night
active:  the sweat was pouring down my face
active:  I came to the Brixton Road
active:  My sister asked me
active:  was the matter
active:  I was so pale
active:  I told her
passive: I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel
active:  Then I went into the back yard

noverb:  that I heard it
noverb:  among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house
passive: I may possibly have been deceived
noverb:  Was your sister dressed
noverb:  No
active:  she was in her night-dress
active:  In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match
noverb:  in her left a match-box
active:  Showing
active:  she had struck a light
novoice: looked about her
active:  the alarm took place
active:  That is important
noverb:  And
noverb:  conclusions did the coroner come to
active:  He investigated the case with great care
novoice: for Dr. Roylott's conduct had
active:  long been notorious in the county
active:  he was unable
active:  to find any satisfactory cause of death
active:  My evidence showed
passive: the door had been fastened upon the inner side
passive: the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
passive: were secured every night
passive: The walls were carefully sounded
passive: were shown
active:  to be quite solid all round
passive: the flooring was also thoroughly examined
noverb:  with the same result
active:  The chimney is wide
passive: is barred up by four large staples
active:  It is certain
noverb:  , therefore
active:  my sister was quite alone
noverb:  she met her end
noverb:  Besides
active:  there were no marks
noverb:  of any violence upon her
noverb:  about poison
active:  The doctors examined her for it
noverb:  without success
active:  do you think
active:  this unfortunate lady died of
active:  It is my belief
noverb:  that she died of pure fear
noverb:  nervous shock
active:  it was
noverb:  frightened her I cannot imagine
noverb:  Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
noverb:  Yes
active:  there are nearly always some
noverb:  there
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  did you gather from this allusion to a band
noverb:  a speckled band
active:  Sometimes I have thought
active:  it was merely the wild talk of delirium
noverb:  sometimes
active:  it may have referred to some band of people
noverb:  perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
active:  I do not know
noverb:  the spotted handkerchiefs
noverb:  so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective
active:  she used
active:  Holmes shook his head like a man
noverb:  who is far
noverb:  from being satisfied
noverb:  These are very deep waters
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  go on with your narrative
active:  Two years have passed
novoice: my life has been until lately lonelier
noverb:  A month ago
noverb:  however
noverb:  a dear friend
active:  I have known for many years
noverb:  has done me the honour
active:  to ask my hand in marriage
active:  His name is Armitage
noverb:  Percy Armitage
noverb:  the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading
active:  My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match
active:  we are to be married in the course of the spring
noverb:  Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building
passive: my bedroom wall has been pierced
active:  I have had
active:  to move into the chamber in
novoice: my sister died
active:  to sleep in the very bed in
active:  she slept
active:  Imagine
noverb:  my thrill of terror
noverb:  last night
noverb:  as I lay awake
noverb:  thinking over her terrible fate
novoice: I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle
active:  had been the herald of her own death
active:  I sprang up
active:  lit the lamp
active:  nothing was to be seen in the room
active:  I was too shaken
active:  to go
active:  to bed again
noverb:  however
active:  I dressed
active:  it was daylight
active:  I slipped down
active:  got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn
active:  is opposite
active:  drove to Leatherhead
noverb:  from whence I have come on this morning with the one object
active:  seeing you
active:  asking your advice
active:  You have done wisely
active:  said my friend
active:  have you told me all
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  all
noverb:  Miss Roylott
active:  you have not
active:  You are screening your stepfather
noverb:  do you mean
active:  For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace
active:  fringed the hand
active:  lay upon our visitor's knee
noverb:  Five little livid spots
noverb:  the marks of four fingers and a thumb
passive: were printed upon the white wrist
passive: You have been cruelly used
active:  said Holmes
active:  The lady coloured deeply
novoice: covered over her injured wrist
active:  He is a hard man
active:  she said
active:  and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
active:  There was a long silence
noverb:  during
active:  Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands
novoice: stared into the crackling fire
active:  This is a very deep business
active:  he said at last
active:  There are a thousand details
active:  I should desire to know
active:  I decide upon our course of action
active:  Yet we have not a moment
active:  to lose
active:  we were
active:  to come to Stoke Moran to-day
active:  would
active:  it be possible
noverb:  for us
active:  to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
active:  it happens
noverb:  he spoke
active:  coming into town to-day upon some most important business
active:  It is probable
noverb:  that he will be away all day
active:  there would be nothing
active:  to disturb you
active:  We have a housekeeper now
active:  she is old and foolish
active:  I could easily get her out of the way
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You are not averse
noverb:  to this trip, Watson
noverb:  By no means
active:  we shall
active:  come
active:  are you going to do yourself
active:  I have one or two things
active:  I would wish to do now
active:  I am in town
active:  But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train
active:  to be there in time for your coming
active:  And you may expect us early in the afternoon
noverb:  I have myself some small business matters
active:  to attend to
active:  Will you not wait and breakfast
noverb:  No
active:  I must go
passive: My heart is lightened already
active:  I have confided my trouble to you
noverb:  I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
active:  She dropped her thick black veil over her face
novoice: glided from the room
noverb:  And
noverb:  do you think of it all
noverb:  Watson
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  It seems to me
active:  to be a most dark and sinister business
noverb:  Dark enough
noverb:  sinister enough
noverb:  Yet
active:  the lady is correct
active:  saying
noverb:  the flooring
active:  walls are sound
active:  the door, window, and chimney are impassable
active:  her sister must have been undoubtedly alone
noverb:  she met her mysterious end
active:  becomes
noverb:  , of these nocturnal whistles,
noverb:  of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
active:  I cannot think
active:  When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
noverb:  the presence of a band of gipsies
active:  are on intimate terms with this old doctor
noverb:  the fact
active:  we have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  the doctor has an interest
active:  preventing his stepdaughter's marriage
noverb:  the dying allusion to a band
noverb:  finally
noverb:  the fact
novoice: Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang
passive: might have been caused by one of those metal bars
active:  secured the shutters falling back into its place
active:  I think
passive: there is good ground
active:  to think
passive: the mystery may be cleared along those lines
active:  did the gipsies
active:  do
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  I see many objections to any such theory
noverb:  And
active:  do
active:  I. It is precisely for
noverb:  reason
active:  we are going to Stoke Moran this day
active:  I want
active:  to see
active:  the objections are fatal
passive: they may be explained away
noverb:  in the name of the devil
passive: The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact
active:  our door had been suddenly dashed open
active:  a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
active:  His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional
noverb:  of the agricultural
active:  having a black top-hat
noverb:  , a long frock-coat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a pair of high gaiters
noverb:  with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand
noverb:  So tall was he
active:  his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway
active:  his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
noverb:  A large face
passive: seared with a thousand wrinkles
noverb:  burned yellow with the sun
novoice: marked with every evil passion
passive: was turned from one to the other of us
noverb:  his deep-set, bile-shot eyes
noverb:  his high
noverb:  thin
noverb:  fleshless nose
noverb:  gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
noverb:  of
active:  you is Holmes
active:  asked this apparition
noverb:  My name
noverb:  sir
active:  you have the advantage of me
active:  said my companion quietly
active:  I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  , of Stoke Moran
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said Holmes blandly
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  I will do nothing of the kind
active:  My stepdaughter has been here
active:  I have traced her
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  It is a little cold for the time of the year
active:  said Holmes
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  screamed the old man furiously
active:  I have heard
noverb:  the crocuses promise well
active:  continued my companion imperturbably
noverb:  Ha
active:  You put me off
active:  do you
active:  said
noverb:  our new visitor
active:  taking a step forward
active:  shaking his hunting-crop
active:  I know you
noverb:  you scoundrel
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you before
active:  You are Holmes, the meddler
active:  My friend smiled
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the busybody
active:  His smile broadened
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office
active:  Holmes chuckled heartily
active:  Your conversation is most entertaining
active:  said he
active:  When you go out close the door
active:  for there is a decided draught
active:  I will go
active:  I have said my say
noverb:  Don't you dare
active:  to meddle with my affairs
active:  I know
active:  Miss Stoner has been here
active:  I traced her
active:  I am a dangerous man
active:  to fall foul of
noverb:  See here
active:  He stepped swiftly forward
active:  seized the poker
active:  bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
active:  See
active:  you keep yourself out of my grip
active:  he snarled
active:  hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace
active:  he strode out of the room
active:  He seems a very amiable person
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I am not quite so bulky
active:  he had remained
active:  I might have shown him
active:  my grip was not much more feeble
noverb:  his own
active:  he spoke
active:  he picked up the steel poker
active:  , with a sudden effort, straightened it out again
noverb:  Fancy his having the insolence
active:  to confound me with the official detective force
noverb:  This incident gives zest to our investigation
noverb:  however
noverb:  I only trust
active:  our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence
active:  allowing this brute
active:  to trace her
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall order breakfast
active:  afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons
active:  I hope to get some data
active:  may help us in this matter
active:  It was nearly one
noverb:  o'clock
novoice: Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion
active:  He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper
noverb:  scrawled over with notes and figures
active:  I have seen the will of the deceased wife
active:  said he
active:  To determine its exact meaning
passive: I have been obliged
active:  to work out the present prices of the investments with
passive: it is concerned
noverb:  The total income
active:  at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100
active:  is now
noverb:  through the fall in agricultural prices
noverb:  not more than $750
active:  Each daughter can claim an income of $250
noverb:  in case of marriage
active:  It is evident
noverb:  , therefore
active:  both girls had married
active:  this beauty would have had a mere pittance
active:  even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
passive: My morning's work has not been wasted
active:  it has proved
active:  he has the very strongest motives
active:  standing in the way of anything of the sort
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  this is too serious for dawdling
noverb:  especially
active:  the old man is aware
active:  we are interesting ourselves in his affairs
active:  you are ready
noverb:  , we shall call a cab
noverb:  drive to Waterloo
active:  I should be very much obliged
active:  you would slip your revolver into your pocket
noverb:  An Eley's No
active:  2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
active:  can twist steel pokers into knots
active:  a tooth-brush are
active:  I think
noverb:  all
active:  we need
noverb:  At Waterloo
active:  we were fortunate
noverb:  in catching a train for Leatherhead
active:  we hired a trap at the station inn
active:  drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes
active:  It was a perfect day
noverb:  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
noverb:  The trees
active:  wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots
active:  the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
noverb:  To me at least
active:  there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon
passive: we were engaged
noverb:  My companion sat in the front of the trap
noverb:  his arms folded
active:  his hat pulled down over his eyes
active:  his chin sunk upon his breast
active:  buried in the deepest thought
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  he started
active:  tapped me on the shoulder
novoice: pointed over the meadows
noverb:  Look there
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
noverb:  thickening into a grove at the highest point
noverb:  From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
noverb:  high roof-tree of a very old mansion
noverb:  Stoke Moran
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  remarked the driver
active:  There is some building going on there
active:  said Holmes
active:  that is
active:  we are going
active:  There's the village
active:  said the driver
active:  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left
active:  you want
active:  to get to the house
active:  you'll find it shorter
active:  to get over this stile
noverb:  by the foot-path over the fields
noverb:  There
active:  it is
active:  the lady is walking
noverb:  And the lady
active:  I fancy
active:  is Miss Stoner
active:  observed Holmes
active:  shading his eyes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I think
active:  we had
active:  better do
active:  you suggest
active:  We got off
active:  paid our fare
active:  the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
active:  I thought it as well
active:  said Holmes
active:  we climbed the stile
active:  this fellow should think
active:  we had come here as architects
noverb:  on some definite business
active:  It may stop his gossip
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  You see
active:  we have been
noverb:  our word
active:  Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
noverb:  spoke her joy
active:  I have been waiting
noverb:  eagerly for you
active:  she cried
noverb:  shaking hands with us warmly
noverb:  All has turned out splendidly
active:  Dr. Roylott has gone to town
active:  it is unlikely
noverb:  that he will be back
noverb:  before evening
active:  We have had the pleasure
active:  making the doctor's acquaintance
active:  said Holmes
active:  in a few words he sketched out
active:  had occurred
active:  Miss Stoner turned white to the lips
active:  she listened
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  she cried
active:  he has followed me
active:  it appears
active:  He is so cunning
noverb:  that I never know
active:  I am safe
noverb:  from him
active:  will he say
active:  he returns
active:  He must guard himself
noverb:  for he may find
active:  there is someone
noverb:  more cunning
noverb:  himself upon his track
active:  You must lock yourself up from him to-night
active:  he is violent
noverb:  , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow
noverb:  Now,
active:  we must make the best use of our time
noverb:  kindly take us at once to the rooms
active:  we are
active:  to examine
active:  The building was of grey
noverb:  lichen-blotched stone
noverb:  with a high central portion
active:  two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side
passive: In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards
passive: the roof was partly caved in
noverb:  a picture of ruin
active:  The central portion was in little better repair
active:  the right-hand block was comparatively modern
noverb:  the blinds in the windows
active:  with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys
active:  showed
active:  this was
active:  the family resided
passive: Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall
passive: the stone-work had been broken into
active:  there were no signs
noverb:  of any workmen at the moment of our visit
active:  Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn
active:  examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
noverb:  This
active:  I take it
active:  belongs to the room in
noverb:  you used
active:  to sleep
noverb:  the centre one to your sister's
noverb:  the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber
noverb:  Exactly
active:  But I am now sleeping in the middle one
active:  Pending the alterations
active:  I understand
noverb:  By the way
active:  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at
noverb:  end wall
active:  There were none
active:  I believe
active:  it was an excuse
active:  to move me from my room
noverb:  Ah!
active:  is suggestive
noverb:  Now,
active:  on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from
active:  these three rooms open
active:  There are windows
noverb:  in it
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  very small ones
noverb:  Too narrow for anyone
active:  to pass through
noverb:  As you
active:  locked your doors at night
active:  your rooms were unapproachable from
noverb:  side
noverb:  Now,
active:  would you have the kindness
active:  to go into your room
noverb:  bar your shutters
active:  Miss Stoner did
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  after a careful examination through the open window
active:  endeavoured in every way
active:  to force the shutter open
noverb:  without success
active:  There was no slit through
passive: a knife could be passed
active:  to raise the bar
noverb:  with his lens
active:  he tested the hinges
active:  they were of solid iron
active:  built firmly into the massive masonry
noverb:  Hum
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  scratching his chin in some perplexity
active:  my theory certainly presents some difficulties
active:  No one could pass these shutters
passive: they were bolted
noverb:  Well,
active:  we shall see
noverb:  the inside throws any light upon the matter
passive: A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from
active:  the three bedrooms opened
active:  Holmes refused
active:  to examine the third chamber
active:  we passed at once to the second
noverb:  in
active:  Miss Stoner was now sleeping
noverb:  in
active:  her sister had met with her fate
active:  It was a homely little room
noverb:  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace
noverb:  after the fashion of old country-houses
active:  A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner
noverb:  a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another
noverb:  a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window
active:  These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre
noverb:  The boards round
active:  the panelling of the walls were of brown
noverb:  worm-eaten oak
noverb:  old
active:  discoloured
active:  it may have dated from the original building of the house
active:  Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner
active:  sat silent
active:  his eyes travelled round
noverb:  round
noverb:  up and down
noverb:  taking in every detail of the apartment
active:  Where does
active:  bell communicate with
active:  he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope
active:  hung down beside the bed
active:  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
active:  It goes to the housekeeper's room
active:  It looks newer
noverb:  the other things
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  it was only put there a couple of years ago
novoice: Your sister asked for
noverb:  it
active:  I suppose
noverb:  No
active:  I never heard of her using it
active:  We used always to get
active:  we wanted for ourselves
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it seemed unnecessary
active:  to put
noverb:  nice a bell-pull there
active:  You will excuse me for a few minutes
active:  I satisfy myself as to this floor
active:  He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
active:  crawled swiftly backward and forward
active:  examining minutely the cracks between the boards
active:  he did the same with the wood-work with
passive: the chamber was panelled
active:  Finally he walked over to the bed
novoice: spent some time
active:  staring at
noverb:  it
active:  running his eye up and down the wall
active:  Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand
noverb:  gave it a brisk tug
active:  it's a dummy
active:  said he
noverb:  Won't
active:  it ring
noverb:  No
passive: it is not even attached to a wire
active:  This is very interesting
active:  You can see now
passive: it is fastened to a hook just above
active:  the little opening for the ventilator is
noverb:  very absurd
active:  I never noticed
noverb:  before
noverb:  Very strange
active:  muttered Holmes
noverb:  pulling at the rope
noverb:  There are one or two very singular points about this room
noverb:  For example
noverb:  a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
active:  , with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the
noverb:  air
active:  That is also quite modern
active:  said the lady
active:  Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  there were several little changes carried out about
noverb:  time
active:  They seem
novoice: to have been of a most interesting character
noverb:  dummy bell-ropes
noverb:  ventilators
active:  do not ventilate
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
active:  Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger
noverb:  of his step-daughter
active:  was as plainly furnished
noverb:  A camp-bed
noverb:  a small wooden shelf full of books
noverb:  , mostly of a technical character
noverb:  an armchair beside the bed
active:  a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron
active:  safe were the principal things
active:  met the eye
active:  Holmes walked slowly round
novoice: examined each
noverb:  all of them with the keenest interest
active:  What's in here
active:  he asked
active:  tapping the safe
noverb:  My stepfather's business papers
noverb:  Oh! you have seen inside
noverb:  Only once
noverb:  some years ago
active:  I remember
active:  it was full
noverb:  of papers
noverb:  There isn't a cat in it
noverb:  for example
noverb:  No
noverb:  a strange idea
noverb:  Well,
active:  look at this
active:  He took up a small saucer of milk
novoice: stood on the top of it
noverb:  No
noverb:  we don't keep a cat
active:  there is a cheetah and a baboon
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Well,
active:  a cheetah is just a big cat
active:  a saucer of milk does not go very far
active:  satisfying its wants
active:  I daresay
active:  There is one point
active:  I should wish
active:  to determine
active:  He squatted down in front of the wooden chair
active:  examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
active:  Thank you
active:  That is quite settled
active:  said he
active:  rising and putting his lens in his pocket
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Here is something interesting
noverb:  The object
active:  had caught
noverb:  his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
noverb:  The lash
noverb:  however
active:  was curled upon itself
noverb:  tied
active:  to make a loop of whipcord
noverb:  do you make of
noverb:  Watson
active:  It's a common enough lash
noverb:  But I don't know
passive: it should be tied
active:  That is not quite
noverb:  common
active:  is it
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  me! it's a wicked world
active:  a clever man turns his brains
active:  to crime
active:  it is the worst of all
active:  I think
active:  I have seen enough now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
noverb:  with your permission
active:  we shall walk out upon the lawn
active:  I had never seen my friend's face so grim
noverb:  his brow
noverb:  dark
active:  it was
active:  we turned from the scene of this investigation
active:  We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking
active:  to break in upon his thoughts
active:  he roused himself from his reverie
active:  It is very essential
noverb:  , Miss Stoner
active:  said he
active:  you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
active:  I shall most certainly do
active:  The matter is too serious for any hesitation
active:  Your life may depend upon your compliance
active:  I assure you
active:  I am in your hands
noverb:  In the first place
noverb:  my friend
active:  I must spend the night in your room
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  I gazed at him in astonishment
noverb:  Yes
active:  it must be
noverb:  Let me explain
active:  I believe
active:  is the village inn over there
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is the Crown
noverb:  Very good
active:  Your windows would be visible from there
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
active:  your stepfather comes back
noverb:  you hear him retire for the night
active:  you must open the shutters of your window
active:  undo the hasp
noverb:  put your lamp there as a signal to us
active:  withdraw quietly with everything
active:  you are likely
active:  to want into the room
active:  you used
active:  to occupy
active:  I have no doubt
active:  , in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  easily
noverb:  The rest
active:  you will leave in our hands
active:  will
active:  you do
active:  We shall spend the night in your room
active:  we shall investigate the cause of this noise
active:  has disturbed you
active:  I believe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have already made up your mind
active:  said Miss Stoner
active:  laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
active:  Perhaps I have
active:  , for pity's sake, tell me
active:  was the cause of my sister's death
active:  I should prefer to have clearer proofs
active:  I speak
active:  You can at least tell me
active:  my own thought is correct
active:  she died from some sudden fright
noverb:  No
active:  I do not think
active:  I think
active:  there was probably some
noverb:  more tangible cause
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we must leave you for
novoice: Dr. Roylott returned and saw us
active:  our journey would be in vain
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  be brave
noverb:  for
active:  you will do
active:  I have told you
active:  you may rest assured
noverb:  we shall soon drive away the dangers
active:  threaten you
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  engaging a bedroom
noverb:  sitting-room at the Crown Inn
active:  They were on the upper floor
noverb:  from our window
active:  we could command a view of the avenue gate
noverb:  of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House
active:  At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  drive past
active:  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad
active:  drove him
active:  The boy had some slight difficulty
active:  undoing the heavy iron gates
active:  we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice
active:  saw the fury with
active:  he shook his clinched fists at him
active:  The trap drove on
noverb:  a few minutes later we saw a sudden light
active:  spring up among the trees
passive: the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness
active:  I have really some scruples as
active:  to taking you to-night
active:  There is a distinct element of danger
active:  Can I be of assistance
active:  Your presence might be invaluable
active:  I shall certainly come
active:  It is very kind
noverb:  of you
active:  You speak of danger
active:  You have evidently seen more in these rooms
active:  was visible to me
noverb:  No
active:  I fancy
active:  I may have deduced a little
active:  I imagine
active:  you saw all
active:  I did
noverb:  I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope
noverb:  purpose
active:  could answer
active:  I confess
active:  is more than
active:  I can imagine
active:  You saw the ventilator
noverb:  too
noverb:  Yes
active:  I do not think
active:  it is such
noverb:  a very unusual thing
active:  to have a small
active:  opening between two rooms
active:  It was so small
noverb:  that a rat could hardly pass through
active:  I knew
active:  we should find a ventilator
active:  we came to Stoke Moran
noverb:  My dear Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I did
active:  You remember in her statement
active:  she said
active:  her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  of course
active:  suggested at once
active:  there must be a communication
noverb:  between the two rooms
noverb:  It could only be a small one
passive: it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
active:  I deduced a ventilator
noverb:  harm can there be in that
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
passive: A ventilator is made
passive: a cord is hung
noverb:  a lady
noverb:  sleeps in the bed dies
active:  Does not
active:  strike you
active:  I cannot as yet see any connection
active:  Did you observe anything very peculiar
noverb:  about
noverb:  bed
noverb:  No
passive: It was clamped to the floor
active:  Did you
noverb:  see a bed fastened like
noverb:  before
active:  I cannot say
active:  I have
noverb:  The lady could not move her bed
active:  It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator
noverb:  to the rope
active:  we may call it
passive: it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  I seem
active:  to see dimly
active:  you are hinting at
active:  We are only just in time
active:  to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
noverb:  Subtle enough and horrible enough
active:  When a doctor does go wrong
active:  he is the first of criminals
active:  He has nerve
active:  he has knowledge
noverb:  Palmer
active:  Pritchard were among the heads of their profession
noverb:  This man strikes even deeper
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall be able
active:  to strike deeper still
active:  we shall have horrors enough
active:  the night is over
noverb:  for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe
noverb:  turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
noverb:  About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
noverb:  all was dark in the direction of the Manor House
active:  Two hours passed slowly away
noverb:  suddenly
noverb:  just at the stroke of eleven
active:  a single bright light shone out right in front of us
active:  That is our signal
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  springing to his feet
active:  it comes from the middle window
active:  we passed out
active:  he exchanged a few words with the landlord
active:  explaining
active:  we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that we might spend the night there
noverb:  A moment later
active:  we were out on the dark road
noverb:  a chill wind blowing in our faces
noverb:  one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom
active:  to guide us on our sombre errand
active:  There was little difficulty
active:  entering the grounds
noverb:  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
noverb:  Making our way among the trees
active:  we reached the lawn
active:  crossed it
active:  were about
active:  to enter through the window
noverb:  out from a clump of laurel bushes there
novoice: darted
novoice: seemed
active:  to be a hideous
noverb:  distorted child
active:  threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs
active:  ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
noverb:  My God
active:  I whispered
active:  did you see it
active:  Holmes was for the moment
active:  I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
active:  he broke into a low laugh
novoice: put his lips to my ear
active:  It is a nice household
active:  he murmured
active:  That is the baboon
active:  I had forgotten the strange pets
active:  the doctor affected
active:  There was a cheetah
noverb:  too
active:  perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
active:  I confess
active:  I felt easier in my mind
noverb:  after following Holmes' example
active:  slipping off my shoes
active:  I found myself inside the bedroom
active:  My companion noiselessly closed the shutters
active:  moved the lamp onto the table
noverb:  cast his eyes round the room
noverb:  All was
active:  we had seen it in the daytime
active:  creeping up to me
active:  making a trumpet of his hand
active:  he whispered into my ear again
noverb:  gently
active:  it was all
noverb:  that I could do to distinguish the words
active:  The least sound would be fatal to our plans
active:  I nodded to show
active:  I had heard
active:  We must sit without light
active:  He would see it through the ventilator
active:  I nodded again
active:  Do not go asleep
active:  your very life may depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  Have your pistol
active:  ready in case
active:  we should need it
active:  I will sit on the side of the bed
noverb:  you in
noverb:  chair
active:  I took out my revolver
active:  laid it on the corner of the table
active:  Holmes had brought up a long thin cane
noverb:  this
active:  he placed upon the bed beside him
active:  By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
active:  he turned down the lamp
passive: we were left in darkness
active:  shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil
active:  I could not hear a sound
noverb:  not even the drawing of a breath
active:  I knew
noverb:  my companion sat open-eyed
noverb:  within a few feet of me
noverb:  in the same state of nervous tension in
active:  I was myself
active:  The shutters cut off the least ray of light
active:  we waited in absolute darkness
noverb:  From
active:  came the occasional cry of a night-bird
noverb:  once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
active:  told us
active:  the cheetah was indeed at liberty
noverb:  Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock
active:  boomed out every quarter of an hour
noverb:  long they seemed
noverb:  those quarters
active:  Twelve struck
noverb:  one
noverb:  two
noverb:  three
active:  still we sat waiting silently for
active:  might befall
noverb:  Suddenly
active:  there was the momentary gleam
noverb:  of a light up in the direction of the ventilator
passive: vanished immediately
passive: was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil
noverb:  heated metal
active:  Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern
active:  I heard a gentle sound of movement
noverb:  all was silent once
active:  the smell grew stronger
noverb:  For half an hour
active:  I sat with straining ears
active:  suddenly another sound became audible
noverb:  a very gentle
noverb:  soothing sound
noverb:  like
active:  of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
noverb:  The instant
active:  we heard it
active:  Holmes sprang from the bed
active:  struck a match
novoice: lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
active:  You see it, Watson
active:  he yelled
active:  You see it
active:  I saw nothing
active:  At the moment when Holmes struck the light
active:  I heard a low
noverb:  clear whistle
active:  the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me
active:  to tell
active:  it was at
novoice: my friend lashed
noverb:  savagely
active:  I could
noverb:  however
noverb:  see
active:  his face was deadly pale
novoice: filled with horror and loathing
active:  He had ceased
active:  to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator
active:  suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to
active:  I have ever listened
active:  It swelled up louder
noverb:  louder
noverb:  a hoarse yell of pain
noverb:  fear
noverb:  anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
active:  They say
noverb:  away down in the village
noverb:  even in the distant parsonage
active:  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
active:  It struck cold to our hearts
active:  I stood
active:  gazing at Holmes
noverb:  he at me
active:  until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from
active:  it rose
active:  can it mean
active:  I gasped
active:  It means
active:  it is all
noverb:  over
active:  Holmes answered
active:  And perhaps, after all, it is for the best
noverb:  Take your pistol
active:  we will enter Dr. Roylott's room
active:  With a grave face he lit the lamp
active:  led the way down the corridor
active:  Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
active:  he turned the handle
active:  entered
noverb:  I at his heels
noverb:  with the cocked pistol in my hand
active:  It was a singular sight
active:  met our eyes
active:  On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open
active:  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe
noverb:  the door of
active:  was ajar
active:  Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  clad in a long grey dressing-gown
active:  his bare ankles protruding beneath
active:  his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers
active:  Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash
active:  we had noticed during the day
passive: His chin was cocked upward
passive: his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
noverb:  Round his brow
active:  he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles,
active:  seemed to be bound tightly round his head
active:  we entered
active:  he made
noverb:  sound
noverb:  motion
noverb:  The band! the speckled band
noverb:  whispered Holmes
active:  I took a step forward
active:  In an instant his strange headgear began
active:  to move
active:  there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head
noverb:  puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
active:  It is a swamp adder
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  the deadliest snake in India
active:  He has died within ten seconds
passive: being bitten
active:  Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent
noverb:  the schemer falls into the pit
active:  he digs for another
noverb:  Let us thrust this creature back into its den
active:  we can
noverb:  remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter
noverb:  let the county police know
active:  has happened
active:  he spoke
active:  he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
noverb:  throwing the noose round the reptile's neck
active:  he drew it from its horrid perch
active:  carrying it at arm's length
active:  threw it into the iron safe
active:  he closed upon
noverb:  it
active:  Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  of Stoke Moran
active:  It is not necessary
noverb:  that I should prolong a narrative
active:  has already run to too great a length
active:  telling
active:  we broke the sad news to the terrified girl
active:  we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow
noverb:  of
active:  the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
novoice: the doctor met his fate
active:  indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
noverb:  The little
active:  I had yet
active:  to learn
active:  of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
active:  I had
active:  said he
active:  come to an entirely erroneous conclusion
noverb:  shows
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  dangerous it always is
active:  to reason from insufficient data
noverb:  The presence of the gipsies
noverb:  the use of the word 'band
passive: was used by the poor girl, no doubt,
active:  to explain the appearance
active:  she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match
active:  were sufficient
active:  to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
active:  I can only claim the merit
noverb:  I
active:  reconsidered my position
noverb:  however
active:  it became clear to me
active:  danger threatened an occupant of the room
active:  could not come
noverb:  from the window or the door
passive: My attention was speedily drawn
active:  I have already remarked to
noverb:  you, to this ventilator,
noverb:  to the bell-rope
active:  hung down to the bed
noverb:  The discovery
active:  this was a dummy
passive: the bed was clamped to the floor
active:  gave rise to the suspicion
active:  the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole
noverb:  coming to the bed
noverb:  The idea of a snake
novoice: occurred to me
active:  I coupled it with my knowledge
passive: the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India
active:  I felt
active:  I was probably on the right track
noverb:  The idea
active:  using a form of poison
passive: could not possibly be discovered
active:  by any chemical test was just such a one
active:  would occur to a clever and ruthless man
active:  had had an Eastern training
noverb:  The rapidity with
active:  such a poison would take effect
noverb:  would also, from his point of view, be an advantage
active:  It would be a sharp-eyed coroner
noverb:  indeed
active:  could distinguish the two little dark punctures
active:  would show
active:  the poison fangs had done their work
noverb:  Then I thought of the whistle
noverb:  Of course he must recall the snake
active:  the morning light revealed it to the victim
active:  He had trained it
noverb:  probably by the use of the milk
active:  we saw
active:  to return to him
novoice: summoned
active:  He would put it through this ventilator at the hour
active:  he thought best
noverb:  with the certainty
active:  it would crawl down the rope
noverb:  land on the bed
active:  It might or might not bite the occupant
active:  perhaps she might escape every night for a week
noverb:  sooner
noverb:  later she must fall a victim
active:  I had come to these conclusions
active:  I had entered his room
active:  An inspection of his chair showed me
active:  he had been in the habit
active:  standing on
noverb:  it
noverb:  of course would be necessary in order
active:  he should reach the ventilator
noverb:  The sight of the safe
noverb:  the saucer of milk
active:  the loop of whipcord were enough
active:  to finally dispel any doubts
active:  may have remained
active:  The metallic clang heard
passive: by Miss Stoner was obviously caused
active:  by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
active:  Having once made up my mind
active:  you know the steps
active:  I took in order
active:  to put the matter to the proof
active:  I heard the creature hiss
active:  I have no doubt
active:  you did also
noverb:  I
active:  lit the light
active:  attacked it
noverb:  With the result
active:  driving it through the ventilator
noverb:  And also with the result
active:  causing it
active:  to turn upon its master at the other side
active:  Some of the blows of my cane came home
active:  roused its snakish temper
active:  it flew upon the first person
active:  it saw
noverb:  In this way
active:  I am no doubt
noverb:  indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death
active:  I cannot say
active:  it is likely
active:  to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
noverb:  IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
noverb:  Of all the problems
passive: have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy
active:  there were only two
noverb:  which I was the means
noverb:  of introducing to his notice
noverb:  of Mr. Hatherley's thumb
noverb:  of Colonel Warburton's madness
active:  Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer
active:  the other was so strange in its inception
noverb:  so dramatic in its details
active:  it may be the
noverb:  more worthy
passive: being placed upon record
noverb:  even
noverb:  it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods
active:  reasoning by
active:  he achieved such remarkable results
active:  The story has
active:  I believe
passive: been told more than once in the newspapers
active:  , like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking
noverb:  set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print
active:  the facts slowly evolve
noverb:  your own eyes
noverb:  the mystery clears gradually away
active:  each new discovery furnishes a step
active:  leads on to the complete truth
active:  At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me
active:  the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
active:  It was in the summer of '89
active:  not long after my marriage
active:  the events occurred
active:  I am now about
active:  to summarise
active:  I had returned to civil practice
active:  had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
active:  I continually visited him
active:  occasionally even persuaded him
active:  to forgo his Bohemian habits
active:  to come and visit us
active:  My practice had steadily increased
active:  I happened
active:  to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station
active:  I got a few patients from among the officials
noverb:  One of these
active:  I had cured of a painful
noverb:  lingering disease
active:  was never weary
active:  advertising my virtues
active:  endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over
active:  he might have any influence
noverb:  One morning
noverb:  at a little
noverb:  seven o'clock
passive: I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door
active:  to announce
active:  two men had come from Paddington
active:  were waiting in the consulting-room
active:  I dressed hurriedly
noverb:  for I knew by experience
active:  railway cases were seldom trivial
novoice: hastened downstairs
active:  As I descended
noverb:  my old ally
noverb:  the guard
active:  came out of the room
active:  closed the door tightly behind him
noverb:  I've got him here
active:  he whispered
active:  jerking his thumb over his shoulder
active:  he's all right
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  for his manner suggested
active:  it was some strange creature
noverb:  which he had caged up in my room
active:  It's a new patient
active:  he whispered
active:  I thought
noverb:  I'd bring him round myself
noverb:  he couldn't slip away
noverb:  There
active:  he is
noverb:  all safe
noverb:  sound
active:  I must go now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I have my dooties
noverb:  just the same as you
noverb:  And off he went
noverb:  this trusty tout
noverb:  without even giving me time
active:  to thank him
active:  I entered my consulting-room
novoice: found
active:  a gentleman seated by the table
passive: He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
active:  he had laid down upon my books
active:  Round one of his hands
noverb:  he had a handkerchief wrapped
passive: was mottled all over with bloodstains
active:  He was young
noverb:  , not more than five-and-twenty
active:  I should say
noverb:  with a strong, masculine face
active:  he was exceedingly pale
noverb:  and gave me the impression of a man
active:  was suffering from some strong agitation
active:  it took all his strength of mind
active:  to control
active:  I am sorry
active:  to knock you up
noverb:  early
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said he
active:  I have had a very serious accident during the night
active:  I came in by train this morning
active:  inquiring at Paddington as to
active:  I might find a doctor
noverb:  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
noverb:  I gave the maid a card
active:  I see
active:  she has left it upon the side-table
active:  I took it up
active:  glanced at
noverb:  it
noverb:  Mr. Victor Hatherley
noverb:  hydraulic engineer
noverb:  16A
noverb:  Victoria Street (3rd floor)
active:  That was the name, style
noverb:  abode of my morning visitor
active:  I regret
noverb:  I have kept you waiting
active:  said I
active:  sitting down in my library-chair
active:  You are fresh
noverb:  from a night journey
active:  I understand
active:  is in itself a monotonous occupation
noverb:  Oh
active:  my night could not be called monotonous
active:  said he
novoice: laughed
active:  He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair
active:  shaking his sides
active:  All my medical instincts rose up against
noverb:  laugh
noverb:  Stop it
active:  I cried
active:  pull yourself together
active:  and I poured out some water from a caraffe
active:  It was useless
noverb:  , however
active:  He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts
active:  come upon a strong nature
active:  some great crisis is over
noverb:  gone
active:  Presently he came to himself once
noverb:  very weary
noverb:  pale-looking
active:  I have been making a fool of myself
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Not at all
active:  Drink this
active:  I dashed some brandy into the water
active:  the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
active:  That's better
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb
noverb:  rather to the place
passive: my thumb used
active:  to be
active:  He unwound the handkerchief
active:  held out his hand
noverb:  It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder
active:  to look at it
active:  There were four protruding fingers
noverb:  a horrid red, spongy surface
active:  the thumb should
passive: have been
passive: It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  this is a terrible injury
active:  It must have bled considerably
noverb:  Yes
active:  it did
active:  I fainted
passive: it was done
active:  I think
active:  I must have been senseless for a long time
active:  When I came to
noverb:  I found
active:  it was still bleeding
active:  I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist
active:  braced it up with a twig
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You should have been a surgeon
active:  It is a question of hydraulics
noverb:  you see
active:  came within my own province
passive: This has been done
active:  said I
active:  examining the wound
noverb:  by a very heavy and sharp instrument
noverb:  A thing
noverb:  a cleaver
active:  said he
noverb:  An accident
active:  I presume
noverb:  By no means
noverb:  ! a murderous attack
noverb:  Very murderous indeed
active:  You horrify me
active:  I sponged the wound
active:  cleaned it
active:  dressed it
active:  finally covered it over with cotton wadding
noverb:  carbolised bandages
active:  He lay back
active:  wincing
active:  he bit his lip from time to time
active:  is that
active:  I asked
active:  I had finished
noverb:  Capital
active:  Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man
active:  I was very weak
active:  I have had a good deal
active:  to go through
active:  Perhaps you had better not
active:  speak of the matter
active:  It is evidently trying to your nerves
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  not now
active:  I shall have to tell my tale to the police
noverb:  between ourselves
active:  it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine
passive: I should be surprised
active:  they believed my statement
noverb:  for it is a very extraordinary one
active:  I have not much in the way of proof with
active:  to back it up
noverb:  and,
noverb:  even
active:  they believe me
noverb:  the clues
active:  I can give
active:  them are so vague
noverb:  that it is a question
noverb:  whether justice will be done
noverb:  Ha
active:  cried I
active:  it is anything
noverb:  in the nature of a problem
noverb:  you desire
active:  to see solved
active:  I should strongly recommend you
active:  to come to my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  you go to the official police
noverb:  Oh
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  fellow
active:  answered my visitor
active:  and I should be very glad
active:  he would take the matter up
noverb:  of course I must use the official police as well
noverb:  Would you give me an introduction to him
active:  I'll do better
noverb:  I'll take you round to him myself
passive: I should be immensely obliged to
noverb:  you
active:  We'll call a cab
active:  go together
active:  We shall just be in time
active:  to have a little breakfast with him
active:  Do you feel equal to it
noverb:  Yes
active:  I shall not feel easy
active:  I have told my story
active:  my servant will call a cab
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in an instant
active:  I rushed upstairs
active:  explained the matter shortly to my wife
active:  in five minutes was inside a hansom
noverb:  driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes was
noverb:  as I expected
noverb:  lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown
active:  reading the agony column of The Times
active:  smoking his before-breakfast pipe
passive: was composed
novoice: of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before
noverb:  all carefully dried
novoice: collected on the corner of the mantelpiece
active:  He received us in his quietly genial fashion
active:  ordered fresh rashers
noverb:  eggs
active:  joined us in a hearty meal
passive: When it was concluded
active:  he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa
active:  placed a pillow beneath his head
active:  laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
active:  It is easy
active:  to see
noverb:  your experience has been no common one
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said he
active:  Pray
active:  lie down there
active:  make yourself absolutely at home
active:  Tell us
active:  you can
noverb:  stop
passive: you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
active:  Thank you
active:  said my patient
active:  I have felt another man
active:  the doctor bandaged me
active:  I think
active:  your breakfast has completed the cure
active:  I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible
active:  I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
active:  Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
active:  veiled his keen and eager nature
active:  I sat opposite to him
active:  we listened in silence to the strange story
active:  our visitor detailed to us
active:  You must know
active:  said he
active:  I am an orphan and a bachelor
active:  residing alone in lodgings in London
noverb:  By profession
active:  I am a hydraulic engineer
active:  I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years
passive: I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich
noverb:  Two years ago
active:  having served my time
active:  having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death
active:  I determined
active:  to start in business for myself
active:  took professional chambers in Victoria Street
active:  I suppose
active:  everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
active:  To me it has been exceptionally
active:  During two years I have had three consultations
noverb:  one small job
active:  is absolutely all
active:  my profession has brought me
active:  My gross takings amount to $27 10s
noverb:  Every day
noverb:  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon
active:  I waited in my little den
noverb:  until at last my heart began
active:  to sink
active:  I came to believe
active:  I should never have any practice at all
noverb:  Yesterday,
noverb:  however
noverb:  just
active:  I was thinking
active:  leaving the office
novoice: my clerk entered
active:  to say
active:  there was a gentleman
active:  waiting
active:  wished to see me upon business
active:  He brought up a card
noverb:  too
noverb:  with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Close at his heels came the colonel himself
noverb:  a man rather over the middle size
noverb:  of an exceeding thinness
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  thin a man
noverb:  His whole face sharpened away into nose
noverb:  chin
active:  the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
active:  Yet this emaciation seemed
noverb:  to be his natural habit
noverb:  due to no disease
active:  for his eye was bright
noverb:  his step brisk
noverb:  his bearing assured
active:  He was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed
noverb:  his age
active:  I should judge
active:  would be nearer forty
noverb:  thirty
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  with something of a German accent
passive: You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,
active:  being a man
noverb:  who is not only proficient
noverb:  in his profession
active:  is also discreet and capable
active:  preserving a secret
active:  I bowed
noverb:  feeling
active:  any young man would at such an address
active:  May I ask
active:  it was
active:  gave me
noverb:  good a character
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it is better
noverb:  that I should not tell you
noverb:  just at this moment
active:  I have it from the same source
active:  you are
noverb:  an orphan
noverb:  a bachelor
active:  are residing alone in London
active:  That is quite correct
active:  I answered
active:  you will excuse me
active:  I say
active:  I cannot see
noverb:  all this bears upon my professional qualifications
active:  I understand
active:  it was on a professional matter
active:  you wished
active:  to speak to me
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  you will find
noverb:  all I say
active:  is really to the point
active:  I have a professional commission for you
active:  absolute secrecy is quite essential
noverb:  absolute secrecy
active:  you understand
noverb:  of course we may expect
noverb:  from a man
active:  is alone
noverb:  from one
noverb:  lives in the bosom of his family
active:  I promise to keep a secret
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you may absolutely depend upon my doing
active:  He looked very hard at me as I spoke
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  I had never seen so suspicious
active:  questioning an eye
noverb:  Do you promise
active:  said
noverb:  he at last
noverb:  Yes
active:  I promise
noverb:  Absolute
noverb:  complete silence before
noverb:  during
noverb:  after
noverb:  No reference to the matter at all
noverb:  in word or writing
noverb:  I have already given you my word
noverb:  Very good
active:  He suddenly sprang up
noverb:  darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door
noverb:  The passage
active:  was empty
active:  That's all right
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  coming back
active:  I know
active:  clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs
active:  Now we can talk in safety
active:  He drew up his chair very close
noverb:  to mine
active:  began
active:  to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
noverb:  A feeling of repulsion
noverb:  of something akin
active:  to fear
active:  had begun
active:  to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
noverb:  Even my dread
active:  losing a client
active:  could not restrain me
active:  showing my impatience
active:  I beg
active:  you will state your business, sir,
active:  said I
active:  my time is of value
active:  Heaven forgive me for that last sentence
active:  the words came to my lips
noverb:  would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you
active:  he asked
noverb:  Most admirably
active:  I say a night's work
noverb:  an hour's would be nearer the mark
active:  I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine
active:  has got out of gear
active:  you show us
active:  is wrong
active:  we shall soon set
active:  it right ourselves
noverb:  do you think of such a commission as that
active:  The work appears to be light
noverb:  the pay munificent
noverb:  Precisely
active:  We shall want you
active:  to come to-night by the last train
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  To Eyford
noverb:  in Berkshire
active:  It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire
noverb:  within seven miles of Reading
active:  There is a train
noverb:  from Paddington
noverb:  would bring you there at about 11
noverb:  15
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall come down in a carriage
active:  to meet you
active:  There is a drive
noverb:  Yes
active:  our little place is quite out in the country
noverb:  It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
active:  we can hardly get there
noverb:  midnight
active:  I suppose
active:  there would be no chance of a train back
passive: I should be compelled
active:  to stop the night
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  we could easily give you a shake-down
active:  That is very awkward
active:  Could I not come at some more convenient hour
active:  We have judged it best
active:  you should come late
active:  It is to recompense you for any inconvenience
active:  we are paying to
noverb:  you
noverb:  a young and unknown man
noverb:  a fee
active:  would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  you would like
active:  to draw out of the business
active:  there is plenty of time
active:  to do
active:  I thought of the fifty guineas
noverb:  of
noverb:  very useful they would be to me
noverb:  Not at all
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I shall be very happy
active:  to accommodate myself to your wishes
active:  I should like
noverb:  however
active:  to understand a little more clearly
active:  it is
active:  you wish me
active:  to do
noverb:  Quite
active:  It is very natural
noverb:  that the pledge of secrecy
active:  we have exacted from
active:  you should have aroused your curiosity
active:  I have no wish
active:  to commit you to anything without your having it all laid
noverb:  you
active:  I suppose
active:  we are absolutely safe
noverb:  from eavesdroppers
noverb:  Entirely
noverb:  the matter stands
active:  You are probably aware
noverb:  that fuller's-earth is a valuable product
passive: it is only found in one or two places in England
active:  I have heard
noverb:  Some little time ago
active:  I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading
active:  I was fortunate enough
active:  to discover
active:  there was a deposit
noverb:  of fuller's-earth in one of my fields
active:  examining it
noverb:  however
active:  I found
active:  this deposit was a comparatively small one
noverb:  it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
noverb:  left
noverb:  of them
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the grounds of my neighbours
active:  These good people were absolutely ignorant
active:  their land contained
active:  was quite
noverb:  a gold-mine
noverb:  Naturally,
active:  it was to my interest
active:  to buy their land
active:  they discovered its true value
active:  unfortunately I had no capital by
active:  I could do this
active:  I took a few of my friends into the secret
noverb:  however
active:  they suggested
active:  we should quietly
noverb:  secretly work our own little deposit
noverb:  in this way
active:  we should earn the money
active:  would enable us
active:  to buy the neighbouring fields
noverb:  This
active:  we have
active:  now been doing for some time
noverb:  in order
active:  to help us in our operations
active:  we erected a hydraulic press
noverb:  This press
active:  I have already explained
active:  has got out of order
active:  we wish your advice upon the subject
active:  We guard our secret very jealously
noverb:  however
active:  it once became known
active:  we had hydraulic engineers
active:  coming to our little house
active:  it would soon rouse inquiry
active:  the facts came out
active:  it would be good-bye
noverb:  to any chance
active:  getting these fields
active:  carrying out our plans
active:  That is
active:  I have made
active:  you promise me
active:  you will not tell a human being
active:  you are going to Eyford to-night
active:  I hope
active:  I make it all plain
noverb:  I quite follow you
active:  said I. 'The only point
active:  I could not quite understand
active:  was
active:  use
active:  you could make of a hydraulic press
active:  excavating fuller's-earth
active:  I understand
passive: is dug out
noverb:  gravel from a pit
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he carelessly
active:  we have our own process
active:  We compress the earth into bricks
active:  to remove them
active:  revealing
active:  they are
active:  is a mere detail
active:  I have taken you fully into my confidence now
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  I have shown you
active:  I trust you
active:  He rose as
active:  he spoke
active:  I shall expect you
noverb:  at Eyford at 11
noverb:  15
active:  I shall certainly be there
noverb:  And not a word to a soul
active:  He looked at me with a last long
noverb:  questioning gaze
active:  pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp
active:  he hurried from the room
noverb:  Well,
active:  I came to think it all over in cool blood
active:  I was very much astonished
noverb:  as you may
noverb:  think
noverb:  at this sudden commission
passive: had been intrusted to me
noverb:  On the one hand, of course,
active:  I was glad
noverb:  , for the fee was at least tenfold
active:  I should have asked
passive: had
active:  I set a price upon my own services
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that this order might lead to other ones
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me
active:  I could not think
noverb:  his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient
active:  to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight
noverb:  his extreme anxiety
active:  I should tell anyone of my errand
noverb:  However,
active:  I threw all fears to the winds
active:  ate a hearty supper
active:  drove to Paddington
novoice: started off
active:  having obeyed to the letter the injunction as
active:  to holding my tongue
active:  At Reading I had to change not only my carriage
noverb:  my station
noverb:  However,
active:  I was in time for the last train to Eyford
active:  I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock
active:  I was the only passenger
noverb:  who got out there
active:  there was no one
noverb:  upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
novoice: As I passed out through the wicket gate
noverb:  however
active:  I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
active:  Without a word he grasped my arm
active:  hurried me into a carriage
noverb:  the door of
active:  was standing open
active:  He drew up the windows on
noverb:  side
passive: tapped on the wood-work
noverb:  away we went
active:  the horse could go
noverb:  One horse
active:  interjected Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only one
active:  Did you observe the colour
noverb:  Yes
active:  I saw it by the side-lights
active:  I was stepping into the carriage
active:  It was a chestnut
noverb:  Tired-looking
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  glossy
active:  Thank you
active:  I am sorry
active:  to have interrupted you
active:  Pray
active:  continue your most interesting statement
noverb:  Away we went
active:  we drove for at least an hour
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark had said
active:  it was only seven miles
active:  I should think
noverb:  from the rate
active:  we seemed to go
noverb:  from the time
active:  we took
active:  it must have been nearer twelve
active:  He sat at my side in silence all the time
active:  I was aware
noverb:  , more than once
active:  I glanced in his direction
active:  he was looking at me with great intensity
active:  The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world
noverb:  for we lurched and jolted terribly
active:  I tried
active:  to look out of the windows
active:  to see something of
active:  we were
passive: they were made of frosted glass
noverb:  I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
noverb:  Now
active:  I hazarded some remark
active:  to break the monotony of the journey
novoice: the colonel answered only in monosyllables
active:  the conversation soon flagged
noverb:  At last
noverb:  however
passive: the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
active:  the carriage came to a stand
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out
active:  I followed after him
active:  pulled me swiftly into a porch
active:  gaped in front of us
active:  We stepped
active:  it were
noverb:  right out of the carriage
noverb:  into the hall
active:  I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
noverb:  The instant
active:  I had crossed the threshold
novoice: the door slammed heavily behind us
active:  I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels
active:  the carriage drove away
active:  It was pitch dark inside the house
novoice: the colonel fumbled
active:  looking for matches
active:  muttering under his breath
active:  Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage
active:  a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction
active:  It grew broader
novoice: a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand
active:  she held above her head
active:  pushing her face forward
active:  peering at us
active:  I could see
active:  she was pretty
noverb:  ,
noverb:  from the gloss with
active:  the light shone upon her dark dress I knew
active:  it was a rich material
active:  She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
active:  asking a question
novoice: my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable
active:  she gave such a start
active:  the lamp nearly fell from her hand
active:  Colonel Stark went up to her
noverb:  whispered something in her ear
active:  pushing her back into the room from whence she had come
active:  he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
active:  Perhaps you will have the kindness
active:  to wait in this room for a few minutes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  throwing open another door
active:  It was a quiet
noverb:  little
noverb:  plainly furnished room
noverb:  with a round table in the centre
noverb:  on
passive: several German books were scattered
active:  Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door
noverb:  I shall not keep you waiting an instant
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: vanished into the darkness
active:  I glanced at the books upon the table
active:  in spite of my ignorance of German I could see
active:  two of them were treatises
noverb:  on science
active:  the others being volumes of poetry
novoice: Then I walked across to the window
active:  hoping
active:  I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
noverb:  an oak shutter
noverb:  heavily barred
active:  was folded across
noverb:  it
active:  It was a
noverb:  wonderfully silent house
active:  There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage
active:  everything was deadly still
active:  A vague feeling of uneasiness began
active:  to steal over me
active:  were these German people
active:  were they doing living in this strange
noverb:  out-of-the-way place
active:  And where was the place
active:  I was ten miles
noverb:  from Eyford
active:  that was all I knew
noverb:  north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west I had no idea
noverb:  For
noverb:  matter
noverb:  Reading
noverb:  possibly other large towns
active:  were within that radius
active:  the place might not be so secluded
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Yet
active:  it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
noverb:  that we were in the country
active:  I paced up and down the room
active:  humming a tune under my breath
active:  to keep up my spirits
noverb:  feeling
active:  I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness
active:  the door of my room swung slowly open
active:  The woman was standing in the aperture
noverb:  the darkness of the hall behind her
noverb:  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face
active:  I could see at a glance
active:  she was sick
noverb:  with fear
active:  the sight sent a chill to my own heart
active:  She held up one shaking finger
active:  to warn me
active:  to be silent
active:  she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me
active:  her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her
active:  I would go
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  trying hard
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  to speak calmly
active:  I would go
active:  I should not stay here
active:  There is no good for you
active:  to do
noverb:  madam
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I have not yet done
active:  I came for
active:  I cannot possibly leave
active:  I have seen the machine
active:  It is not worth
noverb:  your
active:  to wait
active:  she went on
active:  You can pass through the door
active:  no one hinders
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  I smiled and shook my head
active:  she suddenly threw aside her constraint
active:  made a step forward
noverb:  , with her hands wrung together
noverb:  For the love of Heaven
active:  she whispered
active:  get away from here
active:  it is too late
active:  I am somewhat headstrong
noverb:  by nature
noverb:  the
active:  ready to engage in an affair
active:  there is some obstacle
noverb:  in the way
active:  I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,
noverb:  of the unpleasant night
active:  seemed to be
noverb:  me
active:  Was it all
active:  to go for nothing
active:  should I slink away
active:  having carried out my commission
noverb:  without the payment
active:  was my due
active:  This woman might
noverb:  for all I knew
active:  be a monomaniac
noverb:  With a stout bearing
noverb:  therefore
active:  her manner had shaken me more than
active:  I cared to confess
noverb:  I still shook my head
active:  declared my intention
active:  remaining
active:  I was
active:  She was about
active:  to renew her entreaties
active:  a door slammed overhead
passive: the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
active:  She listened for an instant
active:  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture
noverb:  vanished as suddenly
active:  she had come
active:  The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark
noverb:  a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin
passive: was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson
active:  This is my secretary
noverb:  manager
active:  said
noverb:  the colonel
noverb:  By the way
active:  I was under the impression
active:  I left this door shut just now
active:  I fear
active:  you have felt the draught
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  I opened the door myself
active:  I felt the room
active:  to be a little close
active:  He shot one of his suspicious looks at me
noverb:  Perhaps we
active:  had better
active:  proceed to business
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Mr. Ferguson
active:  I will take you up
active:  to see the machine
noverb:  I had better put my hat on
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
active:  it is in the house
active:  you dig fuller's-earth in the house
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  This is only
active:  we compress it
active:  never mind that
noverb:  All we wish you
active:  to do
active:  is to examine the machine
noverb:  to let us know
active:  is wrong with it
active:  We went upstairs together
noverb:  the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him
active:  It was a labyrinth of an old house
noverb:  , with corridors
noverb:  passages
active:  narrow winding staircases
noverb:  little low doors
noverb:  the thresholds of
passive: were hollowed out by the generations
active:  had crossed them
active:  There were no carpets
noverb:  no signs of any furniture above the ground floor
active:  the plaster was peeling off the walls
active:  the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches
active:  I tried
active:  to put on as unconcerned an air as possible
active:  I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady
active:  I disregarded them
active:  I kept a keen eye upon my two companions
active:  Ferguson appeared
active:  to be a morose and silent man
active:  I could see from the little
active:  he said
active:  he was at least a
noverb:  fellow-countryman
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last
noverb:  a low door
active:  he unlocked
active:  was a small
noverb:  square room
noverb:  in
active:  the three of us could hardly get at one time
active:  Ferguson remained
active:  the colonel ushered me in
active:  We are now
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  actually within the hydraulic press
active:  it would be a
noverb:  particularly unpleasant thing for us
active:  anyone were to turn it on
active:  The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston
active:  it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
active:  There are small lateral columns of water
active:  receive the force
active:  transmit and multiply it in the manner
active:  is familiar to you
active:  The machine goes readily enough
active:  there is some stiffness
noverb:  in the working of it
active:  it has lost a little of its force
active:  Perhaps you will have the goodness
active:  to look it
active:  show us
noverb:  we can set it right
active:  I took the lamp from him
active:  I examined the machine very thoroughly
noverb:  It was indeed a gigantic one
noverb:  capable
active:  exercising enormous pressure

active:  followed my remarks very carefully
active:  asked several practical questions as to
noverb:  they should proceed to set it right
active:  When I had made it clear to them
noverb:  , I returned to the main chamber of the machine
active:  took a good look at it
active:  to satisfy my own curiosity
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  at a glance
noverb:  the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication
active:  for it would be absurd
active:  to suppose
noverb:  powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
active:  The walls were of wood
novoice: the floor consisted of a large iron trough
active:  I came to examine it
active:  I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
active:  I had stooped and was scraping at this
active:  to see exactly
active:  it was
active:  I heard a muttered exclamation in German
active:  saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
active:  are you doing there
active:  he asked

noverb:  The instant

noverb:  His face set hard

noverb:  Very well

active:  slammed the little door
active:  turned the key in the lock
active:  I rushed towards
noverb:  it
novoice: pulled at the handle
active:  it was quite secure
noverb:  ,
active:  did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves
noverb:  Hullo
active:  I yelled
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Colonel
active:  Let me out
noverb:  And then suddenly in the silence
active:  I heard a sound
active:  sent my heart into my mouth
active:  It was the clank of the levers and the swish
noverb:  of the leaking cylinder
active:  He had set the engine at work
active:  The lamp still stood upon the floor
active:  I had placed it
active:  examining the trough
active:  By its light I saw
active:  the black ceiling was coming down upon me
noverb:  slowly
noverb:  jerkily
active:  none knew better
noverb:  myself
noverb:  with a force
active:  must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
active:  I threw myself

novoice: dragged with my nails at the lock

active:  to let me out
active:  the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries
active:  The ceiling was only a foot
noverb:  two above my head
passive: with my hand upraised
active:  I could feel its hard
noverb:  rough surface
active:  it flashed through my mind
active:  the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in
active:  I met it
active:  If I lay on my face the weight
active:  would come upon my spine
active:  I shuddered
active:  to think of
noverb:  dreadful snap
noverb:  Easier the other way
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  and
noverb:  had I the nerve
active:  to lie and look up at
noverb:  deadly black shadow wavering down upon me
active:  Already I was unable
active:  to stand erect
novoice: my eye caught something
active:  brought a gush of hope back to my heart
active:  I have said
noverb:  the floor
active:  ceiling were of iron
active:  the walls were of wood
active:  As I gave a last
active:  hurried glance around
active:  I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards
active:  broadened and broadened
passive: a small panel was pushed backward
active:  For an instant I could hardly believe
active:  here was indeed a door
active:  led away from death
noverb:  The next instant
active:  I threw myself through
noverb:  lay half-fainting upon the other side
active:  The panel had closed again behind me
noverb:  the crash of the lamp
noverb:  a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal
active:  told me
noverb:  narrow had been my escape
passive: I was recalled
active:  to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist
active:  I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor

novoice: tugged at me with her left hand
active:  she held a candle in her right
active:  It was the same good friend
noverb:  warning I had
noverb:  foolishly rejected

active:  she cried breathlessly
active:  They will be here
noverb:  in a moment
active:  They will see
active:  you are not there
noverb:  Oh
active:  do not waste the so-precious time
active:  come
noverb:  This time
noverb:  at least
noverb:  I did not scorn her advice
active:  I staggered to my feet
active:  ran with her along the corridor
noverb:  down a winding stair
active:  The latter led to another broad passage
noverb:  just
active:  we reached it
active:  we heard the sound of running feet
noverb:  the shouting of two voices
active:  one answering the other from the floor on
active:  we were
noverb:  from the one beneath
noverb:  My guide stopped and looked about her
noverb:  one
active:  is at her wit's end
noverb:  she threw open a door
active:  led into a bedroom
noverb:  through the window of

noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  It is high
active:  it may be
active:  you can jump it
active:  she spoke a light
active:  sprang into view at the further end of the passage
active:  I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon
noverb:  a butcher's cleaver in the other
active:  I rushed across the bedroom
noverb:  flung open the window
novoice: looked out
noverb:  quiet and sweet
noverb:  wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight
active:  it could not be more than thirty feet down
active:  I clambered out upon the sill

active:  pursued me
active:  she were ill-used
noverb:  ,
noverb:  at any risks
passive: I was determined
active:  to go back to her assistance
active:  The thought had hardly flashed through my mind

active:  pushing his way past her
active:  she threw her arms
active:  round him
active:  tried
noverb:  to hold him back
noverb:  Fritz
noverb:  Fritz
active:  she cried in English
active:  remember your promise after the last time
active:  You said
active:  it should not be again
active:  He will be silent
noverb:  Oh
active:  he will be silent
active:  You are mad
noverb:  , Elise
active:  he shouted
noverb:  struggling
active:  to break away from her
active:  You will be the ruin of us
active:  He has seen too much
noverb:  Let me pass
active:  I say
active:  He dashed her to one side
noverb:  rushing to the window
noverb:  cut at me with his heavy weapon
noverb:  I had let myself go
active:  was hanging by the hands to the sill
noverb:  his blow fell
active:  I was conscious
noverb:  of a dull pain
noverb:  my grip loosened

noverb:  however
active:  I ran
noverb:  a deadly dizziness

noverb:  for the first time
noverb:  saw
passive: my thumb had been cut off
active:  the blood was pouring from my wound
active:  I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it
active:  there came a sudden
active:  buzzing in my ears
noverb:  next moment
active:  I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
noverb:  long I remained unconscious
active:  I cannot tell
active:  It must have been a very long time
active:  for the moon had sunk
active:  a bright morning was breaking
active:  I came to myself
active:  My clothes were all sodden with dew
noverb:  my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
active:  The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure
active:  I sprang to my feet with the feeling
active:  I might hardly
active:  be safe from my pursuers
noverb:  to my astonishment
active:  I came
active:  to look
active:  round me
noverb:  neither house

active:  to be the very station at

active:  Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand
noverb:  all
active:  had passed
active:  during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
noverb:  Half dazed
active:  I went into the station
novoice: asked about the morning train
active:  There would be one
noverb:  to Reading in less than an hour
active:  The same porter was on duty
active:  I found
active:  had been there
active:  I arrived
active:  I inquired of him
active:  he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark
active:  The name was strange to him
noverb:  Had he observed a carriage the night
noverb:  waiting for me
noverb:  No
active:  he had not
noverb:  Was there a police-station anywhere near
active:  There was one
noverb:  about three miles off
active:  It was too far for me
active:  to go
noverb:  weak and ill
active:  I was
active:  I determined
active:  to wait
active:  I got back to town
active:  telling my story to the police
noverb:  It was a little past six

active:  I went first
noverb:  to have my wound dressed
active:  the doctor was kind enough
active:  to bring me along here
active:  I put the case into your hands
active:  shall do exactly
active:  you advise
noverb:  We
noverb:  sat in silence for some little time
active:  listening to this extraordinary narrative
novoice: Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in
active:  he placed his cuttings
active:  Here is an advertisement
active:  will interest you
active:  said he
active:  It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
active:  Listen to this

noverb:  etc
noverb:  Ha
active:  That represents the last time
active:  the colonel needed to have his machine
novoice: overhauled
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  cried my patient
active:  explains
active:  the girl said
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  It is quite clear
noverb:  that the colonel was a cool and desperate man
active:  was absolutely determined
active:  nothing should stand in the way of his little game
noverb:  like those out-and-out pirates
active:  will leave no survivor from a captured ship
noverb:  Well,
active:  every moment now is precious
active:  you feel equal to it
active:  we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary
active:  to starting for Eyford
noverb:  Some three hours
noverb:  afterwards
active:  we were all
noverb:  in the train together
noverb:  bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village

noverb:  myself
active:  Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat
active:  was busy with his compasses
active:  drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
noverb:  There
active:  you are
active:  said he
passive: That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
noverb:  The place we want must be somewhere near
noverb:  line
active:  You said ten miles
active:  I think
noverb:  sir
active:  It was an hour's good drive
noverb:  And you think
active:  they brought
active:  you back all
noverb:  way
active:  you were unconscious
active:  They must have done
active:  I have a confused memory
noverb:  too
passive: having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
active:  I cannot understand
active:  said I
active:  is
active:  they should have spared you
active:  they found
active:  you lying
active:  fainting in the garden
passive: Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties
active:  I hardly think
noverb:  likely
active:  I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
noverb:  Oh
active:  we shall soon clear up all that
active:  said Bradstreet
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have drawn my circle
active:  I only wish
active:  I knew at
noverb:  point upon it the folk
active:  we are in search
active:  are to be found
active:  I think
active:  I could lay my finger on it
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  now
active:  cried the inspector
active:  you have formed your opinion
active:  Come
noverb:  now
active:  we shall see
active:  agrees with
noverb:  you
active:  I say
active:  it is south
noverb:  , for the country is more deserted there
active:  And I say east
active:  said my patient
active:  I am for west
active:  remarked the plain-clothes man
noverb:  There are several quiet little villages up there
active:  And I am for north
active:  said I
active:  there are no hills
noverb:  there
active:  our friend says
active:  he did not notice the carriage
active:  go up any
active:  Come
active:  cried the inspector
noverb:  laughing
active:  it's a very pretty diversity of opinion
active:  We have boxed the compass among us
active:  do you give your casting vote to
active:  You are all
active:  wrong
noverb:  we can't all be
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  you can
active:  This is my point
active:  He placed his finger in the centre of the circle
active:  This is
active:  we shall find them
noverb:  the twelve-mile drive
active:  gasped Hatherley
noverb:  Six out
noverb:  six back
noverb:  Nothing simpler
active:  You say yourself
active:  the horse was fresh and glossy
active:  you got in
active:  could it be
active:  it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it is a likely ruse enough
active:  observed Bradstreet thoughtfully
noverb:  Of course
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  as to the nature of this gang
noverb:  None at all
active:  said Holmes
active:  They are coiners
noverb:  on a large scale
active:  have used the machine
active:  to form the amalgam
active:  has taken the place of silver
active:  We have known for some time
active:  a clever gang was at work
active:  said the inspector
active:  They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
active:  We even traced them
noverb:  Reading
active:  could get no farther
noverb:  for they had covered their traces in a way
active:  showed
active:  they were very old hands
noverb:  now
noverb:  thanks to this lucky chance
active:  I think
active:  we have got them right enough
passive: the inspector was mistaken
passive: for those criminals were not destined
active:  to fall into the hands of justice
noverb:  As we rolled into Eyford Station
active:  we saw a gigantic column of smoke
active:  streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood
noverb:  hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
noverb:  A house on fire
active:  asked Bradstreet
active:  the train steamed off again on its way
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  said the station-master
active:  When did it break out
active:  I hear
active:  it was during the night
noverb:  sir
active:  it has got worse
active:  the whole place is in a blaze
active:  house is it
noverb:  Dr. Becher's
active:  Tell me
active:  broke in the engineer
noverb:  is Dr. Becher a German
noverb:  very thin
noverb:  with a long, sharp nose
active:  The station-master laughed heartily
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  Dr. Becher is an Englishman
noverb:  there isn't a man in the parish
active:  has a better-lined waistcoat
active:  he has a gentleman
active:  staying with him
noverb:  a patient
active:  I understand
noverb:  who is a foreigner
active:  he looks as
noverb:  a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
active:  The station-master had not finished his speech
active:  we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
active:  The road topped a low hill
active:  there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us
noverb:  spouting fire at every chink
noverb:  window
noverb:  in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
active:  That's it
active:  cried Hatherley
noverb:  in intense excitement
active:  There is the gravel-drive
active:  there are the rose-bushes
active:  I lay
active:  second window is the one
active:  I jumped from
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  at least
active:  said Holmes
active:  you have had your revenge upon them
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  that it was your oil-lamp
active:  it was crushed
noverb:  in the press
noverb:  set fire to the wooden walls
noverb:  no doubt
active:  they were too excited
noverb:  in the chase after you
active:  to observe it at the time
noverb:  Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night
noverb:  I very much fear
noverb:  they are a good hundred miles off by now
active:  And Holmes' fears came to be realised
noverb:  for from that day to this no word has
passive: ever been heard
noverb:  of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman
noverb:  Early
noverb:  morning a peasant had met a cart
active:  containing several people
noverb:  some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading
noverb:  there all traces of the fugitives disappeared
novoice: even Holmes' ingenuity failed
active:  to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
active:  The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
active:  they had found within
noverb:  still
active:  discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
noverb:  About sunset
noverb:  however
active:  their efforts were at last successful
active:  they subdued the flames
noverb:  not
active:  the roof had fallen in
passive: the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin
noverb:  save some twisted cylinders
noverb:  iron piping
novoice: not a trace remained of the machinery
active:  had cost our unfortunate acquaintance
noverb:  dearly
noverb:  Large masses of nickel
passive: of tin were discovered
novoice: stored in an out-house
active:  no coins were to be found
active:  may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes
passive: have been already referred to
passive: our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot
active:  he recovered his senses
active:  might have remained forever a mystery
active:  were it not for the soft mould
noverb:  told us a very plain tale
passive: He had evidently been carried down by two persons
noverb:  one of
active:  had remarkably small feet
noverb:  the other unusually large ones
noverb:  On the whole
active:  it was most
noverb:  probable
noverb:  the silent Englishman
active:  being less bold
noverb:  less murderous
noverb:  his companion
active:  had assisted the woman
active:  to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
noverb:  Well
active:  said our engineer ruefully
active:  we took our seats
active:  to return once
noverb:  to London
active:  it has been a pretty business for me
active:  I have lost my thumb
active:  I have lost a fifty-guinea fee
active:  have I gained
noverb:  Experience
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  Indirectly it may be of value

active:  to put it into words
active:  to gain the reputation
active:  being excellent company for the remainder of your existence

active:  Fresh scandals have eclipsed it
active:  their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama
active:  As I have reason
active:  to believe
noverb:  however
passive: the full facts have never been revealed to the general public
active:  my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share
active:  clearing the matter up
active:  I feel
active:  no memoir of him would be complete
noverb:  without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
active:  It was a few weeks
noverb:  my own marriage
noverb:  during the days
active:  I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street
active:  he came home from an afternoon stroll

active:  I had brought back in one of my limbs
active:  a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
noverb:  With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another
active:  I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
passive: saturated with the news of the day
noverb:  I tossed them all aside
active:  lay listless
noverb:  watching the huge crest
noverb:  monogram upon the envelope upon the table
active:  wondering lazily
active:  my friend's noble correspondent could be
active:  Here is a very fashionable epistle
active:  I remarked
active:  he entered
noverb:  Your morning letters
active:  I remember right
active:  were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
noverb:  Yes
active:  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety
active:  he answered
noverb:  smiling
active:  and the humbler are usually the more interesting
active:  This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses
noverb:  call upon a man
passive: to be bored
active:  to lie
active:  He broke the seal

noverb:  Oh

noverb:  One of the highest in England
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  I congratulate you
active:  I assure you
noverb:  Watson, without affectation,
active:  the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
noverb:  the interest of his case
active:  It is just possible
noverb:  , however
active:  also may not be wanting in this new investigation
active:  You have been reading the papers diligently of late
active:  have you not
active:  It looks like
noverb:  it
active:  said I ruefully
active:  pointing to a huge bundle in the corner
active:  I have had nothing else
active:  to do
active:  It is fortunate
noverb:  , for you will perhaps be able
active:  to post me up
active:  I read nothing
noverb:  the criminal news and the agony column
active:  The latter is always instructive

noverb:  yes
noverb:  with the deepest interest
active:  That is well
noverb:  The letter

noverb:  therefore
active:  to call upon
noverb:  you
active:  to consult you in reference to the very painful event
active:  has occurred in connection with my wedding
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter
active:  he assures me
active:  he sees no objection to your co-operation
noverb:  he even thinks
active:  it might be of some assistance
active:  I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon
active:  should you have any other engagement at
noverb:  time
active:  I hope
active:  you will postpone it
active:  this matter is of paramount importance
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  ST. SIMON
passive: It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions
active:  written with a quill pen

noverb:  very instructive in all this
active:  I think
active:  I must turn to
noverb:  you Watson
noverb:  for something more solid
active:  I have very little difficulty
active:  finding
active:  I want
active:  said I
active:  for the facts are quite recent
active:  the matter struck me as remarkable
active:  I feared to refer them to you
noverb:  however
active:  I knew
active:  you had an inquiry on hand
active:  you disliked the intrusion of other matters
noverb:  Oh
active:  you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van
active:  That is quite cleared up now
noverb:  indeed
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  Pray
noverb:  give me the results of your newspaper selections
active:  Here is the first notice
active:  I can find
active:  It is in the personal column of the Morning Post
noverb:  dates
noverb:  as you see
active:  some weeks back
passive: A marriage has been arranged
active:  it says
active:  will
active:  rumour is correct
noverb:  very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral
noverb:  Miss Hatty Doran
noverb:  the only daughter of Aloysius Doran
noverb:  Esq.
noverb:  of San Francisco
noverb:  Cal.
noverb:  U.S.A.
active:  is all
noverb:  Terse
noverb:  to the point
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  stretching his long
active:  thin legs towards the fire
active:  There was a paragraph
active:  amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  here it is
active:  There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market
active:  for the present free-trade principle appears
active:  to tell heavily against our home product
noverb:  One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic
passive: An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
passive: have been borne away by these charming invaders
noverb:  Lord St. Simon

noverb:  Miss Doran
noverb:  graceful figure

noverb:  with expectancies for the future
active:  it is an open secret
passive: the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled
active:  to sell his pictures within the last few years
active:  Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance
active:  will enable her
active:  to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress
noverb:  Anything else
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  plenty
active:  there is another note
noverb:  in the Morning Post
active:  to say
active:  the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one
active:  it would be at St. George's
noverb:  Hanover Square
noverb:  only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited
active:  the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate
passive: has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--
active:  there is a curt announcement
noverb:  that the wedding had taken place
passive: the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place
noverb:  near Petersfield
noverb:  Those are all the notices
active:  appeared
noverb:  the disappearance of the bride
noverb:  the
active:  asked Holmes with a start
noverb:  The vanishing of the lady
active:  When did she vanish
noverb:  At the wedding breakfast
noverb:  Indeed
active:  This is more interesting
novoice: it promised
active:  to be
noverb:  quite dramatic
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  it struck me
active:  being a little out of the common
active:  They often vanish
noverb:  the ceremony
noverb:  occasionally during the honeymoon
active:  I cannot call
active:  to mind anything quite
noverb:  prompt as this
active:  Pray
noverb:  let me have the details
active:  I warn you
active:  they are very incomplete
active:  Perhaps we may make them
noverb:  Such as they are
passive: they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday
active:  I will read to
noverb:  you
passive: It is headed
noverb:  Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
passive: The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes
active:  have taken place in connection with his wedding
noverb:  The ceremony
noverb:  as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday
active:  occurred on the previous morning
active:  it is only now
active:  it has been possible
active:  to confirm the strange rumours
active:  have been
active:  persistently floating about
noverb:  In spite of the attempts of the friends
active:  to hush the matter up
noverb:  much public attention has
passive: now been drawn to it
passive: no good purpose can be served
active:  affecting
active:  to disregard
active:  is a common subject for conversation
noverb:  The ceremony
passive: was performed at St. George's
noverb:  Hanover Square
noverb:  was a very quiet one
noverb:  no one being present save the father of the bride
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother
noverb:  sister of the bridegroom)
noverb:  Lady Alicia Whittington
active:  The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate,
passive: breakfast had been prepared
active:  It appears
passive: some little trouble was caused by a woman
passive: name has not been ascertained
active:  endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party
active:  alleging
active:  she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon
active:  It was only after a painful
noverb:  prolonged scene
passive: she was ejected by the butler and the footman
noverb:  The bride
active:  had fortunately entered the house
noverb:  this unpleasant interruption
active:  had sat down
active:  to breakfast with the rest
active:  she complained of a sudden indisposition
novoice: retired to her room
noverb:  Her prolonged absence having caused some comment
active:  her father followed her
passive: learned from her maid
active:  she had only come up to her chamber for an instant
novoice: caught up an ulster
noverb:  bonnet
novoice: hurried down to the passage
active:  One of the footmen declared
noverb:  he had seen a lady leave the house
novoice: apparelled
active:  had refused
active:  to credit
active:  it was his mistress
noverb:  , believing her
active:  to be with the company
active:  ascertaining
active:  his daughter had disappeared
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  in conjunction with the bridegroom
novoice: put themselves in communication with the police
passive: very energetic inquiries are being made
active:  will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
noverb:  Up to a late hour last night
noverb:  however
active:  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady
active:  There are rumours
noverb:  of foul play in the matter
active:  it is said
active:  the police have caused the arrest of the woman
active:  had caused the original disturbance
noverb:  in the belief
passive: from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
active:  And is
noverb:  all
noverb:  Only one little item in another of the morning papers
active:  it is a suggestive one
active:  And it is
noverb:  That Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  the lady
active:  had caused the disturbance
passive: has actually been arrested
active:  It appears
active:  she was formerly a danseuse
noverb:  at the Allegro
active:  she has known the bridegroom for some years
active:  There are no further particulars
active:  the whole case is in your hands now
passive: it has been set forth in the public press
noverb:  And an exceedingly interesting case it appears
active:  to be
active:  I would not have missed it for worlds
active:  there is a ring
noverb:  at the bell, Watson,
active:  as the clock makes it a few minutes after four
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this will prove to be our noble client
active:  Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer
active:  having a witness
noverb:  only as a check to my own memory
noverb:  Lord Robert St. Simon
active:  announced our page-boy
noverb:  throwing open the door
active:  A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale
noverb:  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
noverb:  with the steady, well-opened eye of a man
noverb:  pleasant lot
active:  it had ever been
active:  to command
passive: to be obeyed
active:  His manner was brisk
active:  his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
noverb:  for he had a slight forward stoop
noverb:  a little bend of the knees
active:  he walked
noverb:  His hair
noverb:  too
noverb:  as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat
active:  was grizzled round the edges
noverb:  thin upon the top
noverb:  As to his dress
active:  it was careful
noverb:  to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat
noverb:  white waistcoat
noverb:  yellow gloves
noverb:  patent-leather shoes
noverb:  light-coloured gaiters
active:  He advanced slowly into the room
active:  turning his head from left to right
noverb:  swinging in his right hand the cord
active:  held his golden eyeglasses
noverb:  Good-day
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said Holmes, rising and bowing
noverb:  Pray take the basket-chair
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  Draw up a little to the fire
active:  we will talk this matter over
noverb:  A most painful matter to me
noverb:  as you can most readily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: I have been cut to the quick
active:  I understand
active:  you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
active:  I presume
active:  they were hardly from the same class of society
noverb:  No
active:  I am descending
active:  I beg pardon
active:  My last client of the sort was a king
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  really
active:  I had no idea
noverb:  And
noverb:  king
noverb:  The King of Scandinavia
passive: Had
active:  he lost his wife
active:  You can understand
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
active:  I promise to
noverb:  you in yours
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  Very right! very right
noverb:  I'm sure I beg pardon
noverb:  As to my own case
active:  I am ready
noverb:  to give you any information
active:  may assist you
active:  forming an opinion
active:  Thank you
active:  I have already learned all
active:  is in the public prints
noverb:  nothing
active:  I presume
active:  I may take it as correct
noverb:  this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride
novoice: Lord St. Simon glanced over
noverb:  it
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is correct
noverb:  ,
active:  it goes
active:  it needs a great deal
active:  supplementing
active:  anyone could offer an opinion
active:  I think
active:  I may arrive at my facts most directly
active:  questioning you
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
noverb:  In San Francisco
noverb:  a year ago
active:  You were travelling in the States
noverb:  Yes
active:  Did you become engaged
noverb:  No
active:  you were on a friendly footing
passive: I was amused by her society
active:  she could see
passive: I was amused
active:  Her father is very rich
passive: He is said
active:  to be the richest man on the Pacific slope
noverb:  And
active:  did he make his money
noverb:  In mining
active:  He had nothing a few years ago
noverb:  he struck gold
active:  invested it
active:  came up by leaps and bounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  is your own impression as to the young lady's
noverb:  your wife's character
active:  The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster
novoice: stared down into the fire
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  my wife was twenty
active:  her father became a rich man
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  she ran free in a mining camp
active:  wandered through woods
noverb:  mountains
active:  her education has come from Nature rather
noverb:  from the schoolmaster
active:  She is
active:  we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild
noverb:  free
noverb:  unfettered by any sort of traditions
active:  She is impetuous
noverb:  --volcanic
active:  I was about
active:  to say
active:  She is swift
noverb:  in making up her mind
noverb:  fearless
active:  carrying out her resolutions
noverb:  On the other hand
noverb:  I would not have given her the name
active:  I have the honour
active:  to bear
noverb:  --he gave a little stately cough--
active:  had I not thought her
active:  to be at bottom a noble woman
active:  I believe
active:  she is capable
noverb:  of heroic self-sacrifice
noverb:  anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
active:  Have you her photograph
active:  I brought this with me
active:  He opened a locket
noverb:  showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
active:  It was not a photograph
noverb:  but an ivory miniature
active:  the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair
noverb:  the large dark eyes
noverb:  the exquisite mouth
active:  Holmes gazed long
noverb:  earnestly at it
active:  he closed the locket
active:  handed it back to Lord St. Simon
active:  The young lady came to London
active:  you renewed your acquaintance
noverb:  Yes
active:  her father brought her over for this last London season
active:  I met her several times
active:  became engaged to her
active:  have
active:  now married her
active:  She brought
active:  I understand
noverb:  a considerable dowry
noverb:  A fair dowry
active:  Not more than is usual in my family
noverb:  And this
noverb:  of course
noverb:  remains to you
active:  the marriage is a fait accompli
active:  I really have made no inquiries on the subject
noverb:  Very naturally not
active:  Did you see Miss Doran on the day
noverb:  the wedding
noverb:  Yes
active:  Was she in good spirits
noverb:  Never better
active:  She kept talking of
active:  we should do in our future lives
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is very interesting
noverb:  And on the morning of the wedding
active:  She was
noverb:  possible
noverb:  at least until after the ceremony
active:  And did you observe any change in her
noverb:  Well,
active:  to tell the truth
active:  I saw
noverb:  the first signs
active:  I had
noverb:  seen
active:  her temper was just a little sharp
noverb:  The incident however
active:  was too trivial
active:  to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
active:  Pray
noverb:  let us have it
noverb:  for all that
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is childish
active:  She dropped her bouquet
active:  we went towards the vestry
active:  She was passing the front pew at the time
noverb:  it fell over into the pew
active:  There was a moment's delay
active:  the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again
active:  it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
active:  Yet when I spoke to her of the matter
active:  she answered me abruptly
noverb:  and in the carriage
noverb:  on our way home
active:  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
noverb:  Indeed
active:  You say
active:  there was a gentleman
noverb:  in the pew
active:  Some of the general public were present
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  It is impossible
active:  to exclude them
active:  the church is open
active:  This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  I call him a gentleman by courtesy
active:  he was quite a common-looking person
active:  I hardly noticed his appearance
active:  really I think
active:  we are wandering rather far from the point
noverb:  Lady St. Simon
novoice: returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind
active:  she had gone to
noverb:  it
active:  did
noverb:  she do on re-entering her father's house
active:  I saw her in conversation with her maid
noverb:  And
noverb:  is her maid
noverb:  Alice is her name
active:  She is an American
active:  came from California with her
noverb:  A confidential servant
noverb:  A little too much
active:  It seemed to me
active:  her mistress allowed her
active:  to take great liberties
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  in America they look upon these things in a different way
noverb:  long did she speak to this Alice
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  a few minutes
active:  I had something else
active:  to think of
active:  You did not overhear
active:  they said
active:  Lady St. Simon said
noverb:  something about 'jumping a claim
passive: She was accustomed
active:  to use slang of the kind
active:  I have no idea
active:  she meant
active:  American slang is very expressive sometimes
noverb:  And
active:  did your wife
active:  do
active:  she finished speaking to her maid
active:  She walked into the breakfast-room
noverb:  On your arm
noverb:  No
noverb:  alone
active:  She was very independent
noverb:  in little matters
noverb:  that
noverb:  after we had sat down for ten minutes
active:  she rose hurriedly
active:  muttered some words of apology
active:  left the room
active:  She never came back
noverb:  this maid, Alice
active:  I understand
active:  deposes
active:  she went to her room
active:  covered her bride's dress with a long ulster
noverb:  put on a bonnet
active:  went out
noverb:  Quite
active:  And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
noverb:  a woman
active:  is now in custody
noverb:  had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
noverb:  your relations to her
active:  Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders
active:  raised his eyebrows
active:  We have been on a friendly footing for some years
active:  I may say on a very friendly footing
active:  She used
active:  to be at the Allegro
active:  I have not treated her ungenerously
active:  she had no just cause of complaint against me
active:  you know
active:  women are
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Flora was a dear little thing
noverb:  exceedingly hot-headed
novoice: devotedly attached to me
noverb:  She wrote me dreadful letters
active:  she heard
active:  I was about
passive: to be married
active:  to tell the truth
noverb:  the reason
noverb:  I had the marriage celebrated
active:  quietly was
active:  I feared
active:  there might be a scandal
noverb:  in the church
active:  She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we
active:  returned
active:  she endeavoured to push her way in
active:  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife
active:  even threatening her
active:  I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort
noverb:  I had two police fellows there in private clothes
active:  soon pushed her out again
active:  She was quiet
noverb:  when she saw
active:  there was no good
active:  making a row
active:  Did your wife hear all this
noverb:  No
active:  thank goodness
active:  she did not
active:  And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
noverb:  Yes
active:  That is
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious
active:  It is thought
active:  Flora decoyed my wife out
active:  laid some terrible trap for her
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a possible supposition
active:  You think
noverb:  too
active:  I did not say a probable one
noverb:  you do not yourself look upon this as likely
active:  I do not think Flora
active:  would hurt a fly
noverb:  Still,
active:  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters
active:  Pray
active:  is your own theory as to
active:  took place
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I came to seek a theory
noverb:  not
active:  to propound one
noverb:  I have given you all the facts
active:  you ask me
noverb:  however
active:  I may say
active:  it has occurred to me as possible
noverb:  the excitement of this affair
noverb:  the consciousness
active:  she had made so immense a social stride
active:  had the effect
active:  causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
noverb:  In short
active:  she had become suddenly deranged
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I consider
active:  she has turned her back
active:  I will not say upon me
noverb:  upon
noverb:  much
noverb:  many have aspired to without success
active:  I can hardly explain it in any other fashion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  certainly
active:  is also a conceivable hypothesis
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I think
active:  I have nearly all my data
active:  May I ask
passive: you were seated at the breakfast-table
active:  you could see out of the window
active:  We could see the other side of the road and the Park
noverb:  Quite
active:  Then I do not think
active:  I need to detain you longer
active:  I shall communicate with
noverb:  you
passive: Should
active:  you be fortunate enough
active:  to solve this problem
active:  said our client, rising
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Eh
active:  was that
active:  I say
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Where
active:  is my wife
active:  That is a detail
active:  I shall speedily supply
active:  Lord St. Simon shook his head
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it will take wiser heads
noverb:  yours
noverb:  mine
active:  he remarked
noverb:  bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner
active:  he departed
active:  It is very good
noverb:  of Lord St. Simon
active:  to honour my head
active:  putting it on a level with his own
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I think
active:  I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning
active:  I had formed my conclusions as to the case
active:  our client came into the room
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  I have notes of several similar cases
noverb:  none
active:  I remarked before
active:  were quite as prompt
active:  My whole examination served
active:  to turn my conjecture into a certainty
active:  Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing
noverb:  as
active:  you find a trout in the milk
active:  to quote Thoreau's example
active:  I have heard all
active:  you have heard
noverb:  Without
noverb:  however
noverb:  the knowledge of pre-existing cases
active:  serves me
noverb:  well
noverb:  There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back
noverb:  something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War
active:  It is one of these cases
noverb:  hullo
active:  here is Lestrade
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard
active:  there are cigars
noverb:  in the box
passive: The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket
noverb:  cravat
active:  gave him a decidedly nautical appearance
active:  he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
active:  With a short greeting he seated himself
active:  lit the cigar
passive: had been offered to him
active:  What's up
active:  asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye
active:  You look dissatisfied
active:  And I feel dissatisfied
active:  It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case
active:  I can make
noverb:  head
noverb:  tail of the business
noverb:  Really
active:  You surprise me
novoice: ever heard of such a mixed affair
active:  Every clue seems
active:  to slip through my fingers
active:  I have been at work upon it all day
noverb:  And very wet it seems to have made you
noverb:  said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have been dragging the Serpentine
noverb:  In heaven's name
noverb:  for
noverb:  In search of the body of Lady St. Simon
active:  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair
novoice: laughed heartily
active:  Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain
active:  he asked
noverb:  do you mean
active:  you have just as good a chance
active:  finding this lady in the one as in the other
active:  Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion
active:  I suppose
active:  you know all about it
active:  he snarled
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have only just heard the facts
passive: my mind is made up
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  you think
noverb:  the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
active:  I think it very unlikely
noverb:  perhaps you will kindly explain
active:  it is
active:  we found this in it
active:  He opened his bag as he spoke
active:  tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk
noverb:  a pair of white satin shoes
noverb:  a bride's wreath
noverb:  veil
noverb:  all discoloured and soaked in water
noverb:  There
active:  said he
active:  putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile
active:  There is a little nut for you
active:  to crack
noverb:  Master Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  said
noverb:  my friend
noverb:  blowing blue rings into the air
active:  You dragged them from the Serpentine
noverb:  No
noverb:  They
passive: were found
active:  floating near the margin by a park-keeper
passive: They have been identified as her clothes
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  the clothes were there
active:  the body would not be far off
noverb:  By the same brilliant reasoning
active:  every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe
active:  And pray
active:  did you hope
active:  to arrive at through this
active:  At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that you will find it difficult
active:  Are you
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  now
active:  cried Lestrade with some bitterness
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , Holmes
active:  you are not very practical
noverb:  with your deductions and your inferences
active:  You have made two blunders in as many minutes
active:  This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  And
active:  In the dress is a pocket
active:  In the pocket is a card-case
active:  In the card-case is a note
active:  And here is the very note
active:  He slapped it down upon the table in front of him
active:  Listen to this
active:  You will see me
noverb:  all is ready
active:  Come at once
noverb:  F. H. M.' Now my theory all
active:  has been
passive: Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar
noverb:  she, with confederates, no doubt
active:  was responsible for her disappearance
noverb:  Here,
passive: signed with her initials
active:  is the very note
passive: was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door
active:  lured her within their reach
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  You really are very fine indeed
noverb:  Let me see it
active:  He took up the paper in a listless way
noverb:  his attention
active:  became
novoice: riveted
active:  he gave a little cry of satisfaction
active:  This is indeed important
active:  said he
noverb:  Ha! you find it
noverb:  Extremely
active:  I congratulate you warmly
active:  Lestrade rose in his triumph
active:  bent his head
active:  to look
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  you
active:  looking at the wrong side
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  this is the right side
noverb:  The right side
noverb:  You're mad
noverb:  Here is the note written in pencil over here
active:  And over here is
active:  appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill
active:  interests me deeply
active:  There's nothing in it
active:  I looked at it before
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  Oct. 4th
noverb:  rooms 8s
noverb:  breakfast 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  cocktail 1s
noverb:  lunch 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  glass sherry
noverb:  8d
active:  I see nothing in that
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  It is most
noverb:  important
noverb:  all the same
noverb:  As to the note
active:  it is important also
noverb:  ,
active:  at least the initials are
active:  I congratulate you again
noverb:  I've wasted time enough
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  rising
active:  I believe in hard work
noverb:  not
active:  sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
noverb:  Good-day, Mr. Holmes
active:  we shall see
active:  gets to the bottom of the matter first
active:  He gathered up the garments
novoice: thrust them into the bag
novoice: made for the door
noverb:  Just one hint to you, Lestrade
active:  drawled Holmes
noverb:  his rival vanished
noverb:  I will tell you the true solution of the matter
active:  Lady St. Simon is a myth
active:  There is not
active:  there never has been
noverb:  any such person
active:  Lestrade looked sadly at my companion
active:  he turned to me
noverb:  tapped his forehead three times
active:  shook his head solemnly
noverb:  hurried away
active:  He had hardly shut the door behind him
active:  Holmes rose
active:  to put on his overcoat
active:  There is something
noverb:  in
active:  the fellow says about outdoor work
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  I must leave you to your papers for a little
active:  It was after five o'clock
active:  Sherlock Holmes left me
novoice: I had no time
active:  to be lonely
noverb:  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box
noverb:  This
active:  he unpacked with the help of a youth
active:  he had brought with him
active:  presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began
passive: to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany
active:  There were a couple
noverb:  of brace of cold woodcock
noverb:  a pheasant
noverb:  a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles
active:  Having laid out all these luxuries
active:  my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save
passive: the things had been paid for
passive: were ordered to this address
noverb:  Just
noverb:  nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room
passive: His features were gravely set
active:  there was a light in his eye
active:  made me think
passive: he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
active:  They have laid the supper
active:  he said
active:  rubbing his hands
active:  You seem to expect company
active:  They have laid for five
noverb:  Yes
active:  I fancy
active:  we may have some company
active:  dropping in
active:  said he
active:  I am surprised
active:  Lord St. Simon has not already arrived
noverb:  Ha
active:  I fancy
active:  I hear his step now upon the stairs
active:  It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon
active:  came bustling in
active:  dangling his glasses more vigorously
noverb:  with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
active:  My messenger reached you
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I confess
active:  the contents startled me beyond measure
noverb:  Have you good authority for
active:  you say
noverb:  The best possible
active:  Lord St. Simon sank into a chair
active:  passed his hand over his forehead
active:  will the Duke
active:  say
active:  he murmured
active:  when he hears
passive: one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
active:  It is the purest accident
active:  I cannot allow
active:  there is any humiliation
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  you look on these things from another standpoint
active:  I fail
active:  to see
active:  anyone is
active:  to blame
active:  I can hardly see
active:  the lady could have acted
noverb:  her abrupt method
active:  doing
active:  it was undoubtedly
passive: to be regretted
active:  Having no mother
active:  she had no one
active:  to advise her at such a crisis
active:  It was a slight
noverb:  sir
noverb:  a public slight
active:  said Lord St. Simon
active:  tapping his fingers upon the table
active:  You must make allowance for this poor girl
noverb:  placed in so unprecedented a position
active:  I will make no allowance
active:  I am very angry indeed
noverb:  ,
passive: I have been shamefully used
active:  I think
active:  I heard a ring
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Yes
novoice: there are steps on the landing
active:  If I cannot persuade you
active:  to take a lenient view of the matter
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I have brought an advocate here
active:  may be more successful
active:  He opened the door
active:  ushered in a lady and gentleman
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said he
active:  allow me
active:  to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton
noverb:  The lady
active:  I think
active:  you have already met
active:  At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat
active:  stood very erect
novoice: with his eyes cast down
passive: his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat
noverb:  a picture of offended dignity
active:  The lady had taken a quick step forward
active:  had held out her hand to him
novoice: he still refused
active:  to raise his eyes
active:  It was as well for his resolution
noverb:  perhaps
active:  for her pleading face was one
active:  it was hard
active:  to resist
noverb:  You're angry
noverb:  Robert
active:  said she
noverb:  Well,
active:  I guess
active:  you have every cause
active:  to be
noverb:  Pray make no apology to me
active:  said Lord St. Simon bitterly
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I know
active:  I have treated you real bad
active:  I should have spoken to
noverb:  you
active:  I went
active:  I was kind
noverb:  of rattled
noverb:  from the time
active:  I saw Frank here again I just didn't know
active:  I was doing or saying
active:  I only wonder I didn't fall down
noverb:  do a faint right there
noverb:  the altar
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mrs. Moulton
active:  you would like my friend
noverb:  me
active:  to leave the room
active:  you explain this matter
active:  I may give an opinion
active:  remarked the strange gentleman
noverb:  we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already
noverb:  For my part
active:  I should like all Europe and America
active:  to hear the rights of it
active:  He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face
noverb:  alert manner
active:  I'll tell our story right away
active:  said the lady
noverb:  Frank here
active:  I met in '84
noverb:  in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies,
active:  Pa was working a claim
passive: We were engaged to each other
noverb:  Frank
noverb:  I
active:  one day father struck a rich pocket
active:  made a pile
active:  poor Frank here had a claim
active:  petered out
active:  came to nothing
active:  The richer Pa grew
active:  the poorer was Frank
noverb:  at last Pa wouldn't hear
active:  of our engagement lasting any longer
active:  he took me away to 'Frisco
noverb:  Frank wouldn't throw up his hand
noverb:  though
noverb:  he followed me there
active:  he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it
active:  It would only have made him mad
active:  to know
active:  we just fixed it all up for ourselves
active:  Frank said
active:  he would go and make his pile
noverb:  too
noverb:  never come back
active:  to claim me
active:  he had
noverb:  Pa
active:  I promised
active:  to wait for him to the end of time
active:  pledged myself not
active:  to marry anyone else
active:  he lived
noverb:  shouldn't we be married right away
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I will feel sure of you
noverb:  and I won't claim
active:  to be your husband
active:  I come back
noverb:  Well,
active:  we talked it over
active:  he had fixed it all up
noverb:  nicely
noverb:  with a clergyman all ready in waiting
noverb:  we just did it right there
active:  and then Frank went off
active:  to seek his fortune
active:  I went back to Pa
noverb:  The next
active:  I heard of Frank was
active:  he was in Montana
active:  he went
active:  prospecting in Arizona
active:  I heard of him from New Mexico
noverb:  After
active:  came a long newspaper story about
passive: a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians
active:  there was my Frank's name
noverb:  among the killed
active:  I fainted dead away
active:  I was very sick
noverb:  for months after
active:  Pa thought
active:  I had a decline
active:  took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco
active:  Not a word of news came for a year
active:  I never doubted
active:  Frank was really dead
active:  Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco
active:  we came to London
passive: a marriage was arranged
active:  Pa was very pleased
active:  I felt all the time
active:  no man on this earth would
noverb:  take the place in my heart
passive: had been given to my poor Frank
noverb:  Still,
active:  I had married Lord St. Simon
noverb:  of course I'd have done my duty by him
noverb:  We can't command our love
active:  we can our actions
active:  I went to the altar with him with the intention
active:  to make him just as good a wife
active:  it was in me
active:  to be
active:  you may imagine
active:  I felt
noverb:  just
active:  I came to the altar rails
active:  I glanced back
active:  saw Frank standing
active:  looking at me out of the first pew
active:  I thought
active:  it was his ghost
noverb:  at first
active:  I looked again there
active:  he was still
noverb:  , with a kind of question in his eyes
noverb:  as
active:  to ask me
active:  I were glad or sorry
active:  to see him
active:  I wonder I didn't drop
active:  I know
active:  everything was turning round
active:  the words of the clergyman were just
noverb:  the buzz of a bee in my ear
noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  Should I stop the service
active:  make a scene in the church
active:  I glanced at him again
active:  he seemed to know
active:  I was thinking
noverb:  for he raised his finger to his lips
active:  to tell me
active:  to be still
noverb:  Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was writing me a note
active:  As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him
active:  he slipped the note into my hand
noverb:  he returned me the flowers
active:  It was only a line
active:  asking me
active:  to join him
active:  he made the sign to me
active:  to do
noverb:  Of course I never doubted for a moment
active:  my first duty was now to him
active:  I determined to do just
active:  he might direct
active:  When I got back
active:  I told my maid
active:  had known him in California
active:  had always been his friend
active:  I ordered her
active:  to say nothing
active:  to get a few things
novoice: packed
noverb:  my ulster ready
active:  I know
active:  I ought
active:  to have spoken to Lord St. Simon
active:  it was dreadful
noverb:  hard
noverb:  his mother and all those great people
active:  I just made up my mind
active:  to run away
active:  explain afterwards
noverb:  I hadn't been at the table ten minutes
active:  I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road
active:  He beckoned to me
active:  began walking into the Park
active:  I slipped out
noverb:  put on my things
active:  followed him
active:  Some woman came talking something
noverb:  other about Lord St. Simon to me
novoice: seemed to me from the little
active:  I heard as
active:  he had a little secret of his own
noverb:  marriage also
active:  I managed
active:  to get away from her
active:  soon overtook Frank
active:  We got into a cab together
noverb:  away we drove to some lodgings
active:  he had taken in Gordon Square
noverb:  was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
active:  Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches
active:  had escaped
active:  came on to 'Frisco
active:  found
active:  I had given him up for dead
active:  had gone to England
noverb:  followed me there
active:  had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
active:  I saw it in a paper
active:  explained the American
active:  It gave the name
noverb:  the church
noverb:  not
active:  the lady lived
active:  we had a talk as to
active:  we should do
active:  Frank was all for openness
active:  I was so ashamed
noverb:  of it all
active:  I felt as
active:  I should like to vanish away
active:  never see any of them again
noverb:  just sending a line to Pa
noverb:  perhaps
active:  to show him
active:  I was alive
active:  It was awful
noverb:  to me
active:  to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round
noverb:  breakfast-table and waiting for me
active:  to come back
active:  So Frank took my wedding-clothes
noverb:  things
active:  made a bundle of them
passive: I should not be traced
active:  dropped them away somewhere
active:  no one could find them
active:  It is likely
active:  we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow
noverb:  only
active:  this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening
active:  he found
active:  us is more than
active:  I can think
active:  he showed us very clearly
noverb:  kindly
active:  I was wrong
noverb:  and
active:  Frank was right
active:  we should be putting ourselves in the wrong
active:  we were so secret
noverb:  he offered to give us a chance
active:  talking to Lord St. Simon alone
active:  we came right away round to his rooms at once
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Robert
active:  you have heard it all
active:  I am very sorry
noverb:  if I have given you pain
active:  I hope
active:  you do not think very meanly of me
active:  Lord St. Simon had
active:  by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
active:  had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
active:  Excuse me
active:  he said
active:  it is not my custom
active:  to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
noverb:  you won't forgive me
noverb:  You won't shake hands
active:  I go
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  it would give you any pleasure
active:  He put out his hand
novoice: coldly grasped
active:  she extended to him
active:  I had hoped
active:  suggested Holmes
active:  you would have joined us in a friendly supper
active:  I think
noverb:  there
active:  you ask a little too much
active:  responded his Lordship
passive: I may be forced
active:  to acquiesce in these recent developments
passive: I can hardly be expected
active:  to make merry over them
active:  I think
noverb:  with your permission
active:  I will
active:  now wish you all a very good-night
active:  He included us all in a sweeping bow
novoice: stalked out of the room
active:  I trust
active:  you at least will honour me with your company
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is always a joy
active:  to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for
active:  I am one of those
active:  believe
active:  the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
active:  being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
active:  shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
active:  The case has been an interesting one
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  our visitors had left us
noverb:  it serves
active:  to show very clearly
noverb:  simple the explanation may be of an affair
active:  at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable
active:  Nothing could be more natural
noverb:  the sequence of events
passive: narrated by this lady
noverb:  nothing stranger
noverb:  than the result
novoice: viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard
active:  You were not yourself at fault at all
noverb:  From the first
active:  two facts were very obvious to me
noverb:  the one
active:  the lady had been quite willing
active:  to undergo the wedding ceremony
noverb:  the other
active:  she had repented of
noverb:  it within a few minutes of returning home
active:  Obviously something had occurred during the morning
active:  to cause her
noverb:  to change her mind
active:  could that something be
active:  She could not have spoken to anyone
active:  she was out
noverb:  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
noverb:  Had she seen someone
active:  she had
active:  it must be someone
noverb:  from America
active:  she had spent
noverb:  short a time in this country
active:  she could hardly have allowed anyone
active:  to acquire
noverb:  deep an influence over her
active:  the mere sight of him would induce her
active:  to change her plans
noverb:  completely
active:  You see
active:  we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea
active:  she might have seen an American
active:  could
novoice: this American be
active:  should he possess
noverb:  much influence over her
active:  It might be a lover
active:  it might be a husband
noverb:  Her young womanhood had
active:  I knew
passive: been spent in rough scenes
noverb:  under strange conditions
active:  So far I had got
active:  I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative
active:  When he told us of a man in a pew
noverb:  of the change in the bride's manner
noverb:  of so transparent a device
active:  obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet
noverb:  of her resort to her confidential maid
noverb:  of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping
noverb:  in miners' parlance means taking possession of
active:  another person has a prior claim to
active:  the whole situation became absolutely clear
active:  She had gone off with a man
active:  the man was
noverb:  a lover
active:  was a previous husband
novoice: the chances being in favour of the latter
noverb:  And
noverb:  in the world did you find them
active:  It might have been difficult
noverb:  friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of
noverb:  he did not himself know
active:  The initials were, of course, of the highest importance
noverb:  more valuable still was it
active:  to know
noverb:  within a week
active:  he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels
active:  did you deduce the select
noverb:  By the select prices
active:  Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels
active:  There are not many
noverb:  in London
active:  charge at
noverb:  rate
noverb:  In the second one
active:  I visited in Northumberland Avenue
active:  I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton
noverb:  an American gentleman
active:  had left only the day before
active:  looking over the entries against him
active:  I came upon the very items
active:  I had seen in the duplicate bill
active:  His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square
active:  thither I travelled
novoice: being fortunate enough
active:  to find the loving couple at home
noverb:  I ventured to give them some paternal advice
active:  to point out to them
active:  it would be better
noverb:  in every way
noverb:  they should make their position a little clearer
noverb:  both to the general public
noverb:  to Lord St. Simon in particular
active:  I invited them
noverb:  to meet him here
noverb:  as you see
noverb:  I made him keep the appointment
noverb:  with no very good result
active:  I remarked
active:  His conduct was certainly not very gracious
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  perhaps you would not be very gracious
active:  , after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife
noverb:  of fortune
active:  I think
active:  we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
active:  thank our stars
active:  we are never likely
active:  to find ourselves in the same position
noverb:  Draw your chair up
noverb:  hand me my violin
active:  for the only problem we have still
active:  to solve
active:  is
noverb:  to
noverb:  away these bleak autumnal evenings
noverb:  XI
noverb:  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
noverb:  Holmes
active:  said I
active:  I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street
active:  here is a madman coming along
active:  It seems rather sad
active:  his relatives should allow him
active:  to come out alone
noverb:  My friend rose lazily from his armchair
novoice: stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown
noverb:  looking over my shoulder
active:  It was a bright, crisp February morning
noverb:  the snow of the day
noverb:  still lay deep upon the ground
noverb:  shimmering brightly in the wintry sun
passive: Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic
noverb:  at
noverb:  side
noverb:  on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay
active:  it fell
passive: The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped
active:  was still dangerously slippery
active:  there were fewer passengers
noverb:  usual
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
active:  eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
active:  He was a man
noverb:  of about fifty, tall, portly
noverb:  imposing
noverb:  with a massive
active:  strongly marked face and a commanding figure
passive: He was dressed in a sombre
noverb:  rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters
noverb:  well-cut pearl-grey trousers
active:  Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
noverb:  features
noverb:  for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
passive: is little accustomed
active:  to set any tax upon his legs
active:  he ran
active:  he jerked his hands up and down
active:  waggled his head
active:  writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
active:  on earth can be the matter with him
active:  I asked
active:  He is looking up at the numbers of the houses
active:  I believe
active:  he is coming here
active:  said Holmes
active:  rubbing his hands
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
active:  I rather think
active:  he is coming to consult me professionally
active:  I think
active:  I recognise the symptoms
noverb:  Ha! did I not tell you
noverb:  As he spoke
noverb:  the man
noverb:  puffing
noverb:  blowing
noverb:  rushed at our door
novoice: pulled
novoice: at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
noverb:  A few moments later he was in our room
noverb:  still puffing
noverb:  still gesticulating
noverb:  with
active:  fixed a look of grief
noverb:  despair in his eyes
active:  our smiles
passive: were turned in an instant to horror and pity
active:  For a while he could not get his words out
active:  swayed his body
novoice: plucked at his hair
noverb:  one
passive: has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason
active:  suddenly springing to his feet
active:  he beat his head against the wall with such force
noverb:  we
noverb:  rushed upon him
active:  tore him away to the centre of the room
active:  Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair
noverb:  sitting beside him
active:  patted his hand
novoice: chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones
active:  he knew
noverb:  well
active:  to employ
active:  You have come to me
active:  to tell your story
active:  have you not
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: You are fatigued with your haste
active:  Pray wait
active:  you have recovered yourself
active:  I shall be most happy
active:  to look into any little problem
active:  you may submit to me
noverb:  The man sat for a minute
noverb:  with a heaving chest
noverb:  fighting against his emotion
active:  he passed his handkerchief over his brow
noverb:  set his lips tight
active:  turned his face towards us
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you think me mad
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I see
active:  you have had some great trouble
active:  responded Holmes
active:  God knows
novoice: I have!
noverb:  a trouble
active:  is enough
active:  to unseat my reason
noverb:  sudden
noverb:  so terrible is it
noverb:  Public disgrace I might have faced
active:  I am a man
noverb:  whose character has never yet borne a stain
active:  Private affliction also is the lot of every man
active:  the two coming together
noverb:  in so frightful a form
active:  have been enough
active:  to shake my very soul
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is not I alone
active:  The very noblest in the land may suffer
passive: some way be found out of this horrible affair
active:  Pray
active:  compose yourself, sir
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  and let me have a clear account of
active:  you are
active:  it is
active:  has befallen you
noverb:  My name
active:  answered our visitor
active:  is probably familiar to your ears
active:  I am Alexander Holder
noverb:  ,
noverb:  of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson
noverb:  of Threadneedle Street
active:  The name was indeed well known to us
active:  belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London
active:  could have happened
active:  to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass
active:  We waited
noverb:  all curiosity
noverb:  until with another effort
active:  he braced himself
active:  to tell his story
active:  I feel
active:  time is of value
active:  said he
active:  that is
active:  I hastened here
active:  the police inspector suggested
active:  I should secure your co-operation
active:  I came to Baker Street by the Underground
active:  hurried from there on foot
active:  for the cabs go slowly through this snow
active:  That is
active:  I was
noverb:  out of breath
noverb:  for
active:  I am a man
noverb:  who takes very little exercise
active:  I feel better now
active:  I will put the facts
noverb:  you as shortly
noverb:  yet
active:  I can
active:  It is
noverb:  of course
active:  well known to
noverb:  you
noverb:  in a successful banking business
novoice: much depends upon our being able
active:  to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
noverb:  the number of our depositors
noverb:  One of our most lucrative means
active:  laying out
active:  money is in the shape of loans
active:  the security is unimpeachable
active:  We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years
active:  there are many noble families to
active:  we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures
noverb:  libraries
noverb:  plate
noverb:  Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank
passive: a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
active:  I started
active:  I saw the name
active:  for it was
noverb:  of none other than
noverb:  well
noverb:  perhaps even to you I had
active:  better say no more than
active:  it was a name
noverb:  which is a household word all over the earth
noverb:  one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England
passive: I was overwhelmed by the honour
noverb:  attempted
active:  he entered
active:  to say
active:  he plunged at once into business with the air of a man
active:  wishes
active:  to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: I have been informed
active:  you are in the habit of advancing money
active:  The firm does
active:  the security is good
active:  I answered
active:  It is absolutely essential
noverb:  to me
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I should have $50,000 at once
active:  I could, of course, borrow
noverb:  trifling a sum ten times over from my friends
noverb:  I much prefer to make it a matter of business
active:  to carry out
noverb:  business myself
noverb:  In my position
active:  you can readily understand
active:  it is unwise
active:  to place one's self under obligations
noverb:  For
noverb:  long
active:  may I ask
active:  do you want this sum
active:  I asked
active:  Next Monday I have a large sum due to me
active:  I shall
active:  most certainly repay
noverb:  you advance
noverb:  with
active:  interest
active:  you think it right
active:  to charge
active:  it is very essential
noverb:  to me
passive: the money should be paid at once
active:  I should be happy
active:  to advance it without further parley from my own private purse
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  were it not
active:  the strain would be rather more than
active:  it could bear
active:  , on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm
active:  in justice to my partner I must insist
noverb:  even in your case
passive: every businesslike precaution should be taken
noverb:  I should much prefer to have it
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  raising up a square, black morocco case
active:  he had laid beside his chair
active:  You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
noverb:  One of the most precious public possessions of the empire
active:  said I.
noverb:  Precisely
active:  He opened the case
noverb:  there
passive: imbedded in soft
noverb:  flesh-coloured velvet
noverb:  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
active:  he had named
active:  There are thirty-nine enormous beryls
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the price of the gold chasing
active:  is incalculable
active:  The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum
active:  I have asked
passive: I am prepared
active:  to leave it with you as my security
active:  I took the precious case into my hands
novoice: looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
active:  You doubt its value
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  I only doubt
noverb:  The propriety of my leaving it
active:  You may set your mind at rest about that
active:  I should not dream
active:  doing
active:  so were it not absolutely certain
noverb:  that I should be able
noverb:  in four days
active:  to reclaim it
active:  It is a pure matter of form
active:  Is the security sufficient
noverb:  Ample
active:  You understand
noverb:  Mr. Holder
noverb:  I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence
active:  I have in
noverb:  you
noverb:  founded upon all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you
active:  I rely upon
noverb:  you not only
active:  to be discreet
active:  to refrain from all gossip upon the matter
noverb:  above all
active:  to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution
active:  I need
active:  not say
passive: a great public scandal would be caused
active:  any harm were to befall it
active:  Any injury to it would be almost
noverb:  its complete loss
active:  for there are no beryls
noverb:  in the world
active:  to match these
active:  it would be impossible
active:  to replace them
active:  I leave it with you
noverb:  however, with every confidence,
active:  I shall call for
noverb:  it in person on Monday morning
active:  Seeing
active:  my client was anxious
active:  to leave
active:  I said no
active:  calling for my cashier
active:  I ordered him
active:  to pay over fifty $1000 notes
active:  When I was alone once
noverb:  however
noverb:  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me
active:  I could not
noverb:  think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
novoice: it entailed upon me
active:  There could be no doubt
noverb:  that
active:  it was a national possession
active:  a horrible scandal would ensue
active:  any misfortune should occur to
noverb:  it
noverb:  I
novoice: already regretted
active:  having ever consented to take charge of it
noverb:  However,
active:  it was too late
active:  to alter the matter now
active:  I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
noverb:  to my work
active:  When evening came
active:  I felt
active:  it would be an imprudence
active:  to leave
noverb:  precious a thing in the office behind me
passive: Bankers' safes had been forced
noverb:  now
active:  should not mine
active:  be
noverb:  terrible would be the position in
active:  I should find myself
active:  I determined
noverb:  therefore
noverb:  for the next few days
active:  I would always carry the case backward
noverb:  forward with me
active:  it might never be really out of my reach
noverb:  With this intention
active:  I called a cab
active:  drove out to my house at Streatham
active:  carrying the jewel with me
active:  I did not breathe freely
active:  I had taken it upstairs
active:  locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
noverb:  And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you
active:  to thoroughly understand the situation
noverb:  My groom
noverb:  my page sleep out of the house
passive: may be set aside altogether
active:  I have three maid-servants
active:  have been with me a number of years
active:  absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
noverb:  Another
noverb:  Lucy Parr
noverb:  the second waiting-maid
active:  has only been in my service a few months
active:  She came with an excellent character
noverb:  however
noverb:  has always given me satisfaction
active:  She is a very pretty girl
active:  has attracted admirers
active:  have occasionally hung about the place
active:  That is the only drawback
active:  we have found to her
active:  we believe her
active:  to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
noverb:  much for the servants
noverb:  My family
active:  itself is so small
noverb:  that it will not take me long
active:  to describe it
active:  I am a widower
active:  have an only son, Arthur
active:  He has been a disappointment to me
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  a grievous disappointment
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am myself
active:  to blame
active:  People tell me
active:  I have spoiled him
noverb:  Very likely I have
active:  When my dear wife died
active:  I felt
active:  he was all
active:  I had
active:  to love
active:  I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
noverb:  I have never denied him a wish
active:  Perhaps it would
active:  have been better for
novoice: of us had
novoice: I been sterner
active:  I meant it for the best
active:  It was naturally my intention
noverb:  that he should succeed me in my business
active:  he was not of a business turn
active:  He was wild
noverb:  wayward
active:  to speak the truth
active:  I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
noverb:  When
active:  he was young
active:  he became a member of an aristocratic club
noverb:  there
active:  having charming manners
active:  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
active:  He learned
active:  to play heavily at cards
active:  to squander money on the turf
active:  he had again
noverb:  again
active:  to come to me
active:  implore me
noverb:  to give him an advance upon his allowance
active:  he might settle his debts of honour
active:  He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company
active:  he was keeping
noverb:  each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough
active:  to draw him back again
noverb:  And,
noverb:  indeed
active:  I could not wonder
noverb:  such a man
active:  Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him
noverb:  for he has frequently brought him to my house
active:  I have found myself
active:  I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
active:  He is older
noverb:  than Arthur
noverb:  a man of the world to his finger-tips
noverb:  one
active:  had been everywhere
noverb:  seen everything
noverb:  a brilliant talker
noverb:  a man of great personal beauty
noverb:  Yet when I think of him in cold blood
noverb:  far away from the glamour of his presence
passive: I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look
active:  I have caught in his eyes
active:  he is one
noverb:  who should be deeply distrusted
active:  So I think
noverb:  too
active:  thinks my little Mary
active:  has a woman's quick insight into character
active:  And now there is only she
passive: to be described
active:  She is my niece
active:  my brother died five years ago
active:  left her alone in the world
active:  I adopted her
active:  have looked upon her
noverb:  as my daughter
active:  She is a sunbeam
noverb:  in my house
noverb:  sweet
noverb:  loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager
noverb:  housekeeper
noverb:  yet as tender
noverb:  quiet
noverb:  gentle as a woman could be
noverb:  She is my right hand
active:  I do not know
active:  I could do without her
active:  In only one matter has she
noverb:  gone against my wishes
active:  Twice my boy has asked her
active:  to marry him
noverb:  for he loves her devotedly
noverb:  each time
active:  she has refused him
active:  I think
active:  anyone could have drawn him into the right path
active:  it would have been she
active:  his marriage might have changed his whole life
noverb:  now
noverb:  alas!
active:  it is too late
noverb:  --forever too late
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you know the people
active:  live under my roof
active:  I shall continue with my miserable story
active:  When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
noverb:  night after dinner
active:  I told Arthur
noverb:  Mary my experience
noverb:  of the precious treasure
active:  we had under our roof
active:  suppressing only the name of my client
noverb:  Lucy Parr
active:  had brought in the coffee
active:  had
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , left the room
active:  I cannot swear
passive: the door was closed
noverb:  Mary
passive: Arthur were much interested and wished
active:  to see the famous coronet
active:  I thought it better not
active:  to disturb it
passive: Where have
active:  you put it
active:  asked Arthur
noverb:  In my own bureau
noverb:  Well,
active:  I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: It is locked up
active:  I answered
noverb:  Oh
active:  any old key will fit that bureau
active:  When I was a youngster
noverb:  I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
active:  He often had a wild way of talking
active:  I thought little of
active:  he said
active:  He followed me to my room
noverb:  however
noverb:  night with a very grave face
noverb:  Look here, dad
active:  said
active:  he with his eyes cast down
noverb:  can you let me have $200
noverb:  No
active:  I cannot
active:  I answered sharply
active:  I have been far too generous with you in money matters
active:  You have been very kind
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I must have this money
active:  else I can never show my face inside the club again
noverb:  And a very good thing
noverb:  too
active:  I cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not bear the disgrace
active:  I must raise the money in some way
noverb:  you will not let me have it
active:  I must try other means
active:  I was very angry
noverb:  , for this was the third demand during the month
active:  You shall not have a farthing from me
active:  I cried
noverb:  on
active:  he bowed and left the room without another word
passive: When he was gone
active:  I unlocked my bureau
noverb:  made sure
active:  my treasure was safe
active:  locked it again
active:  Then I started
active:  to go round the house
active:  to see
noverb:  all was secure
noverb:  a duty
active:  I usually leave to Mary
active:  I thought it well
noverb:  to perform myself that night
active:  As I came down the stairs
noverb:  I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall
active:  she closed and fastened
active:  I approached
noverb:  Tell me, dad,' said
noverb:  she
noverb:  looking
active:  I thought
noverb:  a little disturbed
active:  did you give Lucy
noverb:  the maid
noverb:  leave
active:  to go out to-night?
noverb:  Certainly not
active:  She came in just now by the back door
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she has only been to the side gate
active:  to see someone
active:  I think
active:  it is hardly safe
noverb:  and should be stopped
active:  You must speak to her in the morning
active:  I will
active:  you prefer it
active:  Are you sure
passive: everything is fastened
noverb:  Quite sure
noverb:  dad
noverb:  good-night
active:  I kissed her
active:  went up to my bedroom again
active:  I was soon asleep
noverb:  I am endeavouring to tell you everything
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  may have any bearing upon the case
active:  I beg
active:  you will question me upon any point
active:  I do not make clear
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  your statement is singularly lucid
active:  I come to a part of my story now in
active:  I should wish to be particularly
active:  I am not a very heavy sleeper
novoice: the anxiety in my mind tended
noverb:  no doubt
active:  to make me even
noverb:  usual
noverb:  About two in the morning
passive: I was awakened by some sound in the house
active:  It had ceased ere
novoice: I was wide
noverb:  awake
active:  it had left an impression behind it as
active:  a window had gently closed somewhere
active:  I lay listening with all my ears
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my horror
active:  there was a distinct sound of footsteps
active:  moving softly in the next room
active:  I slipped out of bed
noverb:  all palpitating with fear
active:  peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
noverb:  Arthur
active:  I screamed
noverb:  you villain! you thief
active:  dare
active:  you touch that coronet
active:  The gas was half up
active:  I had left it
noverb:  my unhappy boy
passive: dressed only in his shirt
noverb:  trousers
active:  was standing beside the light
noverb:  holding the coronet in his hands
active:  He appeared
active:  to be wrenching at
noverb:  it
active:  bending it with all his strength
active:  At my cry he dropped it from his grasp
active:  turned
noverb:  death
active:  I snatched it up
active:  examined it
noverb:  One of the gold corners
noverb:  with three of the beryls in it
active:  was missing
active:  You blackguard
active:  I shouted
noverb:  beside myself with rage
active:  You have destroyed it
noverb:  You have dishonoured me forever
active:  Where are the jewels
active:  you have stolen
noverb:  Stolen
active:  he cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  thief
active:  I roared
active:  shaking him by the shoulder
active:  There are none
active:  missing
active:  There cannot be any missing
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  There are three
noverb:  missing
active:  And you know
active:  they are
noverb:  Must I call you a liar
noverb:  a thief
active:  Did I not see
active:  you trying to tear off another piece
active:  You have called me names enough
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I will not stand it any longer
active:  I shall not say another word about this business
active:  you have chosen to insult me
active:  I will leave your house in the morning
noverb:  make my own way in the world
active:  You shall leave it in the hands of the police
active:  I cried half-mad with grief and rage
active:  I shall have this matter
novoice: probed to the bottom
active:  You shall learn nothing from me
active:  said
noverb:  he with a passion such as I should not have thought
active:  was in his nature
active:  you choose to call the police
active:  let the police
active:  find
active:  they can
active:  By this time the whole house was astir
noverb:  for I had raised my voice in my anger
active:  Mary was the first
active:  to rush into my room
noverb:  at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face
active:  she read the whole story
noverb:  , with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground
active:  I sent the house-maid for the police
active:  put the investigation into their hands at once
noverb:  When the inspector
active:  a constable entered the house, Arthur
novoice: had stood sullenly with his arms folded
active:  asked me
active:  it was my intention
active:  to charge him with theft
active:  I answered
active:  it had ceased to be a private matter
noverb:  had become a public one
active:  the ruined coronet was national property
active:  I was determined
active:  the law should have its way in everything
noverb:  At least,
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you will not have me arrested at once
active:  It would be to your advantage
noverb:  mine
active:  I might leave the house for five minutes
active:  you may get away
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you may conceal
active:  you have stolen
active:  said I. And
active:  realising the dreadful position in
passive: I was placed
active:  I implored him
active:  to remember
noverb:  not only my honour
noverb:  of one
noverb:  who was far greater
noverb:  than I was at stake
noverb:  and
active:  he threatened to raise a scandal
active:  would convulse the nation
active:  He might avert it all
active:  he would
active:  tell me
active:  he had done with the three missing stones
active:  You may as well face the matter
active:  said
noverb:  I
passive: you have been caught in the act
active:  no confession could make your guilt more heinous
noverb:  you
noverb:  make such reparation
active:  is in your power
active:  telling us
active:  the beryls are
noverb:  all shall be forgiven and forgotten
noverb:  Keep your forgiveness for those
active:  ask for it
active:  he answered
noverb:  turning away from me with a sneer
active:  I saw
active:  he was too hardened
noverb:  for any words of mine
active:  to influence him
active:  There was
noverb:  one way for it
active:  I called in the inspector
active:  gave him into custody
passive: A search was made at once not only of his person
noverb:  of his room
noverb:  of every portion of the house
active:  he could possibly have concealed the gems
passive: no trace of them could be found
noverb:  would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats
noverb:  This morning
passive: he was removed to a cell
noverb:  I
active:  going through all the police formalities
active:  have hurried round to you
active:  to implore you
active:  to use your skill
active:  unravelling the matter
active:  The police have openly confessed
active:  they can at present make nothing of it
active:  You may go to any expense
active:  you think necessary
active:  I have already offered a reward of $1000
noverb:  My God
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night
noverb:  Oh
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  He put a hand on
noverb:  side of his head
active:  rocked himself to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  droning to himself
noverb:  a child
active:  grief has got beyond words
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes
noverb:  , with his brows knitted
active:  his eyes fixed upon the fire
active:  Do you receive much company
active:  he asked
active:  None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's
active:  Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately
noverb:  No one else
active:  I think
active:  Do you go out much in society
active:  Arthur does
noverb:  Mary
active:  I stay at home
noverb:  We
noverb:  of us care for it
active:  That is unusual in a young girl
active:  She is of a quiet nature
noverb:  Besides
active:  she is not
noverb:  very young
active:  She is four-and
noverb:  -twenty
noverb:  This matter
noverb:  from
active:  you say
active:  seems to have been a shock to her also
noverb:  Terrible
active:  She is even more affected
noverb:  than I.
active:  You have
noverb:  of you any doubt as to your son's guilt
active:  can we have
active:  I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
active:  I hardly consider
noverb:  a conclusive proof
active:  Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was twisted
active:  Do you not think
active:  he might have been trying to straighten it
active:  God bless you
active:  You are doing
active:  you can for him
noverb:  for me
active:  it is too heavy
noverb:  a task
active:  was he doing there at all
active:  his purpose were innocent
active:  did he not say
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And
active:  it were guilty
noverb:  ,
active:  did he not invent a lie
active:  His silence appears to me
active:  to cut
noverb:  ways
active:  There are several singular points about the case
active:  did the police think of the noise
active:  awoke you from your sleep
active:  They considered
passive: it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door
noverb:  A likely story
noverb:  As
passive: a man bent
active:  on felony would slam his door
active:  to wake a household
active:  did they say
noverb:  of the disappearance of these gems
active:  They are still sounding the planking
active:  probing the furniture in the hope
active:  finding them
noverb:  Have they thought
active:  looking outside the house
noverb:  Yes
active:  they have shown extraordinary energy
passive: The whole garden has already been minutely examined
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  said Holmes
active:  is it not obvious
noverb:  to you now
active:  this matter really strikes very much deeper
noverb:  you
active:  the police were at first inclined to think
novoice: It appeared to
noverb:  you
active:  to be a simple case
active:  to me it seems exceedingly complex
active:  Consider
passive: is involved by your theory
active:  You suppose
active:  your son came down from his bed
active:  went, at great risk, to your dressing-room
noverb:  opened your bureau
active:  took out your coronet
active:  broke off by main force a small portion of it
active:  went off to some other place
active:  concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine
noverb:  with such skill
active:  nobody can find them
novoice: returned with the other thirty-six into the room in
active:  he exposed himself to the greatest danger
passive: being discovered
active:  I ask you now
active:  is such a theory tenable
noverb:  other is there
active:  cried the banker with a gesture of despair
active:  his motives were innocent
active:  does he not explain them
active:  It is our task
active:  to find
noverb:  out
active:  replied Holmes
noverb:  now

noverb:  Yes
active:  she was the girl
noverb:  who waited in the drawing-room
active:  may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet
active:  I see
active:  You infer
active:  she may have gone out
active:  to tell her sweetheart
active:  the two may have planned the robbery
active:  is the good of all these vague theories
active:  cried the banker impatiently
active:  when I have told you

active:  We must come back to that
noverb:  About this girl

noverb:  a magician
active:  said she
active:  do you know that
active:  She smiled
active:  there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin
noverb:  eager face
active:  I should be very glad now
active:  to go upstairs
active:  said he
active:  I shall probably wish
active:  to go over the
noverb:  of the house again
active:  Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows
active:  I go up
active:  He walked swiftly round from one to the other
active:  pausing only at the large one
active:  looked from the hall onto the stable lane
noverb:  This
active:  he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens

noverb:  a large bureau
noverb:  a long mirror

noverb:  of the cupboard of the lumber-room
noverb:  Have you it here
active:  That is it on the dressing-table
active:  Sherlock Holmes took it up
active:  opened the bureau
active:  It is a noiseless lock
active:  said he
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that it did not wake you
noverb:  This case
active:  I presume
active:  contains the coronet
active:  We must have a look at it
active:  He opened the case
active:  taking out the diadem
active:  he laid it upon the table
active:  It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art

active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
active:  a corner holding three gems
passive: had been torn away

noverb:  without result
active:  I feel
active:  it give a little
active:  said he
active:  I am exceptionally strong
noverb:  in the fingers
noverb:  it would take me all my time
active:  to break it
active:  An ordinary man could not do it
noverb:  Now,
active:  do you
active:  think would happen
active:  I did break it, Mr. Holder
active:  There would be a noise
noverb:  like a pistol shot
active:  Do you tell me
noverb:  all this happened within a few yards of your bed
active:  you heard nothing of it
active:  I do not know
active:  to think
active:  It is all dark to me
active:  perhaps it may grow lighter
active:  we go
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  I confess
noverb:  I still share my uncle's perplexity
active:  Your son had no shoes or slippers on
active:  you saw him
noverb:  He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
active:  Thank you
passive: We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry
active:  it will be entirely our own fault
active:  we do not succeed
active:  clearing the matter up
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I shall
active:  now continue my investigations
active:  He went alone, at his own request, for he explained
active:  any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
noverb:  For an hour
active:  he was at work
active:  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features
active:  I think

active:  said he
noverb:  I can serve you best
active:  returning to my rooms
noverb:  the gems, Mr. Holmes

noverb:  , for God's sake,
active:  was this dark business
active:  was acted in my house last night

active:  to do
active:  I can to make it clearer

active:  He hurried to his chamber
novoice: was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
novoice: With his collar turned up
noverb:  his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots
active:  he was a perfect sample of the class
active:  I think
active:  this should do
active:  said he
active:  glancing into the glass above the fireplace
active:  I only wish
active:  you could come with me
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
noverb:  it won't do
active:  I may be on the trail in this matter

noverb:  return to my highly respectable self
active:  I could see by his manner

noverb:  And

active:  I fancy
active:  Have you your check-book? Here is a pen
noverb:  Better make it out for $4000
active:  With a dazed face the banker made out the required check
novoice: Holmes walked over to his desk

active:  I saw
active:  Boots had faced round
passive: the snow was cut up as
active:  there had been a struggle
noverb:  finally
active:  a few drops of blood had fallen
active:  to show me
passive: I was not mistaken
active:  Boots had
active:  run down the lane
active:  another little smudge of blood showed
active:  it was he
passive: had been hurt

active:  had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent
noverb:  So far
active:  I was clear
active:  The question now was
noverb:  who was the man
noverb:  who was it
noverb:  brought him the coronet
active:  It is an old maxim of mine
active:  you have excluded the impossible
noverb:  remains
noverb:  however improbable
active:  must be the truth
noverb:  Now,
active:  I knew
active:  it was not you
active:  had brought it down
active:  there only remained your niece and the maids
active:  it were the maids
active:  should your son allow himself
passive: to be accused in their place
active:  There could be no possible reason
noverb:  As he loved his cousin
noverb:  however
active:  there was an excellent explanation
noverb:  why he should retain her secret
noverb:  the
active:  the secret was a disgraceful one
active:  When I remembered
active:  you had seen her at that window

noverb:  And
active:  could it be

active:  being a man of evil reputation among women
active:  It must have been he
active:  wore those boots
active:  retained the missing gems
active:  he knew
active:  Arthur had discovered him
active:  he might still
active:  flatter himself
active:  he was safe
noverb:  , for the lad could not say a word
active:  compromising his own family
noverb:  Well,
active:  your own good sense will suggest
noverb:  measures I took next
active:  I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house

active:  said Mr. Holder
noverb:  Precisely
active:  It was I. I
active:  found
active:  I had my man
active:  I came home
active:  changed my clothes
active:  It was a delicate part
active:  I had
active:  to play
noverb:  for I saw
passive: a prosecution must be avoided
active:  to avert scandal
active:  I knew
noverb:  so astute a villain would see
active:  our hands
passive: were tied in the matter
active:  I went and saw him
active:  At first, of course, he denied everything
noverb:  I gave him every particular
active:  had occurred
active:  he tried
active:  to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall
active:  I knew my man
noverb:  however
active:  I clapped a pistol to his head
active:  he could strike
active:  he became a little more reasonable
active:  I told him
noverb:  we would give him a price for the stones he held
noverb:  $1000 apiece
active:  That brought out the first signs of grief
active:  he had shown
noverb:  dash it all
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I've let them go at six hundred for the three
active:  I soon managed
active:  to get the address of the receiver
active:  had them
active:  promising him
active:  there would be no prosecution
novoice: Off I set to him
noverb:  after much chaffering
active:  I got our stones at $1000 apiece
novoice: Then I looked in upon your son
active:  told him
noverb:  all was right
active:  eventually got to my bed about two o'clock
noverb:  after
active:  I may call a really hard day's work
noverb:  A day
active:  has saved England from a great public scandal
active:  said the banker, rising
noverb:  Sir
active:  I cannot find words
active:  to thank you
active:  you shall not find me ungrateful for
active:  you have done
active:  Your skill has indeed exceeded all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  it
active:  And now I must fly to my dear boy
active:  to apologise to him for the wrong
active:  I have done him
noverb:  As to
active:  you tell me of poor Mary
active:  it goes to my very heart
active:  Not even your skill can inform me
active:  she is now
active:  I think
active:  we may safely say
active:  returned Holmes
active:  she is
active:  Sir George Burnwell is
active:  It is equally certain
noverb:  , too
active:  her sins are
active:  they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment

noverb:  To the man
noverb:  loves art for its own sake
active:  remarked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph
active:  it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations
active:  the keenest pleasure is to be derived
active:  It is pleasant
noverb:  to me
active:  to observe
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have so far grasped this truth
noverb:  in these little records of our cases
active:  you have been good enough
active:  to draw up
passive: I am bound
active:  to say
noverb:  occasionally
active:  to embellish
active:  you have given prominence not
noverb:  much to the many causes celebres
noverb:  sensational trials in
active:  I have figured
noverb:  rather to those incidents
active:  may have been trivial in themselves
active:  have given room for those faculties of deduction
noverb:  of logical synthesis
active:  I have made my special province
noverb:  And
active:  said I
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism
passive: has been urged against my records
active:  You have erred
noverb:  perhaps
active:  he observed
active:  taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs
noverb:  lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe
active:  was wont
active:  to replace his clay
active:  he was in a disputatious rather
noverb:  a meditative mood
active:  you have erred perhaps
active:  attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead
active:  confining yourself to the task
active:  placing upon record
noverb:  severe reasoning from cause to effect
active:  is really the only notable feature about the thing
active:  It seems to me
active:  I have done
active:  you full justice in the matter
active:  I remarked with some coldness
noverb:  for I was repelled by the egotism
passive: I had more than once observed
active:  to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character
noverb:  No
active:  it is not selfishness
noverb:  or conceit
active:  said he
noverb:  answering
active:  was his wont
noverb:  my thoughts rather
noverb:  my words
noverb:  If I claim full justice for my art
active:  it is
active:  it is an impersonal thing
noverb:  --a thing beyond myself
active:  Crime is common
active:  Logic is rare
active:  Therefore it is upon the logic rather
noverb:  upon the crime
active:  you should dwell
active:  You have degraded
active:  should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
active:  It was a cold morning of the early spring
active:  we sat after breakfast on
noverb:  side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street
novoice: A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses
novoice: the opposing windows loomed
noverb:  dark
noverb:  shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths
passive: Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china
noverb:  metal
passive: for the table had not been cleared yet
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning
active:  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last
active:  having apparently given up his search
active:  he had emerged in no very sweet temper
active:  to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
noverb:  At the same time
active:  he remarked after a pause
noverb:  during
active:  he had sat puffing at his long pipe
active:  gazing down into the fire
active:  you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism
noverb:  for out of these cases
active:  you have been so kind as
active:  to interest yourself in
active:  a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all
noverb:  The small matter in
active:  I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem
novoice: connected with the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  the incident of the noble bachelor
active:  were all matters
active:  are outside the pale of the law
active:  avoiding the sensational
active:  I fear
active:  you may have bordered on the trivial
active:  The end may have been
active:  I answered
noverb:  the methods
active:  I hold to have been novel
noverb:  of interest
noverb:  Pshaw
noverb:  my dear fellow
active:  do the public
noverb:  the great unobservant public
active:  could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb
noverb:  care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction
noverb:  indeed
active:  you are trivial
active:  I cannot blame you
active:  for the days of the great cases are past
noverb:  Man
noverb:  at least criminal man
active:  has lost all enterprise and originality
noverb:  As to my own little practice
active:  it seems
active:  to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils
noverb:  giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools
active:  I think
active:  I have touched bottom at last
noverb:  however
noverb:  This note
active:  I had this morning marks my zero-point
active:  I fancy
active:  Read
noverb:  it
active:  He tossed a crumpled letter across to me

active:  I asked
noverb:  Not I.
active:  It is half-past
noverb:  ten now
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  is her ring
active:  It may turn out
active:  to be of more interest
active:  you think
active:  You remember
noverb:  the affair of the blue carbuncle
active:  appeared to be a mere whim at first
noverb:  developed into a serious investigation
active:  It may be
noverb:  in this case
noverb:  also
noverb:  Well,
novoice: let us hope
active:  our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  is the person in question
noverb:  As he spoke the door
novoice: opened
active:  a young lady entered the room
active:  She was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled
noverb:  a plover's egg
noverb:  with the brisk manner of a woman
active:  has had her own way
active:  to make in the world
noverb:  You will excuse my troubling you
active:  I am sure
active:  said she
noverb:  as my companion rose
active:  to greet her
active:  I have had a very strange experience
active:  I have no parents or relations of any sort from
active:  I could ask advice
active:  I thought
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you would be kind enough
active:  to tell me
active:  I should do
noverb:  Pray take a seat
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to do anything
active:  I can to serve you
active:  I could see

noverb:  his finger-tips together
active:  to listen to her story
active:  I have been a governess for five years
active:  said she
noverb:  in the family of Colonel Spence Munro
noverb:  two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia,
active:  took his children over to America with him
active:  I found myself without a situation
active:  I advertised
active:  I answered advertisements
noverb:  without success
noverb:  At last the little money
active:  I had saved
active:  began
active:  to run short
active:  I was at my wit's end as to
active:  I should do
active:  There is a well-known agency
active:  for governesses in the West End called Westaway's
noverb:  there
active:  I used
active:  to call about once a week in order
active:  to see
active:  anything had turned up
active:  might suit me
active:  Westaway was the name of the founder of the business
passive: it is really managed by Miss Stoper

noverb:  Well,
active:  I called last week

active:  Miss Stoper was not alone
noverb:  A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin
passive: rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose
noverb:  looking very earnestly at the ladies
active:  entered
active:  As I came in
active:  he gave quite a jump in his chair
passive: turned quickly to Miss Stoper
active:  That will do
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not ask for anything better
noverb:  Capital! capital
active:  He seemed quite enthusiastic
active:  rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion
active:  He was such a comfortable-looking man
active:  it was quite a pleasure
active:  to look at him
active:  You are looking for a situation, miss
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  As governess
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And
noverb:  salary do you ask
active:  I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut! sweating
noverb:  rank sweating
active:  he cried
active:  throwing his fat
active:  hands out into the air
noverb:  a man
active:  is in a boiling passion
active:  could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments
active:  My accomplishments, sir, may be less than
active:  you imagine
active:  said I. 'A little French
noverb:  , a little German
noverb:  , music
noverb:  drawing
noverb:  Tut
noverb:  tut
active:  he cried
active:  This is all quite beside the question
active:  The point is
active:  have you
noverb:  have you not the bearing
noverb:  deportment of a lady
noverb:  There
active:  it is in a nutshell
active:  you have not
passive: you are not fitted for the rearing of a child
noverb:  may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country
active:  you have
active:  could any gentleman ask you
active:  to condescend to accept anything under the three figures
active:  Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year
active:  You may imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  to me
noverb:  destitute
active:  I was
novoice: such an offer seemed almost too good
active:  to be true
noverb:  The gentleman
noverb:  however
active:  seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
active:  opened a pocket-book
active:  took out a note
active:  It is also my custom
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face
active:  to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand
active:  they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe
active:  It seemed to me
active:  I had never met
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  so thoughtful a man
active:  As I was already in debt to my tradesmen
active:  the advance was a great convenience
active:  there was something
noverb:  unnatural about the whole transaction
noverb:  made me wish
active:  to know a little
noverb:  I quite committed myself
active:  May I ask
noverb:  you live
noverb:  sir
active:  said I.
noverb:  Hampshire
noverb:  Charming rural place
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  five miles on the far side of Winchester

noverb:  And my duties
noverb:  sir
active:  I should be glad
active:  to know
active:  they would be
noverb:  One child
noverb:  one dear little romper just six years old
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper
noverb:  Smack! smack! smack
active:  Three gone
active:  you could wink
active:  He leaned back in his chair
active:  laughed his eyes into his head again
active:  I was a little
novoice: startled at the nature of the child's amusement
novoice: the father's laughter made me think
active:  perhaps he was joking
noverb:  My sole duties
active:  I asked
active:  are to take charge of a single child
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  not the sole
active:  not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried
active:  Your duty would be
active:  I am sure your good sense
active:  would suggest
active:  to obey any little commands
active:  my wife might give
novoice: provided always
active:  they were such commands
active:  a lady might with propriety obey
active:  You see no difficulty, heh
active:  I should be happy
active:  to make myself useful
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  In dress now
noverb:  for example
active:  We are faddy people
active:  you know
noverb:  faddy
noverb:  kind-hearted
passive: you were asked
active:  to wear any dress
active:  we might give you
active:  you would not object to our little whim
noverb:  Heh
noverb:  No
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  considerably astonished at his words
noverb:  Or
active:  to sit here
active:  sit there
active:  that would not be offensive to you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  Or
active:  to cut your hair quite short
noverb:  before you come to us
active:  I could hardly believe my ears
noverb:  As you may observe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  my hair is somewhat luxuriant
noverb:  of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut
active:  It has been considered artistic
active:  I could not dream
active:  sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that
active:  is quite impossible
active:  said
active:  I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes
active:  I could see a shadow
active:  pass over his face as I spoke
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it is quite essential
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  It is a little fancy of my wife's
noverb:  ladies' fancies
active:  you know
noverb:  madam
passive: ladies' fancies must be consulted
noverb:  And
noverb:  you won't cut your hair
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I really could not
active:  I answered firmly
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  very well
noverb:  quite settles the matter
active:  It is a pity
active:  in other respects
active:  you would really have done very nicely
noverb:  In
noverb:  case
noverb:  Miss Stoper
active:  I had
active:  best inspect a few
noverb:  of your young ladies
active:  The manageress had sat all this
noverb:  busy with her papers without a word to
noverb:  of us
active:  she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face
active:  I could not help
active:  suspecting
active:  she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
active:  Do you desire your name
passive: to be kept upon the books
active:  she asked
noverb:  you
noverb:  Miss Stoper
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  it seems rather useless
active:  you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion
active:  said
noverb:  she sharply
active:  You can hardly expect us
active:  to exert ourselves
active:  to find another such opening for you
noverb:  Good-day to you, Miss Hunter
active:  She struck a gong upon the table
passive: I was shown out by the page
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got back to my lodgings
noverb:  found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table
active:  I began to ask myself
active:  I had not done a very foolish thing
noverb:  After all
active:  these people had strange fads
noverb:  expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters
active:  they were at least ready
active:  to pay for their eccentricity
active:  Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year
noverb:  Besides
active:  use was my hair to me
passive: Many people are improved
active:  wearing
active:  it short
active:  perhaps I should be among the number
noverb:  Next day I was inclined
active:  to think
active:  I had made a mistake
noverb:  by the day after
active:  I was sure
noverb:  of it
active:  I had almost overcome my pride
active:  to go back to the agency
active:  inquire
active:  the place was still open
noverb:  I received this letter from the gentleman himself
active:  I have it here
active:  I will read it to you
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  near Winchester
noverb:  DEAR MISS HUNTER
active:  Miss Stoper has very kindly
noverb:  given me your address
active:  I write from here
active:  to ask you
active:  you have reconsidered your decision
active:  My wife is very anxious
active:  you should come
noverb:  for she has been much
novoice: attracted by my description of you
active:  We are willing
active:  to give $30 a quarter
noverb:  $120 a year
active:  to recompense you for any little inconvenience
active:  our fads may cause you
active:  They are not very exacting
noverb:  , after all
active:  My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue
active:  would like you
active:  to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
active:  You need not
noverb:  however
active:  go to the expense
active:  purchasing one
active:  we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia)
active:  would
active:  I should think
novoice: fit you very well
noverb:  as to sitting here
noverb:  there
noverb:  amusing yourself in any manner indicated
noverb:  that need cause you no inconvenience
noverb:  As regards your hair
active:  it is no doubt
noverb:  a pity
noverb:  especially as I could not help
active:  remarking its beauty during our short interview
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must remain firm upon this point
active:  I only hope
active:  the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
noverb:  Your duties
passive: the child is concerned
active:  are very light
active:  Now do try to come
active:  I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester
noverb:  Let me know your train
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  JEPHRO RUCASTLE
active:  That is the letter
active:  I have just received
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: my mind is made up
active:  I will accept it
active:  I thought
noverb:  however
active:  taking the final step
active:  I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Miss Hunter
passive: your mind is made up
active:  that settles the question
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  you would not advise me
active:  to refuse
active:  I confess
active:  it is not the situation
noverb:  which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
active:  is the meaning of it all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Ah
active:  I have no data
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
noverb:  Well,
active:  there seems to me
active:  to be only one possible solution
active:  Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to be a very kind, good-natured man
active:  Is it not possible
noverb:  that his wife is a lunatic
active:  he desires to keep the matter
active:  quiet for fear
passive: she should be taken to an asylum
active:  he humours her fancies in every way in order
active:  to prevent an outbreak
active:  That is a possible solution
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  as matters stand
active:  it is the most probable one
active:  in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
noverb:  the money, Mr. Holmes, the money
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
active:  of course the pay is good
noverb:  too good
active:  That is
active:  makes me uneasy
noverb:  should they give you $120 a year
active:  they could have their pick for $40
active:  There must be some strong reason behind
active:  I thought
noverb:  I told you the circumstances
active:  you would understand afterwards
active:  I wanted your help
active:  I should feel so much stronger
active:  I felt
active:  you were at the back of me
noverb:  Oh
active:  you may carry that feeling away with you
active:  I assure you
active:  your little problem promises to be the most interesting
active:  has come my way for some months
active:  There is something
noverb:  distinctly novel about some of the features
active:  you should find yourself in doubt
noverb:  in danger
noverb:  Danger
noverb:  danger do you foresee
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  It would cease to be a danger
active:  we could define it
active:  said he
noverb:  at any time, day or night
active:  a telegram would bring me down to your help
active:  That is enough
active:  She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
active:  I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now
active:  I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once
noverb:  sacrifice my poor hair to-night
noverb:  start for Winchester to-morrow
active:  With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
noverb:  good-night
novoice: bustled off upon her way
noverb:  At least
active:  said I
active:  we heard her quick
noverb:  firm steps descending the stairs
active:  she seems to be a young lady
noverb:  who is very well able
active:  to take care of herself
active:  And she would need
active:  to be
active:  said Holmes gravely
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  we do not hear from her
active:  many days are past
active:  It was not very long
noverb:  before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
active:  A fortnight went by
noverb:  during
active:  I frequently found
active:  my thoughts turning in her direction
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
noverb:  The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a fad
noverb:  a plot
active:  the man were a philanthropist or a villain
active:  it was quite beyond my powers
active:  to determine
noverb:  As to Holmes
active:  I observed
active:  he sat frequently for half an hour on end
noverb:  with knitted brows
noverb:  an abstracted air
active:  he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand
active:  I mentioned it
noverb:  Data! data! data
active:  he cried impatiently
noverb:  I can't make bricks without clay
noverb:  And
active:  he would always wind up
active:  muttering
noverb:  no sister of his should ever
active:  have accepted such a situation
noverb:  The telegram
active:  we eventually received
active:  came late one night just
active:  I was thinking
active:  turning in
active:  Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches
novoice: he frequently indulged in
active:  I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night
active:  find him in the same position
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning
active:  He opened the yellow envelope
active:  glancing at the message
active:  threw it across to me
active:  Just look up the trains in Bradshaw
active:  said he
noverb:  turned back to his chemical studies
active:  The summons was a brief
noverb:  urgent one
active:  be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow
active:  it said
active:  Do come
active:  I am at my wit's end
noverb:  HUNTER
active:  Will you come with me
active:  asked Holmes
active:  glancing up
active:  I should wish to
noverb:  Just look it up
active:  There is a train
noverb:  at half-past nine
active:  said I
active:  glancing over my Bradshaw
active:  It is due
noverb:  at Winchester at 11
noverb:  30
active:  That will do very nicely
active:  perhaps I had
active:  better postpone my analysis of the acetones
noverb:  as we may need
active:  to be at our best in the morning
noverb:  By eleven o'clock the next day
active:  we were well upon our way to the old English capital
active:  Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down
noverb:  after we had passed the Hampshire border
active:  he threw them down
active:  began to admire the scenery
noverb:  It was an ideal spring day
noverb:  a light blue sky
passive: flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east
active:  The sun was shining very brightly
active:  there was an exhilarating nip in the air
novoice: set an edge to a man's energy
noverb:  All over the countryside
noverb:  away to the rolling hills around Aldershot
novoice: the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
active:  Are they not fresh
noverb:  beautiful
active:  I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  it is one
noverb:  of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine
active:  I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject
active:  You look at these scattered houses
passive: you are impressed by their beauty
active:  I look at them
noverb:  the only thought
active:  comes
active:  to me is a feeling of their isolation
noverb:  and of the impunity with
passive: crime may be committed there
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
active:  They always fill me with a certain horror
active:  It is my belief, Watson
passive: founded upon my experience
active:  the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
active:  does the smiling and beautiful countryside
active:  You horrify me
active:  the reason is very obvious
active:  The pressure of public opinion can do in the town
active:  the law cannot accomplish
active:  There is no lane
noverb:  so vile
noverb:  the scream of a tortured child
noverb:  the thud of a drunkard's blow
active:  does not beget sympathy
noverb:  indignation among the neighbours
active:  the whole machinery of justice is
noverb:  close
noverb:  a word of complaint can set it going
active:  there is
noverb:  a step between the crime and the dock
active:  look at these lonely houses
noverb:  each in its own fields
passive: filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk
active:  know little of the law
noverb:  Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty
noverb:  the hidden wickedness
active:  may go on
noverb:  year in
noverb:  year out, in such places, and none the wiser
active:  Had this lady
active:  appeals
active:  to us for help gone
active:  to live in Winchester
active:  I should never have had a fear for her
active:  It is the five miles of country
noverb:  which makes the danger
noverb:  Still,
active:  it is clear
noverb:  that she is not personally threatened
noverb:  No
active:  she can come to Winchester
active:  to meet us
active:  she can get away
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  She has her freedom
active:  can be the matter
active:  Can you suggest no explanation
active:  I have devised seven separate explanations
noverb:  each of
active:  would cover the facts
active:  we know them
noverb:  of these is correct
passive: can only be determined by the fresh information
active:  we shall no doubt find waiting for us
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is the tower of the cathedral
active:  we shall soon learn all
active:  Miss Hunter has
active:  to tell
active:  The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street
noverb:  at no distance from the station
noverb:  there
active:  we found the young lady waiting for us
active:  She had engaged a sitting-room
active:  our lunch awaited us upon the table
active:  I am so delighted
noverb:  that you have come
active:  she said earnestly
active:  It is
noverb:  very kind of you
active:  indeed I do not know
active:  I should do
active:  Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
active:  Pray
active:  tell us
active:  has happened to
noverb:  you
active:  I will do
active:  I must be quick
noverb:  , for I have promised Mr. Rucastle
active:  to be back
noverb:  three
active:  I got his leave
active:  to come into town this morning
active:  he little knew for
noverb:  purpose
noverb:  Let us have everything in its due order
noverb:  Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire
active:  composed himself
active:  to listen
noverb:  In the first place
active:  I may say
active:  I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
active:  It is only fair
noverb:  to them
active:  to say that
active:  But I cannot understand them
active:  I am not easy
noverb:  in my mind about them
active:  can you not understand
noverb:  Their reasons for their conduct
active:  you shall have it all just
active:  it occurred
active:  When I came down
novoice: Mr. Rucastle met me here
active:  drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches
active:  It is
noverb:  as he said
noverb:  beautifully situated
active:  it is not beautiful
noverb:  in itself
active:  for it is a large square block of a house
noverb:  whitewashed
noverb:  all stained
novoice: streaked with damp
noverb:  bad weather
novoice: There are grounds round it
noverb:  woods on three sides
noverb:  on the fourth a field
active:  slopes down to the Southampton highroad
passive: curves past about a hundred yards from the front door
noverb:  This ground in front belongs to the house
noverb:  the woods all round
active:  are part of Lord Southerton's preserves
active:  A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
passive: I was driven over by my employer
active:  was
passive: was introduced by him
active:  evening to his wife and the child
active:  There was no truth
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  in the conjecture
active:  seemed to us
active:  to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street
active:  Mrs. Rucastle is not mad
active:  I found her
active:  to be a silent, pale-faced woman
noverb:  much younger
noverb:  her husband
noverb:  not more than thirty
active:  I should think
active:  he can hardly be less than forty-five
active:  From their conversation I have gathered
active:  they have been married about seven years
active:  he was a widower
active:  his only child by the first wife was the daughter
active:  has gone to Philadelphia
active:  Mr. Rucastle told me in private
noverb:  the reason
active:  she had left
active:  them was
active:  she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother
active:  As the daughter could not have been less than twenty
active:  I can quite imagine
active:  her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife
active:  Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me
active:  to be colourless in mind
noverb:  in feature
active:  She impressed me
noverb:  favourably
noverb:  the reverse
active:  She was a nonentity
active:  It was easy
active:  to see
passive: she was passionately devoted
noverb:  to her husband
noverb:  to her little son
noverb:  Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other
active:  noting every little want
active:  forestalling it
noverb:  possible
active:  He was kind
noverb:  to her also in his bluff
noverb:  boisterous fashion
noverb:  on the whole
active:  they seemed to be a happy couple
noverb:  And
active:  she had some secret sorrow
noverb:  this woman
passive: She would often be lost in deep thought
noverb:  with the saddest look upon her face
active:  More than once I have surprised her in tears
active:  I have thought sometimes
active:  it was the disposition of her child
active:  weighed upon her mind
noverb:  for I have never met
noverb:  utterly spoiled
noverb:  so ill-natured a little creature
active:  He is small
noverb:  for his age
noverb:  with a head
active:  is quite disproportionately large
active:  His whole life appears
passive: to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals
active:  sulking
noverb:  Giving pain to any creature weaker
active:  himself seems to be his one idea of amusement
active:  he shows quite remarkable talent
active:  planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects
active:  But I would rather not talk about the creature
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  indeed
active:  he has little
active:  to do with my story
active:  I am glad
noverb:  of all details
active:  remarked my friend
active:  they seem to
noverb:  you
active:  to be relevant
noverb:  not
active:  I shall try not
active:  to miss anything of importance
noverb:  The one unpleasant thing about the house
active:  struck me at once
active:  was the appearance and conduct of the servants
active:  There are only two
noverb:  , a man and his wife
noverb:  Toller
noverb:  for
active:  is his name
active:  is a rough, uncouth man
noverb:  with grizzled hair and whiskers
noverb:  a perpetual smell of drink
noverb:  Twice
active:  I have been with them
active:  he has been quite drunk
novoice: Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to take no notice of it
active:  His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  much less amiable
active:  They are a most unpleasant couple
active:  fortunately I spend
noverb:  of my time in the nursery
noverb:  my own room
active:  are next to each other in one corner of the building
active:  For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet
noverb:  on the third
active:  Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  turning to me
active:  we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter,
active:  falling in with our whims
active:  to cut your hair
active:  I assure you
active:  it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance
active:  We shall now see
active:  the electric-blue dress will become you
active:  You will find
active:  it laid out upon the bed in your room
active:  you would be so good
noverb:  as
active:  to put it on we should
active:  be extremely obliged
noverb:  The dress
active:  I found
noverb:  waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue
active:  It was of excellent material
noverb:  a sort of beige
active:  it bore unmistakable signs
passive: having been worn before
active:  It could not have been a better fit
passive: I had been measured for
noverb:  it
noverb:  Both Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it
active:  seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence
active:  They were waiting for me in the drawing-room
active:  is a very large room
noverb:  stretching along the entire front of the house
active:  with three long windows reaching down to the floor
active:  A chair had been placed close to the central window
novoice: with its back turned towards
noverb:  it
passive: In this I was asked
active:  to sit
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
novoice: walking up and down on the other side of the room
noverb:  began to tell me a series of the funniest stories
active:  I have ever listened to
active:  You cannot imagine
noverb:  comical he was
active:  I laughed
active:  I was quite weary
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
noverb:  however
active:  has evidently no sense of humour
noverb:  never
novoice: smiled
noverb:  sat with her hands in her lap
noverb:  a sad, anxious look upon her face
noverb:  After an hour
active:  Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked
active:  it was time
active:  to commence the duties of the day
active:  I might change my dress
active:  go to little Edward in the nursery
noverb:  Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances
active:  Again I changed my dress
active:  again I sat in the window
active:  again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of
active:  my employer had an immense repertoire
active:  he told inimitably
noverb:  he handed me a yellow-backed novel
active:  moving my chair a little sideways
active:  my own shadow might not fall upon the page
active:  he begged me
active:  to read aloud to him
active:  I read for about ten minutes
noverb:  beginning in the heart of a chapter
active:  suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me
active:  to cease
active:  to change my dress
active:  You can easily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  curious I became as to
active:  the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be
active:  They were always very careful
active:  I observed
active:  to turn my face away from the window
active:  I became consumed with the desire
active:  to see
active:  was going on behind my back
noverb:  At first it seemed
active:  to be impossible
active:  I soon devised a means
noverb:  My hand-mirror had been broken
active:  a happy thought seized me
active:  I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief
noverb:  On the next occasion
noverb:  in the midst of my laughter
active:  I put my handkerchief up to my eyes
active:  was able with a little management
active:  to see all
active:  there was behind me
active:  I confess
passive: I was disappointed
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  At least
active:  was my first impression
noverb:  At the second glance
noverb:  however
active:  I perceived
active:  there was a man standing in the Southampton Road
active:  a small bearded man in a grey suit
active:  seemed
active:  to be looking in my direction
active:  The road is an important highway
novoice: there are usually people there
noverb:  This man
noverb:  however
active:  was leaning against the railings
active:  bordered our field
active:  was looking earnestly up
active:  I lowered my handkerchief
active:  glanced at Mrs. Rucastle
active:  to find
active:  her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze
active:  She said nothing
passive: I am convinced
active:  she had divined
active:  I had a mirror in my hand
active:  had seen
active:  was behind me
active:  She rose at once
noverb:  Jephro
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there
noverb:  stares up at Miss Hunter
noverb:  No friend of yours
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  he asked
noverb:  No
active:  I know no one in these parts
noverb:  Dear me
noverb:  very impertinent
noverb:  Kindly turn round
noverb:  motion to him
active:  to go away
noverb:  Surely
active:  it would be better
active:  to take no notice
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  we should have him loitering here always
noverb:  Kindly turn round
active:  wave him away
noverb:  that
active:  I did
passive: I was told
active:  at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind
active:  That was a week ago
noverb:  from
active:  time
active:  I have not sat again in the window
noverb:  have I worn the blue dress
active:  seen the man in the road
active:  Pray
active:  continue
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Your narrative promises
active:  to be a most interesting one
active:  You will find it rather disconnected
active:  I fear
active:  there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
active:  I speak
noverb:  On the very first day
active:  I was at the Copper Beeches
active:  Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse
noverb:  stands near the kitchen door
active:  we approached it
active:  I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
noverb:  the sound as of a large animal moving about
noverb:  Look in here
active:  said Mr. Rucastle
noverb:  showing me a slit between two planks
noverb:  Is he not a beauty
active:  I looked through
active:  was conscious of two glowing eyes
novoice: of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
passive: Don't be frightened
active:  said
noverb:  my employer
active:  laughing at the start
active:  I had given
active:  It's only Carlo
noverb:  my mastiff
active:  I call him mine
noverb:  really old Toller
noverb:  my groom
active:  is the only man
active:  can do anything with him
noverb:  We feed him once a day
noverb:  not too much
active:  he is always
noverb:  mustard
noverb:  Toller lets him loose every night
active:  God help the trespasser
active:  he lays his fangs upon
noverb:  For goodness' sake don't you
novoice: on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night
noverb:  for it's
active:  your life is worth
noverb:  The warning was no idle one
active:  for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
active:  It was a beautiful moonlight night
passive: the lawn in front of the house was silvered over
noverb:  almost
noverb:  day
active:  I was standing
noverb:  rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene
active:  I was aware
active:  that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches
active:  it emerged into the moonshine
active:  I saw
active:  it was
active:  It was a giant dog
noverb:  a calf
noverb:  tawny tinted
noverb:  with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones
active:  It walked slowly across the lawn
novoice: vanished into the shadow upon the other side
active:  dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
active:  I do not think
active:  any burglar could have done
active:  And now I have a very strange experience
active:  to tell you
active:  I had
active:  you know
active:  cut off my hair in London
active:  I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk
noverb:  One evening
active:  after the child was in bed
active:  I began to amuse myself
active:  examining the furniture of my room
active:  rearranging my own little things
active:  There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open
noverb:  the lower one locked
noverb:  I had filled the first two with my linen
active:  I had still much
noverb:  to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
active:  It struck me
passive: it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
active:  I took out my bunch of keys
active:  tried
active:  to open it
active:  The very first key fitted to perfection
active:  I drew the drawer open
active:  There was only one thing in it
active:  I am sure
active:  you would never guess
active:  it was
active:  It was my coil of hair
active:  I took it up
active:  examined it
active:  It was of the same peculiar tint
noverb:  the same thickness
active:  the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me
active:  could my hair
passive: have been locked in the drawer
active:  With trembling hands I undid my trunk
passive: turned out the contents
active:  drew from the bottom my own hair
active:  I laid the two tresses together
active:  I assure you
active:  they were identical
active:  Was it not extraordinary
noverb:  Puzzle as I would
active:  I could make nothing at all of
novoice: it meant
active:  I returned the strange hair to the drawer
active:  I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt
active:  I had put myself in the wrong
active:  opening a drawer
active:  they had locked
active:  I am naturally observant
noverb:  , as you may have remarked
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
active:  There was one wing
noverb:  however
active:  appeared not
passive: to be inhabited at all
noverb:  A door
active:  faced
novoice: led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite
passive: it was invariably locked
noverb:  One day
noverb:  however
active:  I ascended the stair
active:  I met Mr. Rucastle
active:  coming out through this door
noverb:  his keys in his hand
noverb:  a look on his face
noverb:  made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to
passive: I was accustomed
active:  His cheeks were red
active:  his brow was all crinkled with anger
active:  the veins stood out at his temples with passion
active:  He locked the door
active:  hurried past me without a word or a look
noverb:  This aroused my curiosity
active:  I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge
active:  I strolled round to the side from
active:  I could see the windows of this part of the house
active:  There were four of them
noverb:  in a row
noverb:  three of
active:  were simply dirty
passive: the fourth was shuttered up
active:  They were evidently all
noverb:  deserted
novoice: As I strolled up and down
active:  glancing at them occasionally
active:  Mr. Rucastle came out to me
noverb:  looking as merry
noverb:  jovial as
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you must not think me rude
active:  I passed you without a word, my dear young lady
passive: I was preoccupied with business matters
active:  I assured him
passive: I was not offended
noverb:  By the way
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there
active:  one of them has the shutters up
active:  He looked surprised
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  a little startled at my remark
active:  Photography is one of my hobbies
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I have made my dark room up there
noverb:  dear me!
noverb:  an observant young lady
active:  we have come upon
active:  would have believed it
active:  would have ever believed it
active:  He spoke in a jesting tone
active:  there was no jest
noverb:  in his eyes
active:  he looked at me
noverb:  I read suspicion there
noverb:  annoyance
noverb:  no jest
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  from the moment
active:  I understood
active:  there was something
noverb:  about that suite of rooms
active:  I was not to know
novoice: I was all
noverb:  on fire
active:  to go over them
active:  It was not mere curiosity
active:  I have my share of that
active:  It was more
noverb:  a feeling of duty
noverb:  a feeling
active:  some good might come from my penetrating to this place
noverb:  They talk of woman's instinct
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it was woman's instinct
active:  gave me
noverb:  feeling
noverb:  At any rate
active:  it was there
noverb:  ,
active:  I was keenly on the lookout for any chance
active:  to pass the forbidden door
active:  It was only yesterday
active:  the chance came
active:  I may tell you
noverb:  , besides Mr. Rucastle,
noverb:  Toller
active:  his wife find something
active:  to do in these deserted rooms
noverb:  I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door
active:  Recently he has been drinking hard
noverb:  yesterday evening
active:  he was very drunk
active:  and when I came upstairs
active:  there was the key in the door
active:  I have no doubt at all
noverb:  he had left it there
noverb:  Mr.
active:  Mrs. Rucastle were
noverb:  downstairs
active:  the child was with them
active:  I had an admirable opportunity
active:  I turned the key gently in the lock
active:  opened the door
novoice: slipped through
active:  There was a little passage in front of me
noverb:  unpapered
noverb:  uncarpeted
active:  turned at a right angle at the farther end
active:  Round
active:  this corner were three doors in a line
noverb:  the first
noverb:  third of
active:  were open
noverb:  They each led into an empty room
noverb:  dusty
noverb:  cheerless
noverb:  with two windows in the one and one in the other
noverb:  thick with dirt
active:  the evening light glimmered dimly through them
passive: The centre door was closed
noverb:  across the
noverb:  of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed
novoice: padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall
novoice: fastened at the other with stout cord
noverb:  The door
passive: itself was locked as well
active:  the key was not there
active:  This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window
active:  I could see by the glimmer from beneath it
active:  the room was not in darkness
noverb:  Evidently
active:  there was a skylight
noverb:  which let in light from above
active:  As I stood
active:  in the passage gazing at the sinister door
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  secret it might veil
novoice: I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
active:  saw a shadow pass backward
noverb:  forward against the little slit of dim light
novoice: shone out from under the door
active:  A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes
active:  My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly
active:  I turned and ran
active:  ran as
active:  some dreadful hand were
active:  behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress
active:  I rushed down the passage, through the door,
noverb:  straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle
active:  was waiting
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  smiling
active:  it was you
active:  I thought
active:  it must be
active:  I saw the door
active:  open
noverb:  Oh
active:  I am so frightened
active:  I panted
noverb:  My dear young lady! my dear young lady
active:  you cannot think
noverb:  caressing
active:  soothing
active:  his manner was
active:  has frightened you, my dear young lady
active:  his voice was just a little too coaxing
active:  He overdid it
active:  I was keenly on my guard against him
active:  I was foolish enough
active:  to go into the empty wing
active:  I answered
active:  it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light
passive: I was frightened and ran out again
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is
noverb:  dreadfully still in there
noverb:  Only that
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  looking at me keenly
noverb:  did you think
active:  I asked
active:  do you think
active:  I lock this door
active:  I am sure
active:  I do not know
active:  It is to keep people out
noverb:  have no business there
noverb:  Do you see
active:  He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
active:  I am sure
active:  I had known
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know now
noverb:  And
noverb:  you
novoice: put your foot over that threshold again
noverb:  here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage
active:  he glared down at me with the face of a demon
active:  I'll throw you to the mastiff
active:  I was so terrified
noverb:  that I do not know
active:  I did
active:  I suppose
active:  I must have rushed past him into my room
active:  I remember nothing
active:  I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
noverb:  Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I could not live there longer without some advice
passive: I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child
active:  They were all horrible to me
active:  If I could only bring you down all would be well
noverb:  Of course I might have fled from the house
active:  my curiosity was almost
noverb:  my fears
passive: My mind was soon made up
noverb:  I would send you a wire
active:  I put on my hat
noverb:  cloak
active:  went down to the office
active:  is about half a mile from the house
novoice: returned
noverb:  feeling very much easier
active:  A horrible doubt came into my mind
active:  I approached the door
active:  the dog might be loose
active:  I remembered
active:  Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility
noverb:  evening
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was the only one in the household
active:  had any influence with the savage creature
noverb:  would venture to set him free
active:  I slipped in in safety
noverb:  lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought
active:  seeing you
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  getting leave
active:  to come into Winchester this morning
active:  I must be back
noverb:  before three o'clock
active:  for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit
active:  will be away all the evening
active:  I must look after the child
active:  Now I have told you
active:  all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad
active:  you could tell me
noverb:  it all means
noverb:  above all
active:  I should do
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
noverb:  My friend rose now
novoice: paced up and down the room
noverb:  his hands in his pockets
noverb:  an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
noverb:  Is Toller still drunk
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
active:  I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle
active:  she could do nothing with him
active:  That is well
active:  And the Rucastles go out to-night?
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Is there a cellar with a good strong lock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  the wine-cellar
active:  You seem to me
active:  to have acted all through this matter
noverb:  a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter
active:  Do you think
active:  you could perform one more feat
active:  I should not ask it of you
noverb:  I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
active:  I will try
active:  is it
active:  We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock
noverb:  my friend
passive: I. The Rucastles will be gone by
noverb:  time
active:  Toller will
active:  we hope
active:  be incapable
active:  There only remains Mrs. Toller
active:  might give the alarm
active:  you could send her into the cellar on some errand
noverb:  turn the key upon her
active:  you would facilitate matters immensely
active:  I will do it
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We shall
noverb:  look thoroughly into the affair
noverb:  Of course
active:  there is only one feasible explanation
active:  You have been brought there
active:  to personate someone
passive: the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
active:  That is obvious
noverb:  As to
active:  this prisoner is
active:  I have no doubt
active:  it is the daughter
noverb:  Miss Alice Rucastle
active:  I remember right
passive: was said
active:  to have gone to America
passive: You were chosen
noverb:  doubtless
active:  resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair
passive: Hers had been cut off
noverb:  very possibly in some illness through
active:  she has passed
active:  , of course, yours had to be sacrificed also
active:  By a curious chance
active:  you came upon her tresses
active:  The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--
noverb:  no doubt
active:  you wore the girl's dress
active:  were
noverb:  her
passive: he was convinced from your laughter
active:  he saw you
noverb:  afterwards from your gesture
active:  Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
active:  she no longer desired his attentions
passive: The dog is let loose at night
active:  to prevent him
active:  endeavouring
active:  to communicate with her
active:  much is fairly clear
active:  The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
active:  on earth has
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  My dear Watson
noverb:  you
active:  a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
noverb:  Don't you see
active:  the converse is equally valid
active:  I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents
active:  studying their children
active:  This child's disposition is abnormally cruel
noverb:  merely for cruelty's sake
active:  he derives this from his smiling father
noverb:  as I should suspect
noverb:  from his mother
active:  it bodes evil for the poor girl
active:  is in their power
active:  I am sure
active:  you are right
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  cried our client
active:  A thousand things come back to me
active:  make me certain
active:  you have hit it
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
active:  We must be circumspect
noverb:  , for we are dealing with a very cunning man
active:  We can do nothing until seven o'clock
active:  At that hour we shall be with
noverb:  you
active:  it will not be long
active:  we solve the mystery
active:  We were
noverb:  our word
active:  for it was just seven
noverb:  when we reached the Copper Beeches
active:  having put up our trap at a wayside public-house
noverb:  The group of trees
noverb:  with their dark leaves shining
noverb:  burnished metal in the light of the setting sun
active:  were sufficient
active:  to mark the house even
active:  had Miss Hunter not
active:  been standing smiling on the door-step
active:  Have you managed it
active:  asked Holmes
active:  A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
active:  That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar
active:  said she
noverb:  Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
active:  Here are his keys
active:  are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's
active:  You have done well indeed
active:  cried Holmes with enthusiasm
active:  Now lead the way
active:  we shall soon see the end of this black business
active:  We passed up the stair
active:  unlocked the door
novoice: followed on down a passage
active:  found ourselves in front of the barricade
active:  Miss Hunter had described
active:  Holmes cut the cord
active:  removed the transverse bar
active:  he tried the various keys in the lock
noverb:  without success
active:  No sound came from within
novoice: at the silence Holmes' face clouded over
active:  I trust
active:  we are not too late
active:  said he
active:  I think
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  we had
active:  better go in without you
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  put your shoulder to it
active:  we shall see
active:  we cannot make our way in
noverb:  It was an old rickety door
active:  gave at once
noverb:  our united strength
active:  Together we rushed into the room
active:  It was empty
active:  There was no
active:  furniture save a little pallet bed
noverb:  a small table
noverb:  a basketful of linen
noverb:  The skylight
active:  was open
active:  the prisoner gone
active:  There has been some villainy here
active:  said Holmes
active:  this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions
active:  has carried his victim off
noverb:  Through the skylight
active:  We shall soon see
active:  he managed it
active:  He swung himself up onto the roof
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  he cried
noverb:  here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
active:  That is
active:  he did it
active:  it is impossible
active:  said Miss Hunter
active:  the ladder was not there
active:  the Rucastles went away
active:  He has come back
active:  done it
active:  I tell you
active:  he is a clever and dangerous man
active:  I should not be very much surprised
active:  this were he
noverb:  step I hear now upon the stair
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  it would be as well for
noverb:  you
active:  to have your pistol
active:  ready
active:  The words were hardly out of his mouth
active:  a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand
novoice: Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang forward
active:  confronted him
noverb:  You villain
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  where's your daughter
noverb:  The fat man cast his eyes round
noverb:  up at the open skylight
active:  It is for me
noverb:  to ask you that
active:  he shrieked
active:  you thieves
noverb:  Spies
noverb:  thieves
active:  I have caught you
active:  have I
active:  You are in my power
active:  I'll serve you
active:  He turned and clattered down the stairs
active:  he could go
active:  He's gone for the dog
active:  cried Miss Hunter
active:  I have my revolver
active:  said I.
noverb:  Better close the front door
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  we all rushed down the stairs together
active:  We had hardly reached the hall
active:  we heard the baying of a hound
noverb:  a scream of agony
noverb:  with a horrible worrying sound
active:  it was dreadful
active:  to listen to
noverb:  An elderly man with a red face
active:  shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
noverb:  My God
active:  he cried
active:  Someone has loosed the dog
active:  It's
passive: not been fed for two days
noverb:  Quick,
noverb:  quick
active:  it'll be too late
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  round the angle of the house
noverb:  with Toller hurrying behind us
active:  There was the huge famished brute
novoice: its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat
active:  he writhed and screamed upon the ground
active:  Running up
active:  I blew its brains out
noverb:  it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
active:  With much labour we separated them
active:  carried him
noverb:  living
noverb:  horribly mangled
noverb:  into the house
active:  We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa
active:  having dispatched the sobered Toller
active:  to bear the news to his wife
active:  I did
active:  I could to relieve his pain
active:  We were all assembled
active:  round him
active:  the door opened
active:  a tall, gaunt woman entered the room
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  cried Miss Hunter
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  miss
active:  Mr. Rucastle let me out
active:  he came back
active:  he went up to you
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  miss
noverb:  it is a pity you didn't let me know
active:  you were planning
noverb:  for I would have told you
active:  your pains
passive: were wasted
noverb:  Ha
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  looking keenly at her
active:  It is clear
active:  that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter
noverb:  anyone else
active:  Yes, sir, I do
active:  I am ready enough
active:  to tell
active:  I know
active:  pray
active:  sit down
noverb:  let us hear
active:  it for there are several points on
active:  I must confess
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I will soon make it clear
noverb:  to you
active:  said she
active:  and I'd have done
noverb:  now
noverb:  I could ha' got out from the cellar
active:  there's police-court business over this
active:  you'll remember
active:  I was the
noverb:  one
active:  stood your friend
active:  I was Miss Alice's friend too
active:  She was never happy
noverb:  at home
noverb:  Miss Alice wasn't
noverb:  from the time
noverb:  her father married again
passive: She was slighted
active:  had no say in anything
active:  it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house
active:  I could learn
active:  Miss Alice had rights of her own
active:  will
active:  she was so quiet and patient
active:  she was
active:  she never said
noverb:  a word about them
active:  just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands
active:  He knew
active:  he was safe
noverb:  with her
active:  there was a chance of a husband coming forward
active:  would ask for all
active:  the law would give him
novoice: her father thought it time
active:  to put a stop on it
active:  He wanted her
active:  to sign a paper
active:  she married
noverb:  not
noverb:  he could use her money
noverb:  When she wouldn't do it
active:  he kept
active:  worrying her
active:  she got brain-fever
active:  for six weeks was at death's door
active:  she got better at last
noverb:  all worn to a shadow
active:  with her beautiful hair cut off
noverb:  didn't make no change in her young man
active:  he stuck to her
active:  man could be
noverb:  Ah
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  you have been good enough
noverb:  to tell us makes the matter fairly clear
noverb:  ,
active:  I can deduce all
noverb:  remains
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
active:  I presume
active:  took to this system of imprisonment
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order
active:  to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler
active:  That was it, sir
active:  Mr. Fowler being a persevering man
active:  as a good seaman should be
active:  blockaded the house
active:  having met
active:  you succeeded by certain arguments
noverb:  metallic
active:  convincing you
active:  your interests
active:  were the same as his
active:  Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman
active:  said Mrs. Toller serenely
noverb:  And in this way
active:  he managed
active:  your good man should have no want of drink
active:  a ladder should be ready at the moment
active:  your master had gone out
active:  You have it
noverb:  sir
noverb:  just
active:  it happened
active:  I am sure
noverb:  we owe you an apology
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  for you have certainly cleared up everything
active:  puzzled us
active:  And here comes the country surgeon
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
active:  it seems to me
noverb:  our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
noverb:  And
active:  was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
active:  Mr. Rucastle survived
active:  was always a broken man
active:  kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife
active:  They still live with their old servants
active:  probably know
noverb:  much of Rucastle's past life
active:  he finds it difficult
active:  to part from them
noverb:  Mr. Fowler
passive: Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight
active:  he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius
noverb:  As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes
noverb:  rather to my disappointment
active:  manifested no further interest in her
active:  once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems
active:  she is now the head of a private school at Walsall
active:  I believe
active:  she has met with considerable success

noverb:  PREFACE
noverb:  As things now stand
noverb:  the course of instruction in American history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
passive: Three separate books are used
noverb:  First,
active:  there is the primary book
active:  is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes
noverb:  Second
active:  there is the advanced text for the seventh
noverb:  eighth grade
noverb:  generally speaking
noverb:  an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words
noverb:  Finally,
active:  there is the
noverb:  high school manual
noverb:  This
noverb:  too
active:  ordinarily follows the beaten path
noverb:  giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters
active:  To put it bluntly
active:  we do not assume
active:  our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades
active:  mathematicians followed the same method
noverb:  high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions
active:  There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism
novoice: advanced above
active:  It is
active:  teachers have learned from bitter experience
noverb:  little history their pupils retain as
noverb:  they pass along the regular route
active:  No teacher of history will deny this
noverb:  Still
active:  it is a standing challenge
active:  to existing methods of historical instruction
active:  the study of history cannot be made truly progressive
noverb:  the study of mathematics, science, and languages
active:  the historians assume a grave responsibility
active:  adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum
active:  the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text
noverb:  more facts
noverb:  dates
noverb:  words
active:  history deserves
noverb:  of the sharp criticism
active:  it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and economics
active:  In this condition of affairs we find our justification
active:  offering a new high school text in American history
active:  Our first contribution is one of omission
passive: The time-honored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out
active:  We frankly hold
active:  pupils know little
noverb:  nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John Smith by the time
active:  they reach the high school
active:  it is useless
active:  to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time
active:  It is worse
noverb:  than useless
active:  It is an offense
noverb:  against the teachers of those subjects
passive: are demonstrated
active:  to be progressive in character
active:  In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles
active:  Our reasons for this are simple
noverb:  The strategy of a campaign
active:  of a single battle is a highly technical
noverb:  usually a highly controversial
noverb:  matter about
active:  experts differ widely
noverb:  In the field of military
noverb:  naval operations most writers
active:  teachers of history are mere novices
active:  To dispose
active:  of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs
noverb:  given
noverb:  Any one
active:  compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign with the account given by Ropes, for instance,
active:  will ask for no further comment
novoice: No youth called upon
active:  to serve our country in arms
active:  would think
active:  turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare
noverb:  The dramatic scene or episode
noverb:  so useful
active:  arousing the interest of the immature pupil
active:  seems out of place in a book
active:  deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's serious responsibilities
active:  It is not upon negative features
noverb:  however
active:  we rest our case
active:  It is rather upon constructive features
noverb:  _First
noverb:  _ We have written a topical
noverb:  not a narrative
noverb:  history
active:  We have tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of each period
active:  bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration
noverb:  _Second
noverb:  _ We have emphasized those historical topics
active:  help to explain
active:  our nation has come to be
active:  it is to-day
noverb:  _Third
noverb:  _ We have dwelt fully upon the social
noverb:  economic aspects of our history
noverb:  especially in relation to the politics of each period
noverb:  _Fourth
noverb:  _ We have treated the causes and results of wars
noverb:  the problems
active:  financing and sustaining armed forces
noverb:  rather
noverb:  military strategy
noverb:  These are the subjects
active:  belong to a history for civilians
noverb:  These are matters
active:  civilians can understand
noverb:  matters
active:  they must understand
active:  they are
noverb:  to play well their part in war and peace
noverb:  _Fifth
noverb:  _
active:  omitting the period of exploration
active:  we have been able
active:  to enlarge the treatment of our own time
active:  We have given special attention to the history of those current questions
active:  must form the subject matter of sound instruction in citizenship
noverb:  _Sixth
noverb:  _ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique characteristics,
active:  is a part of a general civilization
active:  Accordingly we have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations
noverb:  the reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place
noverb:  _Seventh
noverb:  _ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity
noverb:  The study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory
active:  We have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association, reflection, and generalization
novoice: habits calculated
active:  to enlarge
active:  inform the mind
active:  We have been at great pains
active:  to make our text clear
noverb:  , simple
noverb:  direct
active:  we have earnestly sought to stretch the intellects of our readers
active:  to put them upon their mettle
active:  of them will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
active:  The world will soon expect maturity from them
active:  Their achievements will depend upon the possession of other powers
noverb:  memory alone
passive: The effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by the excellence of their judgment
noverb:  the fullness of their information

noverb:  To Sherlock Holmes

noverb:  All emotions
noverb:  one particularly

noverb:  precise

noverb:  Seven
active:  I answered
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I should have thought a little
noverb:  Just a trifle
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  And in practice again
active:  I observe
active:  You did not tell me
noverb:  you intended
active:  to go into harness
active:  do you know
active:  I see it
active:  I deduce it
active:  do I know
active:  you have been getting yourself very wet lately
active:  you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  said I
active:  this is too much
passive: You would certainly have been burned
active:  had you lived a few centuries ago
active:  It is true
noverb:  that I had a country walk on Thursday
active:  came home in a dreadful mess
noverb:  I have changed my clothes I can't imagine
active:  you deduce it
noverb:  As to Mary Jane
active:  she is incorrigible
noverb:  ,
active:  my wife has given her notice
noverb:  there, again, I fail
active:  to see
active:  you work it out
active:  He chuckled to himself
active:  rubbed his long
noverb:  nervous hands together
active:  It is simplicity
noverb:  itself
active:  said he
active:  my eyes tell me
noverb:  on the inside of your left shoe
noverb:  just
active:  the firelight strikes it
active:  the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts
passive: Obviously they have been caused by someone
active:  has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order
active:  to remove crusted mud from it
noverb:  Hence,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  my double deduction
active:  you had been out in vile weather
active:  you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey
noverb:  As to your practice
noverb:  a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform
noverb:  with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger
noverb:  a bulge on the right side of his top-hat
active:  to show
active:  he has secreted his stethoscope

active:  I could not help laughing at the ease with
active:  he explained his process of deduction
noverb:  When I hear you give your reasons
active:  I remarked
active:  the thing always appears to me
active:  to be
noverb:  ridiculously simple
noverb:  I could easily do it myself
noverb:  at each successive instance of your reasoning
passive: I am baffled
active:  you explain your process
noverb:  And
active:  I believe
active:  my eyes
active:  are
noverb:  yours
noverb:  Quite
active:  he answered
active:  lighting a cigarette
active:  throwing himself down into an armchair
active:  You see
active:  you do not observe
active:  The distinction is clear
noverb:  For example
active:  you have frequently seen the steps
active:  lead up from the hall to this room
noverb:  Frequently
noverb:  often
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  some hundreds of times
noverb:  many are there
noverb:  many
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  Quite
active:  You have not observed
noverb:  And
active:  you have seen
active:  That is just my point
noverb:  Now,
active:  I know
active:  there are seventeen steps
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
noverb:  observed
noverb:  By the way
active:  you are interested
noverb:  in these little problems
active:  you are good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences
active:  you may be interested
noverb:  in this

active:  It came by the last post
active:  said he
active:  Read
noverb:  it aloud

noverb:  without
noverb:  signature or address
active:  There will call upon
noverb:  you to-night
noverb:  at a quarter to eight o'clock
active:  it said
noverb:  a gentleman

active:  Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown

noverb:  who may safely be trusted with matters
active:  are of an importance
passive: can hardly be exaggerated
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  Be in your chamber
noverb:  at that hour
active:  do not take it amiss
active:  your visitor wear a mask
active:  This is indeed a mystery
active:  I remarked
active:  do you imagine
active:  it means
active:  I have no data
active:  It is a capital mistake
active:  to theorise
active:  one has data
active:  Insensibly one begins
active:  to twist facts
active:  to suit theories
noverb:  instead of theories
active:  to suit facts
noverb:  the note itself
active:  do you deduce from
noverb:  it
active:  I carefully examined the writing
noverb:  the paper upon
passive: it was written
noverb:  The man
active:  wrote
active:  it was presumably well
active:  to do
active:  I remarked
active:  endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes
passive: Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet
active:  It is peculiarly strong and stiff
noverb:  Peculiar

noverb:  P
noverb:  and a large
noverb:  G
noverb:  with a small
noverb:  t
noverb:  woven into the texture of the paper
noverb:  do you make of that
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  The name of the maker
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  or his monogram
noverb:  rather
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft

passive: The paper was made in Bohemia
active:  I said
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And the man
active:  wrote
active:  the note is a German
active:  Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence
noverb:  This account of you we have
active:  from all quarters received
active:  A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that
active:  It is the German
active:  is
noverb:  uncourteous to his verbs
active:  It only remains, therefore,
active:  to discover
passive: is wanted by this German

noverb:  by the sound
active:  said he
noverb:  Yes

noverb:  Not a bit
noverb:  Doctor

noverb:  with the chest and limbs of a Hercules

noverb:  not
noverb:  I should much prefer to communicate with

active:  I rose to go
novoice: Holmes caught me by the wrist
noverb:  pushed me back into my chair
active:  It is
noverb:  none
active:  said he
active:  You may say
noverb:  this gentleman anything
active:  you may say to me
active:  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders
active:  Then I must begin
active:  said he
active:  binding you
noverb:  to absolute secrecy for two years
noverb:  at the end of
active:  time the matter
active:  will be of no importance
noverb:  At present
active:  it is not too much
active:  to say
active:  it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
active:  I promise
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And I.
active:  You will excuse this mask
active:  continued our strange visitor

noverb:  the title by

active:  To speak plainly
active:  the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein
noverb:  hereditary kings of Bohemia
active:  I was also aware
noverb:  of that
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  settling himself down in his armchair
active:  closing his eyes
active:  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man
active:  had been no doubt
novoice: depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe
active:  Holmes slowly reopened his eyes
active:  looked impatiently at his gigantic client
active:  your Majesty would condescend to state your case
active:  he remarked
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you
active:  The man sprang from his chair
novoice: paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  , with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face
active:  hurled it upon the ground
active:  You are right
active:  he cried

passive: I am not accustomed
active:  to doing such business in my own person
active:  Yet the matter was so delicate
active:  I could not confide it to an agent
active:  putting myself in his power
active:  I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose
active:  consulting you
active:  pray
active:  consult
active:  said Holmes
active:  shutting his eyes once
active:  The facts are briefly these
noverb:  Some five years ago
noverb:  during a lengthy visit to Warsaw

active:  The name is no doubt familiar to you
noverb:  Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor

noverb:  for
passive: it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features

noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  apart from the nature of the investigation
active:  my friend had on hand
active:  there was something
noverb:  in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning
noverb:  made it a pleasure to me
active:  to study his system of work
active:  to follow the quick, subtle methods by
active:  he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries
noverb:  accustomed was I to his invariable success

active:  by doing
noverb:  I can't imagine
active:  I suppose
active:  you have been watching the habits
noverb:  perhaps the house
noverb:  of Miss Irene Adler
noverb:  Quite
active:  the sequel was rather unusual
active:  I will tell you
noverb:  however
noverb:  I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work
active:  There is a wonderful sympathy
noverb:  freemasonry among horsey men

noverb:  remarkable
active:  save
passive: the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house

noverb:  found
noverb:  as I expected
active:  there was a mews in a lane

noverb:  two fills of shag tobacco
noverb:  as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler
active:  to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
active:  I was not in the least interested
noverb:  biographies I was compelled
active:  to listen to
noverb:  And what of Irene Adler
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
active:  she has turned all the men's heads down in
noverb:  part

active:  When I had listened to all they had
active:  to tell

active:  to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once
active:  to think over my plan of campaign
active:  This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter
active:  He was a lawyer
active:  That sounded ominous
active:  was the relation between them
noverb:  the object of his repeated visits
noverb:  Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress
noverb:  the former
active:  she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping
noverb:  the latter
active:  it was less
noverb:  likely
novoice: On the issue of this question depended
active:  I should continue my work at Briony Lodge
noverb:  turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple
active:  It was a delicate point
active:  it widened the field of my inquiry
active:  I fear
active:  I bore you with these details
active:  I have
novoice: to let
active:  you see my little difficulties
active:  you are to understand the situation
active:  I am following you closely

active:  a gentleman sprang out
active:  He was a
noverb:  remarkably handsome man
noverb:  dark, aquiline

active:  he pulled a gold watch from his pocket
active:  looked at it earnestly
noverb:  Drive
noverb:  the devil
active:  he shouted
noverb:  first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street
noverb:  to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road
noverb:  Half a guinea
active:  you do it in twenty minutes
noverb:  Away they went

noverb:  ,
noverb:  his tie under his ear
active:  all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles

active:  I was just balancing
active:  I should run for
noverb:  it
active:  I should perch behind her landau
active:  a cab came through the street
active:  The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare
active:  I jumped in
active:  he could object
noverb:  The Church of St. Monica
active:  said I
noverb:  half a sovereign
active:  you reach it in twenty minutes
active:  It was twenty-five minutes to twelve
noverb:  of course
novoice: it was clear
noverb:  enough
active:  was in the wind

noverb:  I don't think I ever drove faster

noverb:  a surpliced clergyman

active:  done in an instant
active:  there was the gentleman
noverb:  thanking me on the one side
noverb:  the lady on the other
active:  the clergyman beamed on me in front
active:  It was the most preposterous position in
active:  I ever found myself in my life
active:  it was the thought of it
active:  started me laughing just now
active:  It seems
active:  there had been some informality about their license
novoice: the clergyman absolutely refused
active:  to marry them without a witness of some sort
active:  my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom
active:  having
active:  to sally out into the streets in search of a best man
noverb:  The bride gave me a sovereign
active:  I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
active:  This is a very unexpected turn of affairs
active:  said I
noverb:  and
noverb:  Well,

noverb:  By the way
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I shall want your co-operation
passive: I shall be delighted
noverb:  You don't mind breaking the law
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Nor running a chance of arrest
noverb:  Not in a good cause
noverb:  Oh
active:  the cause is excellent
active:  I am your man
active:  I was sure
active:  I might rely on
noverb:  you
active:  is it
active:  you wish
active:  When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray
active:  I will make it clear
noverb:  to you
noverb:  Now

noverb:  at the signal
active:  I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of
noverb:  Fire
active:  The word was no sooner out of my mouth
noverb:  the whole crowd of spectators
noverb:  well dressed
noverb:  ill
noverb:  gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids
passive: joined in a general shriek of
noverb:  Fire
active:  Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room
noverb:  out at the open window
active:  I caught a glimpse of rushing figures
noverb:  a moment later the voice of Holmes from
active:  assuring them
active:  it was a false alarm
passive: Slipping through the shouting crowd
active:  I made my way to the corner of the street
passive: in ten minutes was rejoiced
active:  to find my friend's arm in mine
active:  to get away from the scene of uproar
active:  He walked swiftly
noverb:  in silence for some few minutes
active:  we had turned down one of the quiet streets
active:  lead towards the Edgeware Road
active:  You did it very nicely
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  Nothing could
active:  have been better
active:  It is all
active:  right
active:  You have the photograph
active:  I know
active:  it is
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you find out
active:  She showed me
active:  I told you
active:  she would
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I do not wish to make a mystery
active:  said he
noverb:  laughing
active:  The matter was perfectly simple
noverb:  You, of course, saw
active:  everyone in the street was an accomplice
active:  They were all engaged for the evening
active:  I guessed as much
active:  the row broke out
active:  I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand
active:  I rushed forward
noverb:  fell down
active:  clapped my hand to my face
active:  became a piteous spectacle
active:  It is an old trick
active:  also I could fathom
active:  they carried me in
passive: She was bound
active:  to have me in
active:  else could
active:  she do
noverb:  And into her sitting-room
active:  was the very room
active:  I suspected
active:  It lay between
noverb:  her bedroom
passive: I was determined
active:  to see
active:  They laid me on a couch
active:  I motioned for air
passive: they were compelled
active:  to open the window
active:  you had your chance
active:  did
active:  help you
active:  It was all-important
active:  When a woman thinks
active:  her house is on fire
active:  her instinct is at once
active:  to rush to the thing
active:  she values
active:  It is a
noverb:  perfectly overpowering impulse
active:  I have more than once taken advantage of it
active:  In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me
noverb:  also in the Arnsworth Castle business
noverb:  A married woman grabs at her baby
noverb:  an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box
noverb:  Now
active:  it was clear
noverb:  to me
noverb:  our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
noverb:  to her
active:  we are in quest of
active:  She would rush to secure it
passive: The alarm of fire was admirably done
active:  The smoke and shouting were enough
active:  to shake nerves of steel
active:  She responded beautifully
active:  The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull
active:  She was there
noverb:  in an instant
active:  I caught a glimpse of it
active:  she half drew it out
novoice: When I cried out
active:  it was a false alarm
active:  she replaced it
novoice: glanced at the rocket
active:  rushed from the room
active:  I have not seen her
active:  I rose
active:  making my excuses
noverb:  escaped from the house
active:  I hesitated
active:  to attempt to secure the photograph at once
active:  the coachman had come in
active:  he was watching me narrowly
active:  it seemed safer
active:  to wait
noverb:  A little over-precipitance
active:  may ruin all
noverb:  And now
active:  I asked
passive: Our quest is practically finished
active:  I shall call with the King to-morrow
noverb:  with you
noverb:  you care
active:  to come with us
passive: We will be shown into the sitting-room
active:  to wait for the lady
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that
active:  she comes
active:  she may find
noverb:  us nor the photograph
active:  It might be a satisfaction
noverb:  to his Majesty
active:  to regain it with his own hands
active:  And when will you call
noverb:  At eight in the morning
active:  She will not be up
active:  we shall have a clear field
noverb:  Besides
active:  we must be prompt
noverb:  , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits
active:  I must wire to the King without delay
active:  We had reached Baker Street
active:  had stopped at the door
active:  He was searching his pockets for the key
active:  someone passing said
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Mister Sherlock Holmes
active:  There were several people on the pavement at the time
novoice: the greeting appeared
active:  to come from a slim youth in an ulster
active:  had hurried by
noverb:  I've heard
noverb:  voice before
active:  said Holmes
active:  staring down the dimly lit street
noverb:  Now,
active:  I wonder
noverb:  the deuce
active:  could
passive: have been
noverb:  III.
active:  I slept at Baker Street that night
passive: we were engaged upon our toast
noverb:  coffee in the morning
active:  the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
active:  You have really got it
active:  he cried
noverb:  grasping Sherlock Holmes by
noverb:  shoulder
noverb:  looking eagerly into his face
noverb:  Not
active:  you have hopes
active:  I have hopes
active:  come
active:  I am all impatience
passive: to be gone
active:  We must have a cab
noverb:  No
active:  my brougham is waiting
active:  that will simplify matters
active:  We descended and started off once
noverb:  for Briony Lodge
passive: Irene Adler is married
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Married
noverb:  When
noverb:  Yesterday
noverb:  to
active:  To an English lawyer named Norton
active:  she could not love him
active:  I am in hopes
active:  she does
noverb:  And
noverb:  in hopes
active:  it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance
active:  the lady loves her husband
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  she does not love your Majesty
active:  there is no reason
noverb:  why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan
active:  It is true
noverb:  And
noverb:  ! Well
active:  I wish she
passive: had been of my own station
noverb:  a queen
active:  she would have made
active:  He relapsed into a moody silence
passive: was not broken
active:  we drew up in Serpentine Avenue
active:  The door of Briony Lodge was open
active:  an elderly woman stood upon the steps
active:  She watched us with a sardonic eye
active:  we stepped from the brougham
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  I believe
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  I am Mr. Holmes
active:  answered my companion
active:  looking at her with a questioning
noverb:  rather startled gaze
noverb:  Indeed
active:  My mistress told me
active:  you were likely
active:  to call
active:  She left this morning with her husband by the 5
noverb:  15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent
active:  Sherlock Holmes staggered back
noverb:  white with chagrin and surprise
active:  Do you mean
active:  she has left England
noverb:  Never
active:  to return
noverb:  And the papers
active:  asked the King hoarsely
noverb:  All is lost
active:  We shall see
active:  He pushed past the servant
novoice: rushed into the drawing-room
passive: followed by the King and myself
passive: The furniture was scattered about in every direction
noverb:  with dismantled shelves
noverb:  open drawers
noverb:  as
active:  the lady had hurriedly ransacked them
noverb:  her flight
active:  Holmes rushed at the bell-pull
noverb:  tore back a small sliding shutter
active:  plunging in his hand
novoice: pulled out a photograph and a letter
active:  The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress
passive: the letter was superscribed to
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
passive: Esq. To be left till called for
noverb:  My friend tore it open
noverb:  we all three read it together
passive: It was dated at midnight of the preceding night
active:  ran in this way
noverb:  MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
active:  You really did it very well
active:  You took me in completely
noverb:  Until after the alarm of fire
active:  I had not a suspicion
active:  I found
active:  I had betrayed myself
active:  I began
active:  to think
passive: I had been warned against
noverb:  you months ago
passive: I had been told
active:  the King employed an agent
active:  it would certainly be you
active:  And your address had been given me
noverb:  Yet,
noverb:  with all this
noverb:  you made me reveal
active:  you wanted
active:  to know
noverb:  Even
active:  I became suspicious
active:  I found it hard
active:  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman
active:  you know
active:  I have been trained as an actress myself
active:  Male costume is nothing new to me
active:  I often take advantage of the freedom
active:  it gives
active:  I sent John, the coachman,
active:  to watch you
active:  ran upstairs
active:  got into my walking clothes
active:  I call them
active:  came down just as you
active:  departed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I followed you to your door
noverb:  made sure
active:  I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Then I
noverb:  rather imprudently
active:  wished you good-night
novoice: started for the Temple
active:  to see my husband
noverb:  We
novoice: thought
active:  the best resource was flight
novoice: pursued by so formidable an antagonist
active:  you will find the nest empty
noverb:  you call to-morrow
noverb:  As to the photograph
active:  your client may rest in peace
active:  I love and am loved by a better man
noverb:  he
active:  The King may do
active:  he will without hindrance from one
active:  he has cruelly wronged
active:  I keep it only
active:  to safeguard myself
active:  to preserve a weapon
active:  will always secure me from any steps
active:  he might take in the future
active:  I leave a photograph
active:  he might care
active:  to possess
active:  and I remain
noverb:  dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  Very truly yours
noverb:  IRENE NORTON
noverb:  nee ADLER
noverb:  a woman
noverb:  oh
noverb:  a woman
active:  cried the King of Bohemia
noverb:  we had all three read this epistle
active:  Did I not tell you
noverb:  quick
noverb:  resolute she was
active:  Would
active:  she not have made an admirable queen
noverb:  Is it not a pity
active:  she was not on my level
noverb:  From
active:  I have seen of the lady
active:  she seems, indeed,
active:  to be on a very different level to your Majesty
active:  said Holmes coldly
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that I have not been able
active:  to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  cried the King
active:  nothing could be more successful
active:  I know
active:  her word is inviolate
active:  The photograph is now
active:  it were in the fire
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear your Majesty
active:  say
active:  I am immensely indebted
noverb:  to you
active:  Pray
active:  tell me in
noverb:  way I can reward you
noverb:  This ring
active:  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger
active:  held it out upon the palm of his hand
active:  Your Majesty has something
active:  I should value even
noverb:  highly
active:  said Holmes
active:  You have
active:  to name it
noverb:  This photograph
active:  The King stared at him in amazement
noverb:  Irene's photograph
active:  he cried
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  you wish it
active:  I thank your Majesty
active:  there is no
noverb:  more
passive: to be done in the matter
active:  I have the honour
active:  to wish you a very good morning
active:  He bowed
noverb:  turning away
active:  observing the hand
active:  the King had stretched out to him
active:  he set off in my company for his chambers
noverb:  And
active:  was
novoice: a great scandal threatened
active:  to affect the kingdom of Bohemia
active:  the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit
active:  He used to make merry over the cleverness of women
noverb:  I have not heard him do it of late
active:  And when he speaks of Irene Adler
active:  he refers to her photograph
active:  it is always under the honourable title of the woman
noverb:  ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  I had called upon my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  one day in the autumn of last year
active:  found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
noverb:  With an apology for my intrusion
active:  I was about
active:  to withdraw
active:  Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room
active:  closed the door behind me
active:  You could not possibly have come at a better time
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  he said cordially
active:  I was afraid
noverb:  that you were engaged
active:  I am
noverb:  Very much
active:  I can wait in the next room
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  This gentleman, Mr. Wilson
active:  has been my partner
noverb:  helper in many of my most successful cases
active:  I have no doubt
active:  he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
active:  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair
active:  gave a bob of greeting
noverb:  with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
active:  Try the settee
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  relapsing into his armchair
active:  putting his fingertips together
active:  was his custom
noverb:  in judicial moods
active:  I know
noverb:  my dear Watson
active:  you share my love of all
active:  is bizarre
noverb:  outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life
active:  You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm
active:  has prompted you
active:  to chronicle
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  somewhat
active:  to embellish so many of my own little adventures
active:  Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
active:  I observed
active:  You will remember
active:  I remarked the other day
noverb:  just
active:  we went
passive: into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  for strange effects
noverb:  extraordinary combinations
active:  we must go to life itself
active:  is always far more daring
noverb:  any effort of the imagination
noverb:  A proposition
active:  I took the liberty of doubting
active:  You did
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  none the
active:  you must come round to my view
noverb:  for
active:  I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason
active:  breaks down under them
active:  acknowledges me
active:  to be right
noverb:  Now,
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough
active:  to call upon me this morning
active:  to begin a narrative
active:  promises to be one of the most singular
active:  I have listened to for some time
noverb:  You have heard me remark
noverb:  the strangest
active:  most unique things are very often connected not with the larger
noverb:  with the smaller crimes
noverb:  occasionally, indeed,
active:  there is room for doubt
passive: any positive crime has been committed
active:  I have heard
active:  it is impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
active:  the present case is an instance of crime
noverb:  not
active:  the course of events is certainly among the most singular
active:  I have ever listened to
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to recommence your narrative
active:  I ask you not merely
active:  my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part
noverb:  also
active:  the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious
active:  to have every possible detail from your lips
noverb:  As a rule
active:  I have heard some slight indication of the course of events
active:  I am able
active:  to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases
active:  occur to my memory
passive: In the present instance I am forced
active:  to admit
active:  the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique
active:  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride
active:  pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat
active:  he glanced down the advertisement column
noverb:  with his head thrust forward
novoice: the paper flattened out upon his knee
active:  I took a good look at the man
active:  endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion,
active:  to read the indications
passive: might be presented by his dress or appearance
active:  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection
active:  Our visitor bore every mark
active:  being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous
noverb:  slow
active:  He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers
noverb:  a not over-clean black frock-coat
noverb:  , unbuttoned in the front
noverb:  a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain
active:  a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament
noverb:  A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
noverb:  Altogether,
noverb:  look as I would
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  remarkable about the man save his blazing red head
noverb:  the expression of extreme chagrin
noverb:  discontent upon his features
active:  Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation
active:  he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
noverb:  Beyond the obvious facts
active:  he has at some time done manual labour
active:  he takes snuff
active:  he is a Freemason
active:  he has been in China
active:  he has done a considerable amount of writing lately
active:  I can deduce nothing else
novoice: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair
noverb:  with his forefinger upon the paper
noverb:  his eyes upon my companion
noverb:  , in the name of good-fortune, did you know all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  he asked
active:  did you know, for example,
active:  I did manual labour
active:  It's
noverb:  gospel
noverb:  for I began as a ship's carpenter
noverb:  Your hands
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  Your right hand is quite a size larger
noverb:  than your left
active:  You have worked with
noverb:  it
active:  the muscles are more developed
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the snuff
noverb:  the Freemasonry
noverb:  I won't insult your intelligence
active:  telling you
active:  I read
noverb:  especially as
noverb:  rather against the strict rules of your order
active:  you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
noverb:  Ah, of course, I forgot that
noverb:  the writing
passive: else can be indicated by
noverb:  right cuff
noverb:  very shiny for five inches
noverb:  the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow
active:  you rest it upon the desk
noverb:  Well
noverb:  China
noverb:  The fish
active:  you have tattooed
passive: immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China
active:  I have made a small study of tattoo marks
active:  have even contributed to the literature of the subject
noverb:  That trick
active:  staining
active:  the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
active:  When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain
active:  the matter becomes even more simple
active:  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I never
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I thought at first
active:  you had done something clever
active:  I see
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in it after all
active:  I begin
active:  to think
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  I make a mistake
active:  explaining
noverb:  Omne ignotum pro magnifico
active:  you know
noverb:  my poor little reputation
active:  such as it is
active:  will suffer shipwreck
active:  I am so candid
active:  Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have got it now
active:  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column
noverb:  Here it is
active:  This is
active:  began it all
active:  You just read it for yourself, sir
active:  I took the paper from him
active:  read
noverb:  as follows
noverb:  TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
noverb:  On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
active:  there is now another

noverb:  at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League
noverb:  7 Pope's Court
noverb:  Fleet Street
active:  on earth does this mean
active:  I ejaculated
active:  I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
novoice: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair
active:  was his habit
noverb:  in high spirits
active:  It is a little off the beaten track
noverb:  isn't it
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  off you go at scratch
active:  tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect
active:  this advertisement had upon your fortunes
active:  You will first make a note, Doctor
noverb:  of the paper and the date
active:  It is The Morning Chronicle
noverb:  of April 27
noverb:  1890
noverb:  Just two months ago
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is just
active:  I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said Jabez Wilson
active:  mopping his forehead
active:  I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square
noverb:  near the City
active:  It's not a very large affair
noverb:  of late years it has not done
noverb:  more than just give me a living
active:  I used to be able
active:  to keep two assistants
active:  now I only keep one
active:  and I would have a job
active:  to pay him
active:  he is willing
active:  to come for half wages
active:  to learn the business
active:  is the name of this obliging youth
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
active:  His name is Vincent Spaulding
active:  he's not such a youth
active:  It's hard
active:  to say his age
active:  I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes
active:  and I know very well
active:  he could better himself
active:  earn twice
active:  I am able
active:  to give him
noverb:  , after all,
passive: he is satisfied
active:  should I put ideas in his head
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem most fortunate
active:  having an employe
active:  comes under the full market price
active:  It is not a common experience among employers in this age
noverb:  I don't know
active:  your assistant is not
noverb:  your advertisement
noverb:  Oh
active:  he has his faults
noverb:  too
active:  said Mr. Wilson
active:  Never was such a fellow for photography
noverb:  Snapping away with a camera
active:  he ought to be improving his mind
noverb:  diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
active:  to develop his pictures
active:  That is his main fault
noverb:  on the whole
active:  he's a good worker
active:  There's no vice in him
active:  He is still with you
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  He and a girl of fourteen
active:  does a bit of simple cooking
active:  keeps the place clean
active:  that's all I have in the house
noverb:  for
active:  I am a widower
active:  never had any family
active:  We live very quietly
noverb:  sir
noverb:  the three of us
active:  and we keep a roof over our heads
active:  pay our debts
active:  we do nothing
noverb:  The first thing
novoice: put us
active:  was that advertisement
noverb:  Spaulding
active:  he came down into the office just this day eight weeks
noverb:  with this very paper in his hand
active:  he says
active:  I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson
active:  I was a red-headed man
noverb:  that
active:  I asks
active:  says he
noverb:  here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  It's worth quite a little fortune to any man
active:  gets it
active:  I understand
active:  there are more vacancies
active:  there are men
noverb:  ,
active:  the trustees are at their wits' end
active:  to do with the money
active:  my hair would only change colour
noverb:  here's a nice little crib all ready for me
active:  to step into
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I am a very stay-at-home man
active:  my business came to me instead of my having
active:  to go to it
active:  I was often weeks
noverb:  on end
active:  putting my foot over the door-mat
noverb:  In
noverb:  way I didn't know much of
active:  was going on
active:  I was always glad
noverb:  of a bit of news
active:  Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men
active:  he asked
active:  with his eyes open
noverb:  Never
active:  I wonder at
noverb:  for
active:  you are eligible
noverb:  yourself for one of the vacancies
noverb:  And
noverb:  are they worth
active:  I asked
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  merely a couple of hundred a year
active:  the work is slight
noverb:  it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can easily think
noverb:  made me prick up my ears
novoice: for the business has not been over good for some years
active:  an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
active:  Tell me all about it
active:  said I.
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  showing me the advertisement
active:  you can see for yourself
active:  the League has a vacancy
active:  there is the address
noverb:  where you should apply for particulars
active:  I can make out
passive: the League was founded by an American millionaire
noverb:  Ezekiah Hopkins
noverb:  who was very peculiar
noverb:  in his ways
active:  He was himself red-headed
active:  he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
active:  he died
passive: it was found
active:  he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees
noverb:  with instructions
active:  to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men
active:  hair is of
noverb:  colour
noverb:  From all I hear
active:  it is splendid pay
noverb:  very little
active:  to do
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  there would be millions of red-headed men
active:  would apply
noverb:  Not
active:  you might think
active:  he answered
active:  You see
passive: it is really confined to Londoners
noverb:  to grown men
active:  This American had started from London
active:  he was young
noverb:  ,
noverb:  he wanted to do the old town a good turn
active:  , again, I have heard
active:  it is no use
active:  your applying
active:  your hair is light red
noverb:  dark red
noverb:  anything
noverb:  real bright
noverb:  blazing
noverb:  fiery red
noverb:  Now,
active:  you cared to apply
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  you would just walk in
active:  perhaps it would hardly be worth your
noverb:  to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  it is a fact, gentlemen, as you
active:  may see for yourselves
active:  my hair is of a very full and rich tint
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  there was to be any competition in the matter
active:  I stood as good a chance as any man
active:  I had ever met
active:  Vincent Spaulding seemed
active:  to know
noverb:  much about it
active:  I thought
active:  he might prove useful
active:  I just ordered him
active:  to put up the shutters for the day
active:  to come right away with me
active:  He was very willing
active:  to have a holiday
active:  we shut the business up
novoice: started off for the address
active:  was given us in the advertisement
active:  I never hope to see such a sight as
noverb:  again
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  From north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west every man
active:  had a shade of red in his hair
active:  had tramped into the city
active:  to answer the advertisement
passive: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk
active:  Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow
active:  I should not have thought
active:  there were so many
noverb:  in the whole country
passive: were brought together by
noverb:  single advertisement
noverb:  Every shade of colour they were
noverb:  straw
noverb:  lemon
noverb:  orange
noverb:  brick
noverb:  Irish-setter
noverb:  liver
noverb:  clay
active:  Spaulding said
active:  , there were not many
noverb:  who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint
active:  When I saw
noverb:  many were waiting
active:  I would have given it up in despair
active:  Spaulding would not hear of
noverb:  it
active:  he did it
active:  I could not imagine
active:  he pushed and pulled
novoice: butted
active:  he got me through the crowd
noverb:  right up to the steps
active:  led to the office
active:  There was a double stream upon the stair
noverb:  some going up in hope
noverb:  some coming back dejected
active:  we wedged in
active:  we could
active:  soon found ourselves in the office
active:  Your experience has been a most entertaining one
active:  remarked Holmes
novoice: his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff
active:  Pray
active:  continue your very interesting statement
active:  There was nothing
noverb:  in the office
noverb:  a couple of wooden chairs
noverb:  a deal table
noverb:  behind
active:  sat a small man with a head
active:  was even redder
noverb:  mine
active:  He said a few words to each candidate
active:  he came up
novoice: he always managed
active:  to find some fault in them
active:  would disqualify them
active:  Getting a vacancy
active:  did not seem to be such a very easy matter
noverb:  after all
noverb:  However,
active:  our turn came
active:  the little man was much more favourable to me
noverb:  to any of the others
active:  he closed the door
active:  we entered
active:  he might have a private word with us
active:  This is Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  said
noverb:  my assistant
active:  he is willing
active:  to fill a vacancy in the League
passive: And he is admirably suited for
noverb:  it
active:  the other answered
active:  He has every requirement
active:  I cannot recall
active:  I have seen anything
noverb:  fine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  cocked his head on one side
novoice: gazed at my hair
active:  I felt quite bashful
active:  suddenly he plunged forward
active:  wrung my hand
active:  congratulated me warmly on my success
active:  It would be injustice
active:  to hesitate
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  You will, however,
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , excuse me
active:  taking an obvious precaution
noverb:  With
active:  he seized my hair in
noverb:  his hands
novoice: tugged
active:  I yelled with the pain
active:  There is water in your eyes
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  he released me
active:  I perceive
noverb:  all is
active:  as it should be
active:  we have
active:  to be careful
noverb:  for we have twice been deceived by wigs
noverb:  once by paint
noverb:  I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax
active:  would disgust you with human nature
active:  He stepped over to the window
active:  shouted through it at the top of his voice
passive: the vacancy was filled
active:  A groan of disappointment came up from below
noverb:  the folk all trooped
active:  away in different directions until there was not a red-head
passive: to be seen
noverb:  my own
noverb:  of the manager
noverb:  My name
active:  said he
active:  is Mr. Duncan Ross
active:  I am myself
passive: one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor
noverb:  Are you a married man
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  Have you a family
active:  I answered
active:  I had not
noverb:  His face fell immediately
noverb:  Dear me
active:  he said gravely
active:  that is very serious indeed
active:  I am sorry
active:  to hear
active:  you say that
active:  The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads
noverb:  for their maintenance
active:  It is exceedingly unfortunate
noverb:  that you should be a bachelor
novoice: My face lengthened at this
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  for I thought
active:  I was not to have the vacancy after all
noverb:  after thinking it over for a few minutes he said
active:  it would be all
active:  right
noverb:  In the case of another
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the objection might be fatal
active:  we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours
passive: When shall
active:  you be able
active:  to enter upon your new duties
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a little awkward
noverb:  , for I have a business already
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
active:  never mind about
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  said Vincent Spaulding
active:  I should be able
active:  to look after
noverb:  for you
active:  would be the hours
active:  I asked
noverb:  Ten to two
passive: Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  especially Thursday
noverb:  Friday evening
active:  is just
noverb:  pay-day;
active:  it would suit me very well
active:  to earn a little in the mornings
noverb:  Besides
active:  I knew
active:  my assistant was a good man
active:  he would see to anything
active:  turned up
active:  That would suit me very well
noverb:  said I. 'And the pay
active:  Is $4 a week
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is purely nominal
active:  do you call purely nominal
noverb:  Well,
active:  you have
active:  to be in the office
noverb:  at least in the building, the whole time
noverb:  you leave
noverb:  you forfeit your whole position forever
active:  The will is very clear upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  You don't comply with the conditions
active:  you budge from the office during
noverb:  time
active:  It's only four hours a day
active:  I should not think of leaving
active:  said I.
active:  No excuse will avail
active:  said Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  neither sickness
noverb:  business
noverb:  anything else
noverb:  There
active:  you must stay
active:  you lose your billet
noverb:  And the work
active:  Is
active:  to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  There is the first volume
noverb:  of it in
noverb:  press
active:  You must find your own ink, pens
noverb:  blotting-paper
active:  we provide this table and chair
active:  Will
novoice: you be ready
noverb:  to-morrow?
noverb:  Certainly,
active:  I answered
noverb:  good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson
noverb:  let me congratulate you once
noverb:  on the important position
active:  you have been fortunate enough
active:  to gain
noverb:  He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
noverb:  hardly knowing
active:  to say or do
active:  I was so pleased
noverb:  at my own good fortune
noverb:  Well,
active:  I thought over the matter all day
active:  evening
active:  I was in low spirits again
noverb:  for I had quite persuaded myself
active:  the whole affair must be some great hoax
noverb:  fraud
active:  its object might be
active:  I could not imagine
noverb:  It seemed altogether past belief
active:  anyone could make such a will
active:  they would pay such a sum
active:  doing anything
noverb:  simple
active:  copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica
active:  Vincent Spaulding did
active:  he could to cheer me up
noverb:  by bedtime
active:  I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing
noverb:  However,
noverb:  in the morning
active:  I determined to have a look at it anyhow
active:  I bought a penny bottle of ink
noverb:  with a quill-pen
noverb:  seven sheets of foolscap paper
active:  I started off for Pope's Court
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  to my surprise
noverb:  delight
active:  everything was
noverb:  possible
active:  The table was set out ready for me
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was there
active:  to see
active:  I got fairly
active:  to work
active:  He started me off upon the letter A
active:  he left me
active:  he would drop in from time to time
active:  to see
noverb:  all was right with me
noverb:  At two o'clock he bade me good-day
active:  complimented me upon the amount
active:  I had written
active:  locked the door of the office after me
active:  This went on day after day
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  on Saturday the manager came in
novoice: planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work
active:  It was the same next week
noverb:  the same the week after
noverb:  Every morning
active:  I was there
noverb:  at ten
noverb:  every afternoon
active:  I left at two
active:  By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took
active:  to coming in only once of a morning
active:  , after a time, he did not come in at all
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  I never dared
active:  to leave the room for an instant
noverb:  for I was not sure
active:  he might come
noverb:  the billet was such a good one
active:  suited me
noverb:  well
active:  I would not risk the loss of it
active:  Eight weeks passed away
noverb:  this
active:  I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour
noverb:  Architecture
noverb:  Attica
novoice: hoped with diligence
active:  I might get on to the B's
noverb:  very long
noverb:  It cost me something in foolscap
noverb:  I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings
active:  And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
noverb:  To an end
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And no later
noverb:  this morning
active:  I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock
active:  the door was shut and locked
novoice: with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack
noverb:  Here it is
active:  you can read for yourself
active:  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
active:  It read in this fashion
noverb:  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
active:  IS
noverb:  DISSOLVED
noverb:  October 9
noverb:  1890
active:  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement
noverb:  the rueful face behind it
noverb:  until the comical side of the affair
active:  completely overtopped every other consideration
noverb:  we
novoice: burst out into a roar of laughter
active:  I cannot see
active:  there is anything
noverb:  very funny
active:  cried our client
active:  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
active:  you can do nothing better
noverb:  than laugh at me
active:  I can go elsewhere
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  shoving him back into the chair from
active:  he had half risen
noverb:  I really wouldn't miss your case for the world
active:  It is most refreshingly unusual
active:  there is
active:  you will excuse my saying
noverb:  something just a little funny about it
active:  Pray
noverb:  steps did you take
active:  you found the card upon the door
passive: I was staggered
noverb:  sir
active:  I did not know
active:  to do
novoice: Then I called at the offices round
active:  none of them seemed to know anything about it
noverb:  Finally,
active:  I went to the landlord
noverb:  who is an accountant living on the ground floor
active:  I asked him
active:  he could tell me
active:  had become of the Red-headed League
active:  He said
active:  he had never heard of any such body
active:  Then I asked him
active:  Mr. Duncan Ross was
active:  He answered
active:  the name was new to him
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  the gentleman at No
noverb:  4
noverb:  the red-headed man
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Oh
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  his name was William Morris
active:  He was a solicitor
active:  was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
active:  were ready
active:  He moved out yesterday
active:  Where could I find him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  at his new offices
noverb:  He did tell me the address
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  17 King Edward Street
noverb:  near St. Paul's
active:  I started off
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got to
active:  address
active:  it was a manufactory
noverb:  of artificial knee-caps
active:  no one in it had ever heard of
noverb:  Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross
noverb:  And
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  asked Holmes
active:  I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I took the advice of my assistant
active:  he could not help me in any way
active:  He could only say
active:  I waited
active:  I should hear by post
active:  was not quite good enough
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle
active:  I had heard
active:  you were good enough
active:  to give advice to poor folk
active:  were in need of it
active:  I came right away to you
active:  And you did very wisely
active:  said Holmes
active:  Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to look into
noverb:  it
noverb:  From
active:  you have told me
active:  I think
active:  it is possible
noverb:  that graver issues hang from it
active:  might at first sight appear
noverb:  Grave enough
active:  said Mr. Jabez Wilson
active:  I have lost four pound a week
passive: you are personally concerned
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I do not see
active:  you have any grievance against this extraordinary league
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  you are
active:  I understand
noverb:  richer by some $30
active:  to say nothing of the minute knowledge
active:  you have gained on every subject
active:  comes
active:  under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  But I want
active:  to find out about them
active:  they are
active:  their object was
active:  playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me
noverb:  It was a pretty expensive joke for them
noverb:  for it cost them two
noverb:  thirty pounds
active:  We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  one or two questions
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
noverb:  This assistant of yours
active:  first called your attention to the advertisement
noverb:  long had
novoice: he been with
noverb:  you
noverb:  About a month
active:  did he come
noverb:  In answer to an advertisement
noverb:  Was he the only applicant
noverb:  No
active:  I had a dozen
active:  did you pick him
active:  he was handy
noverb:  and would come cheap
noverb:  At half wages
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  is he
noverb:  this Vincent Spaulding
noverb:  Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways
noverb:  no hair on his face
active:  he's not short of thirty
active:  Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
active:  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement
active:  I thought as much
active:  said he
active:  Have you
noverb:  observed
passive: his ears are pierced for earrings
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  He told me
active:  a gipsy had done it for him
active:  he was a lad
noverb:  Hum
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  sinking back in deep thought
active:  He is still with you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I have only just left him
active:  And has your business
passive: been attended to in your absence
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
noverb:  sir
active:  There's never very much
active:  to do of a morning
active:  That will do
noverb:  Mr. Wilson
active:  I shall be happy
noverb:  to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two
active:  To-day is Saturday
active:  I hope
active:  by Monday we may come to a conclusion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
active:  our visitor had left us
noverb:  do you make of it all
active:  I make nothing of it
active:  I answered frankly
active:  It is a most mysterious business
noverb:  As a rule
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves
active:  to be
active:  It is your commonplace
noverb:  , featureless crimes
active:  are really puzzling
noverb:  just
active:  a commonplace face is the most difficult
active:  to identify
active:  But I must be prompt over this matter
active:  are you going to do
active:  I asked
active:  To smoke
active:  he answered
active:  It is quite a three pipe problem
active:  I beg
noverb:  you won't speak to me for fifty minutes
active:  He curled himself up in his chair
active:  with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose
noverb:  there
novoice: he sat with his eyes closed
noverb:  his black clay pipe thrusting out
noverb:  the bill of some strange bird
active:  I had come to the conclusion
active:  he had dropped asleep
active:  indeed was nodding myself
active:  he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man
active:  has made up his mind
active:  put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
noverb:  Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon
active:  he remarked
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Watson
active:  Could your patients spare you for a few hours
active:  I have nothing
active:  to do to-day
active:  My practice is never very absorbing
noverb:  put on your hat
active:  come
active:  I am going through the City first
active:  we can have some lunch on the way
active:  I observe
active:  there is a good deal of German music on the programme
active:  is rather
noverb:  to my taste
noverb:  Italian
noverb:  French
active:  It is introspective
noverb:  ,
active:  I want
active:  to introspect
active:  Come along
active:  We travelled by the Underground
noverb:  Aldersgate
active:  and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the scene of the singular story
active:  we had listened to in the morning
active:  It was a poky
noverb:  little
noverb:  shabby-genteel place
novoice: four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure
active:  a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere
noverb:  Three gilt balls
noverb:  a brown board with
noverb:  JABEZ WILSON
noverb:  in white letters
noverb:  upon a corner house
active:  announced the place
active:  our red-headed client carried on his business
active:  Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
active:  looked it all over
active:  with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids
active:  he walked slowly up the street
noverb:  down again to the corner
noverb:  still looking keenly at the houses
active:  Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's
active:  having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times
active:  he went up to the door
novoice: knocked
active:  It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow
active:  asked him
active:  to step in
active:  Thank you
active:  said Holmes
active:  I only wished
active:  to ask you
active:  you would go from here to the Strand
noverb:  Third right
noverb:  fourth left
active:  answered the assistant promptly
active:  closing the door
noverb:  Smart fellow
noverb:  that
active:  observed Holmes
active:  we walked away
active:  He is, in my judgment, the
noverb:  fourth smartest man in London
active:  daring
active:  I am not sure
active:  he has not a claim
active:  to be third
active:  I have known something of him before
noverb:  Evidently
active:  said I
noverb:  Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League
active:  I am sure
active:  you inquired your way merely in order
active:  you might see him
noverb:  Not him
noverb:  The knees of his trousers
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you see
active:  I expected
active:  to see
active:  did you beat the pavement
noverb:  My dear doctor
active:  this is a time for observation
noverb:  not for talk
novoice: We are spies in an enemy's country
active:  We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  Let us now explore the parts
active:  lie behind
noverb:  it
noverb:  The road in
noverb:  we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
novoice: presented as great a contrast to it
active:  the front of a picture does to the back
active:  It was one of the main arteries
active:  conveyed the traffic of the City to the north
noverb:  west
passive: The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward
noverb:  outward
active:  the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians
active:  It was difficult
active:  to realise
active:  we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
novoice: they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
active:  we had just quitted
noverb:  Let me see
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  standing at the corner
active:  glancing along the line
active:  I should like just to remember the order of the houses here
active:  It is a hobby
noverb:  of mine
active:  to have an exact knowledge of London
active:  There is Mortimer's
noverb:  , the tobacconist
noverb:  the little newspaper shop
noverb:  the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot
noverb:  That carries us right on to the other block
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  we've done our work
active:  it's time
active:  we had some play
noverb:  A sandwich and a cup of coffee
noverb:  off to violin-land
noverb:  all is sweetness
noverb:  delicacy
noverb:  harmony
active:  there are no red-headed clients
active:  to vex us with their conundrums
active:  My friend was an enthusiastic musician
noverb:  being himself not only a very capable performer
noverb:  a composer of no ordinary merit
noverb:  All the afternoon
active:  he sat
novoice: in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness
active:  gently waving his long
active:  thin fingers in time to the music
active:  his gently smiling face
active:  his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound
noverb:  Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent
active:  it was possible
active:  to conceive
noverb:  In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself
noverb:  his extreme exactness
novoice: astuteness represented
active:  I have often thought
noverb:  the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood
novoice: occasionally predominated in him
active:  The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor
active:  to devouring energy
noverb:  and,
active:  I knew well
active:  he was never
noverb:  truly formidable as
noverb:  for days on end
active:  he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions
active:  it was
active:  the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him
noverb:  his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition
noverb:  until those
noverb:  who were unacquainted
active:  with his methods would look askance at him as on a man
active:  knowledge was not
noverb:  of other mortals
active:  When I saw him
noverb:  afternoon
noverb:  enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt
active:  an evil time might be coming upon those
active:  he had set himself
active:  to hunt down
active:  You want to go home
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  Doctor
active:  he remarked
active:  we emerged
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would be as well
active:  And I have some business
active:  to do
active:  will take some hours
active:  This business at Coburg Square is serious
noverb:  serious
active:  A considerable crime is in contemplation
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  we shall be in time
active:  to stop it
active:  to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters
active:  I shall want your help to-night
noverb:  At
noverb:  time
active:  Ten will be early enough
active:  I shall be at Baker Street at ten
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Doctor
active:  there may be some little danger
noverb:  kindly put your army revolver in your pocket
active:  He waved his hand
noverb:  turned on his heel
novoice: disappeared in an instant among the crowd
active:  I trust
active:  I am not more dense
noverb:  than my neighbours
passive: I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes
active:  Here I had heard
active:  he had heard
active:  I had seen
active:  he had seen
noverb:  from his words
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that he saw clearly not only
active:  had happened
active:  was about
active:  to happen
passive: to me the whole business was still confused
noverb:  grotesque
active:  As I drove
novoice: home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all
noverb:  from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square
noverb:  the ominous words with
active:  he had parted from me
active:  was this nocturnal expedition
active:  should I go armed
noverb:  Where were we going
active:  were we
active:  to do
active:  I had the hint from Holmes
active:  this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man
noverb:  a man
active:  might play a deep game
active:  I tried to puzzle it out
active:  gave it up in despair
novoice: set the matter aside until night
active:  should bring an explanation
noverb:  It was a quarter-past nine
active:  I started from home
active:  made my way across the Park
noverb:  through Oxford Street to Baker Street
active:  Two hansoms were standing at the door
active:  I entered the passage
active:  I heard the sound of voices from above
active:  entering his room
active:  I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men
noverb:  one of
active:  I recognised as Peter Jones
noverb:  the official police agent
active:  the other was a long
noverb:  thin
noverb:  sad-faced man
noverb:  with a very shiny hat
noverb:  oppressively respectable frock-coat
noverb:  Ha
active:  Our party is complete
active:  said Holmes
active:  buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
noverb:  Watson
active:  I think
active:  you know Mr. Jones
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
noverb:  Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather
active:  is to be our companion in to-night's adventure
noverb:  We
active:  hunting in couples again
noverb:  Doctor
active:  you see
active:  said Jones in his consequential way
active:  Our friend here is a wonderful man
active:  starting a chase
noverb:  All he wants
active:  is an old dog
active:  to help him
active:  to do the running down
active:  I hope
active:  a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
active:  observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily
active:  You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes
noverb:  sir
active:  said the police agent loftily
active:  He has his own little methods
active:  are
noverb:  he won't mind my saying
noverb:  just a little too theoretical
noverb:  fantastic
active:  he has the makings of a detective in him
active:  It is not too much
active:  to say
noverb:  once
noverb:  twice
noverb:  as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct
noverb:  the official force
noverb:  Oh
active:  you say
noverb:  Mr. Jones
active:  it is all
active:  right
active:  said the stranger with deference
noverb:  Still,
active:  I confess
active:  I miss my rubber
active:  It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
active:  I have not had my rubber
active:  I think
active:  you will find
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  you will play for a higher stake to-night
active:  you have ever done yet
active:  the play will be more exciting
noverb:  For you
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  the stake will be some $30,000
noverb:  and for you
noverb:  Jones
active:  it will be the man
noverb:  upon
noverb:  you wish
active:  to lay your hands
noverb:  John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger
active:  He's a young man
noverb:  Mr. Merryweather
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  I would rather have my bracelets on him
noverb:  on any criminal in London
active:  He's a remarkable man
active:  is young John Clay
active:  His grandfather was a royal duke
noverb:  he himself has been to Eton and Oxford
active:  His brain is
noverb:  his fingers
active:  we meet signs of him at every turn
active:  we never know
noverb:  to find the man himself
active:  He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week
active:  be raising money
noverb:  to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next
noverb:  I've been on his track for years
active:  have never set eyes on him
active:  I hope
active:  I may have the pleasure
active:  introducing you to-night
noverb:  I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay
active:  I agree with
noverb:  you
active:  he is at the head of his profession
active:  It is past ten, however,
noverb:  quite time
active:  we started
noverb:  you two will take
active:  the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second
active:  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
noverb:  lay back in the cab humming the tunes
active:  he had heard in the afternoon
active:  We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
active:  we emerged into Farrington Street
active:  We are close there
noverb:  now
active:  my friend remarked
active:  This fellow Merryweather is a bank director
novoice: personally interested in the matter
active:  I thought it as well
active:  to have Jones with us also
active:  He is not a bad fellow
noverb:  an absolute imbecile in his profession
active:  He has one positive virtue
active:  He is
noverb:  a bulldog
noverb:  a lobster
active:  he gets his claws upon anyone
noverb:  Here we are
active:  they are waiting for us
active:  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in
active:  we had found ourselves in the morning
passive: Our cabs were dismissed
active:  following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather
active:  we passed down a narrow passage
noverb:  through a side door
active:  he opened for us
active:  Within there was a small corridor
active:  ended in a very massive iron gate
passive: This also was opened
active:  led down a flight of winding stone steps
active:  terminated at another formidable gate
active:  Mr. Merryweather stopped
active:  to light a lantern
active:  conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage
active:  opening a third door
noverb:  into a huge vault or cellar
passive: was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
active:  You are not very vulnerable
noverb:  from above
novoice: Holmes remarked as
active:  he held up the lantern
active:  gazed about him
noverb:  Nor from below
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  striking his stick upon the flags
active:  lined the floor
noverb:  dear me
active:  it sounds quite hollow
active:  he remarked
active:  looking up in surprise
active:  I must really ask you
active:  to be a little more quiet
active:  said Holmes severely
active:  You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition
active:  Might I beg
active:  you would have the goodness
active:  to sit down upon one of those boxes
noverb:  not
active:  to interfere
active:  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate
noverb:  with a very injured expression upon his face
active:  Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor
noverb:  with the lantern and a magnifying lens
active:  began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones
active:  A few seconds sufficed
active:  to satisfy him
noverb:  for he sprang to his feet again
active:  put his glass in his pocket
active:  We have at least an hour
noverb:  us
active:  he remarked
noverb:  for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
active:  is safely in bed
active:  they will not lose a minute
noverb:  for the sooner they do their work the longer time
active:  they will have for their escape
active:  We are at present
noverb:  Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks
active:  Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors
active:  he will explain to
noverb:  you
novoice: there are reasons
active:  the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
active:  It is our French gold
active:  whispered the director
active:  We have had several warnings
passive: an attempt might be made upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Your French gold
noverb:  Yes
active:  We had occasion some months ago
active:  to strengthen our resources
active:  borrowed for
noverb:  purpose 30
noverb:  000 napoleons from the Bank of France
active:  It has become known
active:  we have never had occasion
active:  to unpack the money
active:  it is still lying in our cellar
noverb:  The crate upon
active:  I sit contains 2
active:  000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil
active:  Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present
passive: is usually kept in a single branch office
active:  the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
active:  were very well justified
active:  observed Holmes
active:  And now it is time
noverb:  we arranged our little plans
active:  I expect
active:  within an hour matters will come to a head
noverb:  In the meantime Mr. Merryweather
active:  we must put the screen over
noverb:  dark lantern
active:  And sit in the dark
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  so
active:  I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket
active:  I thought
active:  we were a partie carree
active:  you might have your rubber after all
active:  But I see
active:  the enemy's preparations have gone so far
active:  we cannot risk the presence of a light
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first of all
active:  we must choose our positions
noverb:  These are daring men
active:  we shall take them at a disadvantage
noverb:  they may do us some harm
active:  we are careful
active:  I shall stand behind this crate
active:  do you conceal yourselves behind those
active:  I flash a light upon them
noverb:  close in swiftly
active:  they fire
noverb:  Watson
active:  have no compunction
active:  shooting them down
active:  I placed my revolver
novoice: cocked
noverb:  upon the top of the wooden case behind
active:  I crouched
active:  Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
active:  left us in pitch darkness
noverb:  such an absolute darkness
active:  I have never
noverb:  experienced
active:  The smell of hot metal remained to assure us
active:  the light was still there
noverb:  ready
active:  to flash out at a moment's notice
noverb:  To me
novoice: with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy
active:  there was something
active:  depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom
noverb:  in the cold dank air of the vault
active:  They have
noverb:  one retreat
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square
active:  I hope
active:  you have done
active:  I asked you, Jones
active:  I have an inspector
active:  two officers waiting at the front door
active:  we have stopped all the holes
noverb:  And now
active:  we must be silent
noverb:  and wait
noverb:  a time
active:  it seemed
active:  From comparing notes afterwards it was
noverb:  an hour
noverb:  a quarter
novoice: it appeared to me
active:  the night must have almost gone
active:  the dawn be breaking above us
active:  My limbs were weary and stiff
noverb:  for I feared to change my position
passive: yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension
active:  my hearing was so acute
active:  I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions
active:  I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin
active:  sighing note of the bank director
active:  From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor
active:  Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
noverb:  At first it was
noverb:  a lurid spark upon the stone pavement
novoice: it lengthened out
active:  it became a yellow line
noverb:  without any warning
noverb:  sound
novoice: a gash seemed
novoice: to open and a hand appeared
noverb:  a white
noverb:  almost womanly hand
noverb:  felt about in the centre of the little area of light
noverb:  For a minute
noverb:  more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor
passive: it was withdrawn
novoice: it appeared
noverb:  all was dark again
active:  save the single lurid spark
active:  marked a chink between the stones
active:  Its disappearance, however, was
noverb:  momentary
noverb:  With a rending
noverb:  tearing sound
novoice: one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side
active:  left a square
noverb:  gaping hole
noverb:  through
active:  streamed the light of a lantern
active:  Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face
active:  looked keenly about it
noverb:  with a hand on
noverb:  side of the aperture
active:  drew itself shoulder-high
noverb:  waist-high
novoice: until one knee rested upon the edge
active:  In another instant he stood at the side of the hole
active:  was hauling after him a companion
noverb:  lithe and small
noverb:  himself
noverb:  with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
active:  It's all clear
active:  he whispered
active:  Have you the chisel and the bags
noverb:  Great Scott
noverb:  Jump, Archie, jump
active:  I'll swing for
noverb:  it
active:  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out
active:  seized the intruder by the collar
active:  The other dived down the hole
active:  I heard the sound of rending cloth
active:  Jones clutched at his skirts
active:  The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
active:  Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist
active:  the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
active:  It's no use, John Clay
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  You have no chance at all
active:  I see
active:  the other answered with the utmost coolness
active:  I fancy
active:  my pal is all right
active:  I see
active:  you have got his coat-tails
noverb:  There are three men waiting for him at the door
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  You seem to have done the thing very completely
active:  I must compliment you
noverb:  And I you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  Your red-headed idea was very new and effective
active:  You'll see your pal again presently
active:  said Jones
active:  He's quicker
active:  climbing down holes
active:  I am
active:  Just hold out
active:  I fix the derbies
active:  I beg
active:  you will not touch me with your filthy hands
active:  remarked our prisoner
active:  the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
active:  You may not be aware
active:  I have royal blood in my veins
active:  Have the goodness, also,
active:  you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please
noverb:  All right
active:  said Jones with a stare and a snigger
noverb:  Well,
active:  would you
noverb:  sir
noverb:  march upstairs
active:  we can get a cab
active:  to carry your Highness to the police-station?
active:  That is better
active:  said John Clay serenely
active:  He made a sweeping bow to the three of us
novoice: walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said Mr. Merryweather
active:  we followed them from the cellar
active:  I do not know
active:  the bank can thank you
active:  repay you
active:  There is no doubt
noverb:  that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
active:  have ever come within my experience
active:  I have had one or two little scores of my own
active:  to settle with Mr. John Clay
active:  said Holmes
active:  I have been at some small expense over this matter
active:  I shall expect the bank
active:  to refund
noverb:  beyond
passive: I am amply repaid
active:  having had an experience
active:  is in many ways unique
active:  hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street
active:  it was perfectly obvious
noverb:  from the first
noverb:  the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League
noverb:  the copying of the Encyclopaedia
active:  must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day
active:  It was a curious way
active:  managing it
noverb:  , really,
active:  it would be difficult
active:  to suggest a better
active:  The method was no doubt
passive: suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair
active:  The $4 a week was a lure
active:  must draw him
active:  was it to them
active:  were playing for thousands
active:  They put in the advertisement
active:  one rogue has the temporary office
active:  the other rogue incites the man
active:  to apply for it
active:  together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
noverb:  From the time
active:  I heard
active:  of the assistant having come for half wages
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  he had some strong motive
active:  securing the situation
active:  could you guess
active:  the motive was
passive: Had
active:  there been women
noverb:  in the house
active:  I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue
active:  , however, was out of the question
noverb:  The man's business was a small one
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  in his house
active:  could account for such elaborate preparations
noverb:  such an expenditure
active:  they were at
active:  It must
active:  be something out of the house
active:  could it be
active:  I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography
noverb:  his trick
active:  vanishing into the cellar
noverb:  The cellar
active:  There was the end of this tangled clue
active:  Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant
active:  found
active:  I had
active:  to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London
active:  He was doing something in the cellar
noverb:  something
active:  took many hours a day for months on end
active:  could it be
noverb:  once
active:  I could think of nothing save
active:  he was running a tunnel to some other building
active:  So far I had got
active:  we went to visit the scene of action
active:  I surprised you
active:  beating upon the pavement with my stick
active:  I was ascertaining
novoice: the cellar stretched out in front
noverb:  behind
active:  It was not in front
active:  Then I rang the bell
active:  I hoped
active:  the assistant answered it
active:  We have had some skirmishes
active:  we had never set eyes upon each other before
active:  I hardly looked at his face
active:  His knees were
active:  I wished
active:  to see
noverb:  You must yourself have remarked
noverb:  worn
noverb:  wrinkled
noverb:  stained they were
noverb:  They spoke of those hours
active:  burrowing
active:  The only remaining point was
active:  they were burrowing for
active:  I walked round the corner
active:  saw the City
active:  Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises
active:  felt
active:  I had solved my problem
active:  When you drove home after the concert
active:  I called upon Scotland Yard
noverb:  upon the chairman of the bank directors
noverb:  with the result
active:  you have seen
noverb:  And
active:  could you tell
active:  they would make their attempt to-night
noverb:  ?
active:  I asked
noverb:  Well,
active:  they closed their League offices
active:  was a sign
active:  they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence
noverb:  in other words
active:  they had completed their tunnel
active:  it was essential
noverb:  that they should use it soon
passive: as it might be discovered
passive: the bullion might be removed
active:  Saturday would suit them better
noverb:  any other day
active:  as it would give them two days for their escape
active:  For all these reasons I expected them
active:  to come to-night
active:  You reasoned it out beautifully
active:  I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration
active:  It is so long
noverb:  a chain
noverb:  every link rings true
active:  It saved me from ennui
active:  he answered
noverb:  yawning
noverb:  Alas
active:  I already feel it closing in upon me
passive: My life is spent in one long effort
active:  to escape from the commonplaces of existence
active:  These little problems help me
active:  to do
noverb:  And
active:  you are a benefactor of the race
active:  said I.
active:  He shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  Well,
active:  perhaps, after all, it is of some little use
active:  he remarked
noverb:  L'homme c'est rien
noverb:  l'oeuvre c'est tout
active:  Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
noverb:  ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on
noverb:  side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street
active:  life is infinitely stranger
noverb:  anything
active:  the mind of man could invent
active:  We would not dare to conceive the things
active:  are really mere commonplaces of existence
active:  we could fly out of that window hand in hand
active:  hover over this great city
active:  gently remove the roofs
noverb:  peep in at the queer things
active:  are going on
noverb:  the strange coincidences
noverb:  the plannings
noverb:  the cross-purposes
noverb:  the wonderful chains of events
noverb:  working through generations
active:  leading to the most outre results
active:  it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
noverb:  foreseen conclusions most stale
noverb:  unprofitable
noverb:  And
active:  I am not convinced
noverb:  of it
active:  I answered
noverb:  The cases
active:  come to light
active:  in the papers are
active:  , as a rule, bald enough
noverb:  vulgar enough
active:  We have
active:  in our police reports realism
novoice: pushed to its extreme limits
active:  the result is
passive: it must be confessed
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  artistic
passive: A certain selection and discretion must be used
active:  producing a realistic effect
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  This is wanting in the police report
passive: more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate
noverb:  upon the details
active:  to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter
active:  Depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so unnatural as the commonplace
active:  I smiled and shook my head
noverb:  I can quite understand your thinking
active:  I said
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody
passive: is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
passive: you are brought in contact with all
active:  is strange and bizarre
noverb:  here
noverb:  --I picked up the morning paper from the ground--
noverb:  let us put it to a practical test
active:  Here is the first heading upon
active:  I come
noverb:  A husband's cruelty to his wife
active:  There is half a column of print
active:  I know without reading it
active:  it is all
noverb:  perfectly familiar to me
active:  There is, of course, the other woman
noverb:  the drink
noverb:  the push
noverb:  the blow
noverb:  the bruise
noverb:  the sympathetic sister or landlady
active:  The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
active:  said Holmes
active:  taking the paper
active:  glancing his eye down it
active:  This is the Dundas separation case
active:  it happens
passive: I was engaged
active:  clearing up some small points in connection with it
active:  The husband was a teetotaler
active:  there was no other woman
active:  the conduct complained
active:  was
active:  he had drifted into the habit
active:  winding up every meal
active:  taking out his false teeth
active:  hurling them at his wife
active:  you will allow
active:  is not an action likely
active:  to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller
active:  Take a pinch of snuff
noverb:  Doctor
active:  acknowledge
active:  I have scored over
noverb:  you in your example
active:  He held out his snuffbox of old gold
noverb:  with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid
active:  Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life
active:  I could not help
active:  commenting upon it
noverb:  Ah
active:  said he
active:  I forgot
active:  I had not seen you for some weeks
active:  It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
noverb:  And the ring
active:  I asked
active:  glancing at a remarkable brilliant
active:  sparkled upon his finger
active:  It was from the reigning family of Holland
noverb:  the matter in
active:  I served
active:  them was of such delicacy
active:  I cannot confide it even to you
active:  have been good enough
active:  to chronicle one or two of my little problems
active:  And have you any on hand just now
active:  I asked with interest
noverb:  Some ten
noverb:  twelve
noverb:  none
active:  present any feature of interest
active:  They are important
active:  you understand
novoice: being
active:  interesting
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  I have found
active:  it is usually in unimportant matters
active:  there is a field
noverb:  for the observation
noverb:  for the quick analysis of cause and effect
active:  gives the charm to an investigation
active:  The larger crimes are apt
active:  to be the simpler
noverb:  for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive
noverb:  In these cases
noverb:  save for one rather intricate matter
passive: has been referred to me from Marseilles
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  which presents any features of interest
active:  It is possible
noverb:  , however,
active:  I may have something
active:  better
active:  very many minutes are over
active:  for this is one of my clients
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  He had risen from his chair
active:  was standing
active:  between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street
noverb:  Looking over his shoulder
active:  I saw
noverb:  on the pavement opposite
active:  there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa
active:  round her neck
noverb:  a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat
passive: was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear
noverb:  From under this great panoply
active:  she peeped up in a nervous
noverb:  hesitating fashion at our windows
active:  her body oscillated backward and forward
novoice: her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  with a plunge
noverb:  as of the swimmer
active:  leaves the bank
active:  she hurried across the road
active:  we heard the sharp clang of the bell
active:  I have seen those symptoms before
active:  said Holmes
active:  throwing his cigarette into the fire
active:  Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur
active:  She would like advice
active:  is not sure
active:  the matter is not too delicate for communication
noverb:  And
noverb:  even here we may discriminate
passive: When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man
active:  she no longer oscillates
active:  the usual symptom is a broken bell wire
noverb:  Here we may take it
active:  there is a love matter
active:  the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
novoice: grieved
noverb:  here she comes in person
active:  to resolve our doubts
active:  he spoke
active:  there was a tap
noverb:  at the door
passive: the boy in buttons entered
active:  to announce Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  the lady
active:  herself loomed behind his small black figure
noverb:  a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat
active:  Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
active:  he was remarkable
noverb:  ,
active:  having closed the door
novoice: bowed her into an armchair
active:  he looked her over in the minute
noverb:  abstracted fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  Do you not find
active:  he said
noverb:  with your short sight
active:  it is a little
active:  trying
active:  to do so much typewriting
active:  I did at first
active:  she answered
active:  now I know
active:  the letters are without looking
active:  suddenly realising the full purport of his words
active:  she gave a violent start
active:  looked up
noverb:  with fear and astonishment upon her broad
noverb:  good-humoured face
noverb:  You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes
active:  she cried
noverb:  else
active:  could you know all that
noverb:  Never mind
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  it is my business
active:  to know things
active:  Perhaps I have trained myself
active:  to see
active:  others overlook
noverb:  not
active:  should you come to consult me
active:  I came to
noverb:  you
noverb:  sir
active:  I heard of
noverb:  you from Mrs. Etherege
active:  husband you found
noverb:  easy
noverb:  the police
active:  everyone had given him up for dead
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I wish
active:  you would do as much for me
noverb:  I'm not rich
active:  still I have a hundred a year in my own right
noverb:  besides the little
active:  I make by the machine
active:  I would give it all
active:  to know
active:  has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  did you come away to consult me in such a hurry
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  his eyes to the ceiling
active:  Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland
noverb:  Yes
active:  I did bang out of the house
active:  she said
active:  for it made me angry
active:  to see the easy way in
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  that is
noverb:  my father
active:  took it all
active:  He would not go to the police
active:  he would not go to
noverb:  you
noverb:  at last
noverb:  as he would do nothing
active:  kept
active:  saying
active:  there was no harm
passive: done
novoice: it made me mad
noverb:  I just on with my things
active:  came right away to you
noverb:  Your father
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  your stepfather, surely,
active:  the name is different
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  my stepfather
noverb:  I call him father
active:  it sounds funny, too, for
active:  he is only five years
noverb:  two months older
noverb:  than myself
active:  And your mother is alive
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  mother is alive and well
noverb:  I wasn't best pleased
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  she married again
noverb:  soon after father's death
noverb:  a man
noverb:  who was nearly fifteen years younger
noverb:  than herself
active:  Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road
active:  he left a tidy business behind him
novoice: mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman
active:  Mr. Windibank came
noverb:  he made her sell the business
noverb:  for
active:  he was very superior
noverb:  , being a traveller in wines
active:  They got $4700 for the goodwill
noverb:  interest
noverb:  wasn't near
active:  father could have got
active:  he had been alive
active:  I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient
noverb:  under this rambling
noverb:  inconsequential narrative
active:  , on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
noverb:  Your own little income
active:  he asked
active:  does it come out of the business
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  It is quite separate
noverb:  and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland
active:  It is in New Zealand stock
noverb:  paying 4 1/4 per cent
active:  Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount
active:  I can only touch the interest
active:  You interest me extremely
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  And
noverb:  you draw
noverb:  large a sum as a hundred a year
noverb:  with
active:  you earn into the bargain
noverb:  you no doubt travel a little
active:  indulge yourself in every way
active:  I believe
active:  a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60
active:  I could do with much less than
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you understand
active:  I live at home I don't wish
active:  to be a burden to them
active:  they have the use of the money just
active:  I am staying with them
noverb:  Of course
active:  that is only just for the time
active:  Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
noverb:  pays it over
active:  to mother
active:  I find
active:  I can do pretty well with
active:  I earn at typewriting
noverb:  It brings me twopence a sheet
active:  I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
active:  You have made your position very clear
noverb:  to me
active:  said Holmes
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  Dr. Watson
active:  you can speak
noverb:  myself
noverb:  Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face
active:  she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket
noverb:  I met him first at the gasfitters' ball
active:  she said
active:  They used to send father tickets
active:  he was alive
noverb:  ,
active:  afterwards they remembered us
active:  sent them
active:  to mother
active:  Mr. Windibank did not wish us
active:  to go
active:  He never did wish us
active:  to go anywhere
active:  He would get quite mad
active:  I wanted
active:  to join a Sunday-school treat
noverb:  this time
passive: I was set on going
active:  I would go
noverb:  for
active:  right had he
active:  to prevent
active:  He said
passive: the folk were not fit for us
active:  to know
noverb:  all father's friends were to be there
active:  And he said
active:  I had nothing
active:  fit
active:  to wear
active:  I had my purple plush
active:  I had never
noverb:  taken out of the drawer
noverb:  At last
active:  nothing else would do
active:  he went off to France upon the business of the firm
active:  we went
noverb:  mother
noverb:  I, with Mr. Hardy,
active:  used to be our foreman
active:  it was there
active:  I met Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I suppose
active:  said Holmes
active:  Mr. Windibank came back from France
active:  he was very annoyed
noverb:  at your having gone to the ball
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  well
active:  he was very good
noverb:  about it
active:  He laughed
active:  I remember
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  said
active:  there was no use
active:  denying anything to a woman
noverb:  for she would have her way
active:  I see
active:  at the gasfitters' ball
active:  you met
active:  I understand
active:  a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I met him
noverb:  night
active:  he called next day to ask
active:  we had got home all safe
noverb:  after
active:  we met him
active:  that is to say
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I met him twice for walks
active:  that father came back again
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any
noverb:  No
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know father didn't
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  He wouldn't have any visitors
active:  he could help it
active:  he used to say
active:  a woman should be happy in her own family circle
noverb:  as I used
active:  to say
active:  to mother
active:  a woman wants her own circle
active:  to begin with
active:  I had not got mine
noverb:  about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Did he make no attempt
active:  to see you
noverb:  Well,
active:  father was going off to France again in a week
active:  Hosmer wrote and said
noverb:  that it would be safer and better not
active:  to see each other
active:  he had gone
active:  We could write in the meantime
active:  he used to write every day
active:  I took the letters in in the morning
active:  there was no need
noverb:  for father
active:  to know
active:  Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: We were engaged after the first walk
active:  we took
noverb:  Hosmer
noverb:  Mr. Angel
active:  was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--
noverb:  office
active:  That's the worst of it
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  I don't know
active:  Where did he live
active:  He slept on the premises
noverb:  And you don't know his address
noverb:  No
active:  it was Leadenhall Street
active:  Where did you address your letters
noverb:  To the Leadenhall Street Post Office
passive: to be left till called for
active:  He said
passive: they were sent to the office
passive: he would be chaffed by all the other clerks
active:  having letters from a lady
active:  I offered to typewrite them
noverb:  like he did his
noverb:  he wouldn't have
noverb:  for he said
active:  I wrote them
active:  they seemed
active:  to come from me
active:  they were typewritten
active:  he always felt
active:  the machine had come between us
active:  That will just show you
noverb:  fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things
active:  he would think of
active:  It was most suggestive
active:  said Holmes
active:  It has
active:  long been an axiom of mine
active:  the little things are infinitely the most important
active:  Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes
active:  He would rather walk with me in the evening
noverb:  in the daylight
noverb:  for he said
passive: he hated
active:  to be conspicuous
noverb:  Very retiring
noverb:  gentlemanly he was
active:  Even his voice was gentle
active:  He'd had the quinsy
active:  swollen glands
active:  he was young
noverb:  , he told me
active:  it had left him with a weak throat
noverb:  a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech
active:  He was always well
noverb:  dressed
noverb:  very neat and plain
active:  his eyes were weak
noverb:  just
active:  mine are
active:  he wore tinted glasses against the glare
noverb:  Well,
novoice: happened
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  your stepfather
active:  returned to France
active:  Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again
active:  proposed
active:  we should marry
active:  father came back
active:  He was in dreadful earnest
noverb:  made me swear
noverb:  with my hands on the Testament
novoice: happened
active:  I would always be true to him
active:  Mother said
active:  he was quite right
noverb:  to make me swear
active:  it was a sign of his passion
active:  Mother was all in his favour from the first
active:  was even fonder of him
active:  I was
active:  they talked
active:  marrying within the week
active:  I began
active:  to ask about father
noverb:  they
passive: said never
active:  to mind about father
noverb:  just
active:  to tell him afterwards
active:  mother said
active:  she would make it all right with him
noverb:  I didn't quite
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  It seemed funny
active:  I should ask his leave
active:  he was only a few years older
noverb:  than me
noverb:  I didn't want
active:  to do anything on the sly
active:  I wrote
active:  to father at Bordeaux
active:  the company has its French offices
active:  the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
active:  It missed him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  for he had started to England just
active:  it arrived
noverb:  Ha!
active:  was unfortunate
passive: Your wedding was arranged
noverb:  for the Friday
active:  Was it
active:  to be in church
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  very quietly
active:  It was
active:  to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross,
active:  we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel
active:  Hosmer came for us in a hansom
active:  there were two of us
active:  he put us
noverb:  into it
active:  stepped himself into a four-wheeler
active:  happened to be the only other cab in the street
active:  We got to the church first
active:  the four-wheeler drove up
active:  we waited for him
active:  to step out
active:  he never did
active:  the cabman got down from the box
active:  looked
active:  there was no one
noverb:  there
active:  The cabman said
active:  he could not imagine
active:  had become of him
noverb:  for he had seen him get in with his own eyes
active:  That was last Friday
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I have never seen or heard anything
active:  to throw any light upon
active:  became of him
active:  It seems to me
active:  you have been very shamefully treated
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  sir
active:  He was too good and kind
active:  to leave me
noverb:  all the morning
active:  he was saying to me
novoice: happened
active:  I was to be true
noverb:  and
noverb:  even
noverb:  something quite unforeseen occurred
active:  to separate us
active:  I was always to remember
passive: I was pledged to him
active:  he would claim his pledge sooner
noverb:  later
active:  It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning
active:  has happened
active:  gives a meaning to it
active:  Most certainly it does
active:  Your own opinion is
active:  some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I believe
active:  he foresaw some danger
active:  else he would not have talked
active:  And then I think
active:  he foresaw
novoice: happened
active:  you have no notion as to
active:  it could
passive: have been
noverb:  None
noverb:  One
noverb:  question
noverb:  did your mother take the matter
active:  She was angry
noverb:  ,
active:  said
noverb:  that I was never to speak of the matter again
noverb:  And your father
active:  Did you tell him
noverb:  Yes
active:  and he seemed
active:  to think, with me, that something
active:  had happened
active:  I should hear of Hosmer again
noverb:  As he said
noverb:  interest could anyone have
active:  bringing me to the doors of the church
active:  leaving me
noverb:  Now,
active:  he had borrowed my money
active:  he had married me
active:  got my money
novoice: settled on him
active:  there might be some reason
active:  Hosmer was very independent about money
active:  never would look at a shilling of mine
noverb:  And
active:  could have happened
noverb:  And
active:  could he not write
noverb:  Oh
active:  it drives me half-mad
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  I can't sleep a wink at night
active:  She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff
active:  began
active:  to sob heavily into it
active:  I shall glance into the case for you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  rising
active:  and I have no doubt
active:  we shall reach some definite result
active:  Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now
active:  do not let your mind
active:  dwell upon it further
noverb:  Above all
active:  try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory
active:  he has done from your life
noverb:  you don't think I'll see him again
active:  I fear not
active:  has happened to him
active:  You will leave
noverb:  question in my hands
active:  I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his
active:  you can spare
active:  I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle
active:  said she
active:  Here is the slip
active:  here are four letters from him
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And your address
noverb:  No
noverb:  31 Lyon Place
noverb:  Camberwell
noverb:  Mr. Angel's address
active:  you never had
active:  I understand
active:  Where is your father's place of business
active:  He travels for Westhouse & Marbank
noverb:  the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street
active:  Thank you
active:  You have made your statement very clearly
active:  You will leave the papers here
noverb:  ,
active:  remember the advice
active:  I have given you
active:  Let
active:  the whole incident be a sealed book
active:  do not allow it
active:  to affect your life
active:  You are very kind
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  I cannot do that
active:  I shall be true
noverb:  to Hosmer
noverb:  He shall find me ready
active:  he comes back
noverb:  For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face
active:  there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor
active:  compelled our respect
active:  She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table
active:  went her way
noverb:  with a promise
active:  to come again
passive: she might be summoned
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
passive: pressed together
novoice: his legs stretched out in front of him
noverb:  his gaze directed upward to the ceiling
active:  he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe
active:  was to him as a counsellor
active:  having lit it
active:  he leaned back in his chair
noverb:  with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him
noverb:  a look of infinite languor in his face
noverb:  Quite an interesting study
noverb:  that maiden
active:  he observed
active:  I found her more interesting
noverb:  her little problem
active:  , by the way, is rather a trite one
active:  You will find parallel cases
active:  you consult my index
noverb:  in Andover in '77
active:  there was something
noverb:  of the sort at The Hague last year
noverb:  Old
active:  is the idea, however,
active:  there were one or two details
active:  were new to me
noverb:  the maiden
active:  herself was most instructive
active:  You appeared to read a good deal upon her
active:  was quite invisible to me
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not invisible
noverb:  unnoticed
noverb:  Watson
active:  You did not know
active:  to look
active:  you missed all
active:  was important
active:  I can never bring you
active:  to realise the importance of sleeves
noverb:  the suggestiveness of thumb-nails
noverb:  the great issues
active:  may hang from a boot-lace
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  did you gather from that woman's appearance
active:  Describe it
noverb:  Well,
active:  she had a slate-coloured
noverb:  broad-brimmed straw hat
noverb:  with a feather of a brickish red
active:  Her jacket was black
noverb:  with black beads sewn upon it
noverb:  a fringe of little black jet ornaments
active:  Her dress was brown
noverb:  rather darker
active:  coffee colour
noverb:  with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves
active:  Her gloves were greyish
passive: were worn through at the right forefinger
noverb:  Her boots I didn't observe
active:  She had small round
noverb:  hanging gold earrings
noverb:  a general air
novoice: being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way
active:  Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together
novoice: chuckled
noverb:  Pon my word
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are coming along wonderfully
active:  You have really done very well indeed
active:  It is true
noverb:  that you have missed everything of importance
active:  you have hit upon the method
active:  you have a quick eye for colour
active:  Never trust
active:  to general impressions
noverb:  my boy
active:  concentrate yourself upon details
active:  My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve
noverb:  In a man
active:  it is perhaps better first
active:  to take the knee of the trouser
active:  you observe
active:  this woman had plush upon her sleeves
active:  is a most useful material for showing traces
active:  The double line a little above the wrist
noverb:  the typewritist presses against the table
passive: was beautifully defined
active:  The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark
noverb:  only on the left arm
noverb:  on the side of it farthest from the thumb
noverb:  instead
active:  being right across the broadest part
active:  this was
noverb:  I
novoice: glanced at her face
active:  observing the dint of a pince-nez at
noverb:  side of her nose
active:  I ventured a remark upon short sight
noverb:  typewriting
active:  seemed to surprise her
active:  It surprised me
noverb:  , surely,
active:  it was obvious
active:  I was
noverb:  much surprised
novoice: interested
active:  glancing down
active:  to observe
noverb:  the boots
active:  she was wearing
active:  were not unlike each other
active:  they were really odd ones
active:  the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap
noverb:  the other a plain one
passive: One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
noverb:  the other at the first, third
noverb:  fifth
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you see
noverb:  a young lady
noverb:  neatly dressed
active:  has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned
active:  it is no great deduction
active:  to say
active:  she came away in a hurry
noverb:  And
noverb:  else
active:  I asked
noverb:  keenly interested
noverb:  as I always was
noverb:  by my friend's incisive reasoning
active:  I noted, in passing,
active:  she had written a note
noverb:  leaving home
passive: being fully dressed
active:  You observed
passive: her right glove was torn at the forefinger
active:  you did not apparently see
noverb:  glove
passive: finger were stained with violet ink
active:  She had written in a hurry
active:  dipped her pen too deep
active:  It must have been this morning
active:  the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
noverb:  All this is amusing
noverb:  rather elementary
active:  I must go back to business
noverb:  Watson
active:  Would you mind
noverb:  reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  I held the little
active:  printed slip to the light
noverb:  Missing
active:  it said
noverb:  on the morning of the fourteenth
active:  a gentleman named Hosmer Angel
noverb:  About five ft
noverb:  seven in
noverb:  in height
noverb:  strongly built
noverb:  sallow complexion
noverb:  black hair
active:  a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers
noverb:  moustache
noverb:  tinted glasses
noverb:  slight infirmity of speech
passive: Was dressed
noverb:  last seen
noverb:  in black frock-coat faced with silk
noverb:  black waistcoat
noverb:  gold Albert chain
noverb:  grey Harris tweed trousers
noverb:  with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots
active:  Known
passive: to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street
noverb:  Anybody bringing
active:  That will do
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  As to the letters
active:  he continued
active:  glancing over them
active:  they are very commonplace
noverb:  Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel
noverb:  save
active:  he quotes Balzac once
active:  There is one remarkable point, however,
active:  will no doubt strike you
active:  They are typewritten
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Not only
active:  the signature is typewritten
noverb:  Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom
active:  There is a date
noverb:  you see
noverb:  no superscription
noverb:  Leadenhall Street
active:  is rather vague
active:  The point about the signature is very suggestive
noverb:  in fact
active:  we may call it conclusive
noverb:  Of
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  is it possible you do not see
noverb:  strongly it bears upon the case
active:  I cannot say
active:  I do
active:  it were
active:  he wished to be able
active:  to deny his signature
passive: an action for breach of promise were instituted
noverb:  No
active:  that was not the point
noverb:  However,
active:  I shall write two letters
active:  should settle the matter
active:  One is to a firm in the City
active:  the other is
active:  to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him
noverb:  he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening
active:  It is just as well
active:  we should do business with the male relatives
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we can do nothing until the answers to those letters
active:  come
active:  we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
active:  I had had so many reasons
active:  to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning
noverb:  extraordinary energy in action
active:  I felt
active:  he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with
active:  he treated the singular mystery
passive: he had been called upon
active:  to fathom
active:  Once only had I known him
active:  to fail
noverb:  in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph
active:  I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four
novoice: the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet
active:  I felt
active:  it would be a strange tangle indeed
active:  he could not unravel
active:  I left him
active:  still puffing at his black clay pipe
noverb:  with the conviction
active:  I came again on the next evening
active:  I would find
active:  he held in his hands all the clues
active:  would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
active:  A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time
noverb:  the whole of next day
active:  I was busy
noverb:  at the bedside of the sufferer
active:  It was not until close upon six o'clock
active:  I found myself free
active:  was able
active:  to spring into a hansom
noverb:  drive to Baker Street
noverb:  half afraid
active:  I might be too late
active:  to assist at the denouement of the little mystery
active:  I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair
noverb:  A formidable array of bottles
noverb:  test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me
active:  he had spent his day in the chemical work
active:  was so dear to him
noverb:  Well,
passive: have
active:  you solved it
active:  I asked
active:  I entered
noverb:  Yes
active:  It was the bisulphate of baryta
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the mystery
active:  I cried
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  that
active:  I thought of the salt
active:  I have been working upon
active:  There was never any mystery
noverb:  in the matter, though, as I said yesterday
active:  some of the details are of interest
active:  The only drawback is
active:  there is no law
active:  I fear
active:  that can touch the scoundrel
active:  was he
active:  was his object
active:  deserting Miss Sutherland
active:  The question was hardly out of my mouth
active:  Holmes had not yet opened his lips
active:  to reply
active:  we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
active:  This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  He has written to me
active:  to say
active:  he would be here
noverb:  at six
active:  Come in
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a sturdy
noverb:  middle-sized fellow
noverb:  some thirty years of age, clean-shaven
noverb:  sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner
noverb:  a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes
active:  He shot a questioning glance at each of us
active:  placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard
novoice: with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
noverb:  Good-evening
noverb:  Mr. James Windibank
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  this typewritten letter is from
noverb:  you
noverb:  in
active:  you made an appointment with me for six o'clock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am a little late
active:  I am not quite my own master
active:  you know
active:  I am sorry
noverb:  that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter
noverb:  for I think
novoice: it is far
noverb:  better not
active:  to wash linen of the sort in public
active:  It was quite against my wishes
active:  she came
active:  she is a very excitable, impulsive girl
noverb:  as you may have noticed
passive: she is not easily controlled
active:  she has made up her mind on a point
noverb:  Of course
active:  I did not mind you
noverb:  much
passive: you are not connected with the official police
active:  it is not pleasant
noverb:  to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is a useless expense
noverb:  for
active:  could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  I have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  I will succeed
active:  discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel
active:  Mr. Windibank gave a violent start
active:  dropped his gloves
passive: I am delighted
active:  to hear it
active:  he said
active:  It is a curious thing
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting
active:  they are quite new
noverb:  , no two of them write exactly alike
active:  Some letters get more worn
noverb:  others
noverb:  some wear only on one side
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  you remark in this note of yours
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
noverb:  in every case
active:  there is some little
active:  slurring over of the 'e
noverb:  a slight defect in the tail of the 'r
active:  There are fourteen other characteristics
noverb:  those are the more obvious
active:  We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it is a little worn
active:  our visitor answered
active:  glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
active:  And now I will show you
active:  is really a very interesting study
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Holmes continued
active:  I think
active:  writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation
active:  to crime
active:  It is a subject to
active:  I have devoted some little attention
active:  I have here four letters
active:  purport
active:  to come from the missing man
active:  They are all
active:  typewritten
noverb:  In each case
active:  not only are the 'e's' slurred
noverb:  the 'r's' tailless
active:  you will observe
noverb:  you care
noverb:  to use my magnifying lens
noverb:  the fourteen other characteristics to
active:  I have alluded
active:  are there as well
active:  Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair
active:  picked up his hat
active:  I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes
active:  he said
active:  you can catch the man
active:  catch him
noverb:  let me know
active:  you have done it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  said Holmes
active:  stepping over
active:  turning the key in the door
active:  I let
active:  you know
active:  I have caught him
noverb:  !
noverb:  shouted Mr. Windibank
noverb:  turning white to his lips
active:  glancing about him like a rat in a trap
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  it won't do
noverb:  really it won't
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  There is no possible
active:  getting out of it, Mr. Windibank
active:  It is quite too transparent
active:  it was a very bad compliment
active:  you said
active:  it was impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to solve
noverb:  simple a question
active:  That's right
active:  Sit down
noverb:  let us talk it over
active:  Our visitor collapsed into a chair
noverb:  with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow
noverb:  It
active:  it's not actionable
active:  he stammered
active:  I am very much
noverb:  afraid
active:  it is not
noverb:  between ourselves
noverb:  Windibank
active:  it was as cruel
noverb:  selfish
noverb:  heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came
noverb:  me
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  let me just run over the course of events
active:  you will contradict me
active:  I go wrong
active:  The man sat huddled up in his chair
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  like one
passive: is utterly crushed
active:  Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece
noverb:  leaning back with his hands in his pockets
active:  began talking
noverb:  rather to himself
novoice: it seemed
noverb:  to us
active:  The man married a woman very much older
noverb:  himself for her money
active:  said he
active:  and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter
active:  she lived with them
active:  It was a considerable sum
noverb:  for people in their position
active:  the loss of it would have made a serious difference
active:  It was worth
noverb:  an effort
active:  to preserve it
active:  The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition
noverb:  affectionate
noverb:  warm-hearted in her ways
active:  it was evident
noverb:  that with her fair personal advantages
noverb:  her little income
passive: she would not be allowed
active:  to remain single long
active:  Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year
active:  does her stepfather
active:  do to prevent it
active:  He takes the obvious course
active:  keeping her at home
active:  forbidding her
active:  to seek the company of people of her own age
active:  soon he found
active:  that would not answer forever
active:  She became restive
novoice: insisted upon her rights
active:  finally announced her positive intention
active:  going to a certain ball
active:  does her clever stepfather
active:  do
active:  He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
noverb:  than to his heart
active:  With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
active:  covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses
active:  masked the face with a moustache
noverb:  a pair of bushy whiskers
noverb:  sunk
noverb:  clear voice into an insinuating whisper
active:  doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight
active:  he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel
noverb:  keeps off other lovers by making love himself
active:  It was only a joke
noverb:  at first
active:  groaned our visitor
active:  We never thought
active:  she would have been
novoice: carried away
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  However that may be
active:  the young lady was very decidedly carried away
active:  having quite made up her mind
active:  her stepfather was in France
noverb:  the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind
passive: She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions
passive: the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother
active:  Then Mr. Angel began
active:  to call
active:  for it was obvious
noverb:  that the matter should be pushed
active:  it would go
active:  a real effect were to be produced
active:  There were meetings
noverb:  ,
noverb:  an engagement
active:  would finally secure the girl's affections
active:  turning towards anyone else
passive: the deception could not be kept up forever
active:  These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous
noverb:  The thing
active:  to do
active:  was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner
active:  it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind
active:  prevent her
active:  looking upon any other suitor for some time
active:  to come
active:  Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament
noverb:  hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding
active:  James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland
active:  to be
novoice: bound to Hosmer Angel
noverb:  so uncertain as to his fate
noverb:  for ten years
active:  to come, at any rate,
active:  she would not listen to another man
noverb:  the church door
active:  he brought her
noverb:  as he could go no farther
noverb:  he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
active:  stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler
noverb:  out at the other
active:  I think
active:  was the chain of events
noverb:  Mr. Windibank
active:  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance
active:  Holmes had been talking
active:  he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
active:  It may be
active:  it may not
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  you are
noverb:  very sharp you ought to be sharp enough
active:  to know
active:  it is you
active:  are breaking the law now
noverb:  not me
active:  I have done nothing actionable from the first
noverb:  ,
noverb:  you keep
active:  door locked
noverb:  you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
active:  The law cannot
active:  you say
active:  touch you
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  unlocking and throwing open the door
noverb:  yet
active:  there never was a man
noverb:  who deserved punishment
active:  the young lady has a brother or a friend
active:  he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders
noverb:  By Jove
active:  he continued
active:  flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face
active:  it is not part of my duties
noverb:  to my client
noverb:  here's a hunting crop handy
noverb:  ,
active:  I think
active:  I shall just treat myself to
active:  He took two swift steps to the whip
active:  he could grasp it
active:  there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
novoice: the heavy hall door banged
noverb:  from the window
active:  we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
active:  There's a cold-blooded scoundrel
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  he threw himself down into his chair once
active:  That fellow will rise from crime to crime
active:  he does something very bad
noverb:  ,
noverb:  ends on a gallows
active:  The case has
active:  , in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest
active:  I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  of course
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct
active:  it was equally clear
noverb:  that the only man
passive: really profited by the incident
active:  we could see
active:  was the stepfather
noverb:  the fact
active:  the two men were never together
novoice: the one always appeared
active:  the other was away
active:  was suggestive
active:  So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
novoice: hinted at a disguise
active:  did the bushy whiskers
active:  My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action
active:  typewriting his signature
active:  , of course, inferred
active:  his handwriting was so familiar to her
active:  she would recognise even the smallest sample of it
active:  You see all these isolated facts
noverb:  together with many minor ones
noverb:  all pointed in the same direction
noverb:  And
active:  did you verify them
active:  Having once spotted my man
active:  it was easy
active:  to get corroboration
active:  I knew the firm for
active:  this man worked
active:  Having taken the printed description
active:  I eliminated everything from it
active:  could be the result of a disguise
noverb:  the whiskers, the glasses, the voice
active:  I sent it to the firm
noverb:  with a request
active:  they would inform me
active:  it answered to the description of any of their travellers
active:  I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter
noverb:  I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him
active:  he would come here
active:  As I expected
active:  his reply was typewritten
active:  revealed the same trivial
noverb:  characteristic defects
noverb:  The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street,
active:  to say
active:  the description tallied in every respect with
noverb:  of their employe, James Windibank
noverb:  Voila tout
noverb:  And Miss Sutherland
noverb:  I tell her she will not believe me
active:  You may remember the old Persian
active:  saying
active:  There is danger
noverb:  for him
noverb:  taketh the tiger cub
noverb:  danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman
active:  There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace
noverb:  as much knowledge of the world
noverb:  ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
passive: We were seated at breakfast one morning
noverb:  my wife and I
active:  the maid brought in a telegram
active:  It was from Sherlock Holmes
active:  ran in this way
active:  Have you a couple of days
active:  to spare
passive: Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy
active:  Shall be glad
active:  you will come with me
noverb:  Air and scenery perfect
noverb:  Leave Paddington by the 11
noverb:  15
active:  do you say
noverb:  dear
active:  said
noverb:  my wife
noverb:  looking across at me
active:  Will you go
noverb:  I really don't know
active:  to say
active:  I have a fairly long list at present
noverb:  Oh
active:  Anstruther would do your work for you
active:  You have been looking a little pale lately
active:  I think
noverb:  the change would do you good
active:  you are always
noverb:  interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases
active:  I should be ungrateful
noverb:  if I were not
noverb:  seeing
active:  I gained through one of them
active:  I answered
active:  I am to go
active:  I must pack at once
noverb:  for I have only half an hour
active:  My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
noverb:  making me a prompt and ready traveller
active:  My wants were few and simple
noverb:  in less than the time stated
active:  I was in a cab with my valise
noverb:  rattling away to Paddington Station
active:  Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform
noverb:  his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter
noverb:  taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap
active:  It is really very good
noverb:  of you
active:  to come
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes a considerable difference to me
active:  having someone with me on
active:  I can thoroughly rely
active:  Local aid is always
noverb:  worthless
novoice: else biassed
active:  you will keep the two corner seats
active:  I shall get the tickets
noverb:  We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
active:  Holmes had brought with him
noverb:  Among these he rummaged and read
noverb:  with intervals of note-taking and of meditation
active:  we were past Reading
active:  he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball
active:  tossed them up onto the rack
active:  Have you heard anything of the case
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not a word
active:  I have not seen a paper for some days
active:  The London press has not had very full accounts
active:  I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order
active:  to master the particulars
active:  It seems
noverb:  from
active:  I gather
active:  to be one of those simple cases
active:  are
noverb:  extremely difficult
active:  That sounds a little paradoxical
active:  it is profoundly true
active:  Singularity is almost invariably a clue
noverb:  The more featureless
noverb:  commonplace a crime is
noverb:  the more difficult it is to bring it home
active:  In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
active:  It is a murder
noverb:  Well,
passive: it is conjectured
active:  to be
active:  I shall take nothing for granted
active:  I have the opportunity of looking personally into it
active:  I will explain the state of things to you
active:  I have been able
active:  to understand it

active:  he held
noverb:  of Hatherley
passive: was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy
noverb:  who was also an ex-Australian
active:  The men had known each other in the colonies
active:  it was not unnatural
noverb:  that
active:  they came
active:  to settle down
active:  they should do
noverb:  near each other as possible
active:  Turner was apparently the richer man

active:  The game-keeper adds
active:  within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass
active:  he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy,
active:  going the same way with a gun under his arm
noverb:  To the best of his belief
active:  the father was actually in sight at the time
active:  the son was following him
active:  He thought no
noverb:  of the matter
active:  he heard in the evening of the tragedy
active:  had occurred

active:  The injuries were
active:  might very well
passive: have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun

noverb:  a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday

noverb:  the magistrates at Ross
active:  have referred the case to the next Assizes
noverb:  Those are the main facts of the case
active:  they came out
noverb:  the coroner and the police-court
active:  I could hardly imagine a more damning case
active:  I remarked
active:  circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal
active:  it does
noverb:  here
active:  Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing
active:  answered Holmes thoughtfully
active:  It may seem to point very straight to one thing
noverb:  you shift your own point of view a little
active:  you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
passive: It must be confessed, however,
active:  the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man
active:  it is very possible
noverb:  that he is indeed the culprit
active:  There are several people in the neighbourhood, however,
noverb:  among them Miss Turner
noverb:  the daughter of the neighbouring landowner
active:  believe in his innocence
active:  have retained Lestrade
active:  you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet
active:  to work out the case in his interest
noverb:  Lestrade
passive: being rather puzzled
active:  has referred the case to me
active:  hence it is
active:  two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
active:  I am afraid
active:  said I
active:  the facts are so obvious
active:  you will find little credit
passive: to be gained out of this case
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more deceptive
noverb:  an obvious fact
active:  he answered
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Besides
active:  we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
active:  may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade
active:  You know me too well
active:  to think
active:  I am boasting
active:  I say
active:  I shall
active:  confirm or destroy his theory by means
active:  he is quite incapable
noverb:  of employing
noverb:  even of understanding
active:  To take the first example
active:  to hand
noverb:  I very clearly perceive
active:  in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side
active:  I question
active:  Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that
noverb:  on earth
noverb:  My dear fellow
noverb:  I know you well
active:  I know the military neatness
noverb:  characterises you
active:  You shave every morning
noverb:  in this season you shave by the sunlight
active:  your shaving is less and less complete
active:  we get farther back on the left side
active:  it becomes positively slovenly
active:  we get round the angle of the jaw

noverb:  that that side is less illuminated
noverb:  the other
active:  I could not imagine a man of your habits
active:  looking at himself in an equal light
passive: being satisfied with such a result
active:  I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
noverb:  Therein lies my metier
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that it may be of some service in the investigation
noverb:  lies
noverb:  us
active:  There are one or two minor points
passive: were brought out in the inquest
active:  are worth
active:  considering
active:  are they
active:  It appears
active:  his arrest did not take place at once
noverb:  after the return to Hatherley Farm
active:  On the inspector of constabulary informing him
active:  he was a prisoner
active:  he remarked
passive: he was not surprised
active:  to hear it
active:  it was no more than his deserts
noverb:  This observation of his had the natural effect
active:  removing any traces of doubt
active:  might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
active:  It was a confession
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  No
passive: for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
noverb:  Coming on the top of such a damning series of events
active:  it was at least a most suspicious remark
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said Holmes
active:  it is the brightest rift
noverb:  which I can at present see in the clouds
noverb:  However innocent he might be
active:  he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not
active:  to see
active:  the circumstances were very black against him
active:  Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest
noverb:  feigned indignation at it
active:  I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious
noverb:  such surprise
active:  anger would not be natural under the circumstances
active:  might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
active:  His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
noverb:  an innocent man
noverb:  else as a man of considerable self-restraint
noverb:  firmness
noverb:  As to his remark about his deserts
active:  it was also not unnatural
noverb:  if you consider
active:  he stood beside the dead body of his father
active:  there is no doubt
noverb:  that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as
active:  to bandy words with him
noverb:  even
noverb:  according to the little girl
active:  evidence is so important
active:  to raise his hand as
active:  to strike him
noverb:  The self-reproach
noverb:  contrition
passive: are displayed
active:  in his remark appear to me
active:  to be the signs of a healthy mind rather
noverb:  of a guilty one
active:  I shook my head
passive: Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence
active:  I remarked
active:  they have
passive: And many men have been wrongfully hanged
active:  is the young man's own account of the matter
active:  It is
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , not very encouraging to his supporters
active:  there are one or two points in it
active:  are suggestive
noverb:  You will find it here
active:  may read it for yourself
active:  He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper
active:  having turned down the sheet
active:  he pointed out the paragraph in
active:  the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of
active:  had occurred
active:  I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage
active:  read
noverb:  it very carefully
active:  It ran in this way
active:  Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was
noverb:  called
active:  gave evidence
active:  follows
active:  I had been away from home for three days at Bristol
active:  had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday
noverb:  the 3rd
active:  My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival
passive: I was informed by the maid
active:  he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom
noverb:  Shortly after my return
active:  I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard
noverb:  looking out of my window
noverb:  I saw him get out
active:  walk rapidly out of the yard
active:  I was not aware
noverb:  in
noverb:  direction he was going
noverb:  I
active:  took my gun
active:  strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool
noverb:  with the intention
active:  visiting the rabbit warren
active:  is upon the other side
active:  On my way I saw William Crowder
noverb:  the game-keeper
active:  he had stated in his evidence
passive: he is mistaken
active:  thinking
active:  I was following my father
active:  I had no idea
active:  he was in front of me
active:  When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of
noverb:  Cooee
active:  was a usual signal between my father and myself
noverb:  I
noverb:  hurried forward
active:  found him standing by the pool
active:  He appeared
passive: to be much surprised
active:  seeing me
active:  asked me rather roughly
active:  I was doing there
active:  A conversation ensued
active:  led to high words
noverb:  almost to blows
active:  for my father was a man of a very violent temper
active:  Seeing
active:  his passion was becoming ungovernable
active:  I left him
active:  returned towards Hatherley Farm
active:  I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
active:  I heard a hideous outcry behind me
active:  caused me
active:  to run back again
active:  I found
active:  my father expiring upon the ground
noverb:  with his head terribly injured
active:  I dropped my gun
active:  held him in my arms
noverb:  he almost
noverb:  expired
active:  I knelt beside him for some minutes
active:  made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper
novoice: his house being the nearest
active:  to ask for assistance
active:  I saw no one near my father
active:  I returned
active:  I have no idea
active:  he came by his injuries
active:  He was not a popular man
active:  being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners
active:  he had
active:  I know
noverb:  no active enemies
active:  I know nothing further of the matter
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  Did your father make any statement to you
active:  he died
noverb:  Witness
active:  He mumbled a few words
active:  I could only catch some allusion to a rat
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  did you understand by that
noverb:  Witness
active:  It conveyed no meaning to me
active:  I thought
active:  he was delirious
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was the point upon
noverb:  you
active:  your father had this final quarrel
noverb:  Witness
active:  I should prefer not
active:  to answer
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must press it
noverb:  Witness
active:  It is really impossible
noverb:  for me
active:  to tell you
active:  I can assure you
active:  it has nothing
active:  to do with the sad tragedy
active:  followed
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  That is for the court
active:  to decide
active:  I need
active:  not point out to you
noverb:  your refusal
active:  to answer
active:  will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings
active:  may arise
noverb:  Witness
active:  I must still refuse
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  I understand
noverb:  the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
noverb:  Witness
active:  It was
noverb:  The Coroner
active:  was it
active:  he uttered it
active:  he saw you
active:  he even knew
active:  you had returned from Bristol
noverb:  Witness (with considerable confusion)
active:  I do not know
noverb:  A Juryman
active:  Did you see nothing
active:  aroused your suspicions
active:  you returned
active:  hearing the cry
noverb:  found your father fatally injured
noverb:  Witness
noverb:  Nothing definite
noverb:  The Coroner
noverb:  do you mean
noverb:  Witness
active:  I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open
active:  I could think of nothing
noverb:  of my father
active:  Yet I have a vague impression
active:  I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
active:  It seemed to me
active:  to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort,
noverb:  a plaid perhaps
active:  When I rose from my father
active:  I looked round for it
passive: it was gone
active:  Do you mean
active:  it disappeared
active:  you went for help
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was gone
active:  You cannot say
active:  it was
noverb:  No
active:  I had
active:  a feeling something was there
noverb:  far from the body
noverb:  A dozen yards
noverb:  And
noverb:  far from the edge of the wood
noverb:  About the same
passive: it was removed
active:  it was
active:  you were within a dozen yards of it
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  with my back towards it
noverb:  This concluded the examination of the witness
active:  I see
active:  said I
active:  I glanced down the column
active:  the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy
active:  He calls attention
noverb:  with reason
active:  to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him
active:  seeing him
noverb:  also to his refusal
active:  to give details of his conversation with his father
noverb:  his singular account of his father's dying words
active:  They are all
noverb:  , as he remarks
noverb:  very much against the son
active:  Holmes laughed softly to himself
active:  stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
noverb:  you
active:  the coroner have been at some pains
active:  said he
active:  to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
noverb:  Don't you see
noverb:  you alternately give him credit
active:  having too much imagination
noverb:  too little
noverb:  Too little
active:  he could not invent a cause of quarrel
noverb:  would give him the sympathy of the jury
noverb:  too much
active:  he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat
noverb:  the incident of the vanishing cloth
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I shall approach this case from the point of view
active:  this young man says
active:  is true
active:  we shall see whither
active:  hypothesis will lead us
active:  And now here is my pocket Petrarch
noverb:  not another word shall I say of this case
active:  we are on the scene of action
active:  We lunch at Swindon
active:  I see
active:  we shall be there
noverb:  in twenty minutes
active:  It was nearly four
noverb:  o'clock
noverb:  we at last
active:  passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley
noverb:  over the broad gleaming Severn
active:  found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross
noverb:  A lean, ferret-like man
noverb:  furtive
noverb:  sly-looking
active:  was waiting for us upon the platform
noverb:  In spite of the light brown dustcoat
noverb:  leather-leggings
active:  he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  recognising Lestrade
noverb:  of Scotland Yard
active:  With him we drove to the Hereford Arms
passive: a room had already been engaged for us
active:  I have ordered a carriage
active:  said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
active:  I knew your energetic nature
active:  you would not be happy
active:  you had been on the scene of the crime
active:  It was very nice and complimentary of you
active:  Holmes answered
active:  It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
active:  Lestrade looked startled
active:  I do not quite follow
active:  he said
active:  is the glass
noverb:  Twenty-nine
active:  I see
noverb:  No wind
noverb:  not a cloud in the sky
active:  I have a caseful of cigarettes here
active:  need smoking
active:  the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
active:  I do not think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that I shall use the carriage to-night
active:  Lestrade laughed indulgently
active:  You have
noverb:  no doubt
active:  already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
active:  he said
active:  The case is
noverb:  a pikestaff
noverb:  the more one goes into it the plainer
active:  it becomes
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
noverb:  one can't refuse a lady
noverb:  such a very positive one
noverb:  too
active:  She has heard of
noverb:  you
active:  would have your opinion
novoice: I repeatedly told her
active:  there was nothing
noverb:  which you could do
active:  I had not already done
active:  bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door
active:  He had hardly spoken
active:  there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women
active:  I have
noverb:  seen in my life
noverb:  Her violet eyes shining
noverb:  her lips parted
noverb:  a pink flush upon her cheeks
active:  all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  she cried
active:  glancing from one to the other of us
noverb:  finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion
active:  I am so glad
noverb:  that you have come
active:  I have driven down
active:  to tell you
active:  I know
noverb:  James didn't do it
active:  I know it
active:  I want you
active:  to start
active:  upon your work knowing it
noverb:  too
noverb:  Never let yourself doubt upon
noverb:  point
active:  We have known each other
active:  we were little children
active:  I know his faults as no one else
active:  does
active:  he is too tender-hearted
active:  to hurt a fly
active:  Such a charge is absurd to anyone
active:  really knows him
active:  I hope
active:  we may clear him, Miss Turner
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  You may rely upon my doing all
active:  I can
active:  you have read the evidence
active:  You have formed some conclusion
active:  Do you not see some loophole, some flaw
noverb:  Do you not yourself think
active:  he is innocent
active:  I think
active:  it is very probable
noverb:  There
noverb:  now
active:  she cried
active:  throwing
active:  back her head
noverb:  looking defiantly at Lestrade
active:  You hear
noverb:  He gives me hopes
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that my colleague has been a little quick
active:  forming his conclusions
active:  he said
active:  he is right
noverb:  Oh
active:  I know
active:  he is right
active:  James never did it
noverb:  And about his quarrel with his father
active:  I am sure
noverb:  the reason
active:  he would not speak
active:  about it to the coroner was
passive: I was concerned in
noverb:  it
noverb:  In
noverb:  way
active:  asked Holmes
active:  It is no time for me
active:  to hide anything
noverb:  James
active:  his father had many disagreements about me
active:  Mr. McCarthy was very anxious
active:  there should be a marriage
noverb:  between us
noverb:  James
active:  I have always loved each other as brother and sister
noverb:  of course
active:  he is young
noverb:  and has seen very little of life
noverb:  --and--well
active:  he naturally did not wish to do anything like
active:  there were quarrels
noverb:  this
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , was one of them
noverb:  And your father
active:  asked Holmes
active:  Was he in favour of such a union
noverb:  No
active:  he was averse
noverb:  to it also
noverb:  No one
active:  Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it
active:  A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen
active:  questioning glances at her
active:  Thank you for this information
active:  said he
active:  May I see your father
noverb:  I call to-morrow
noverb:  ?
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  the doctor won't allow it
noverb:  The doctor
noverb:  Yes
active:  have you not heard
active:  Poor father has never been strong for years back
active:  this has broken him down completely
active:  He has taken to his bed
active:  Dr. Willows says
noverb:  that he is a wreck
passive: his nervous system is shattered
active:  Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
noverb:  who had known dad in the old days in Victoria
noverb:  Ha
noverb:  In Victoria
active:  That is important
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  at the mines
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  at the gold-mines
active:  I understand
active:  Mr. Turner made his money
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  certainly
active:  Thank you, Miss Turner
active:  You have been of material assistance to me
active:  You will tell me
active:  you have any news to-morrow
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you will go to the prison
active:  to see James
noverb:  Oh
active:  you do
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  do tell him
active:  I know him
active:  to be innocent
active:  I will
noverb:  Miss Turner
active:  I must go home now
active:  for dad is very ill
active:  he misses me
active:  I leave him
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  God help you in your undertaking
active:  She hurried from the room
active:  she had entered
active:  we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
active:  I am ashamed
noverb:  of you, Holmes
active:  said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
active:  should you raise up hopes
passive: you are bound
active:  to disappoint
active:  I am not over-tender
noverb:  of heart
active:  I call it cruel
active:  I think
active:  I see my way
active:  to clearing James McCarthy
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Have you an order
active:  to see him in prison
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only for you and me
active:  I shall reconsider my resolution
active:  going out
active:  We have
active:  still time to take a train to Hereford
active:  see him to-night?
noverb:  Ample
noverb:  let us do
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
active:  you will find it very slow
active:  I shall only be away a couple of hours
active:  I walked down to the station with them
novoice: wandered through the streets of the little town
active:  finally returning to the hotel
active:  I lay upon the sofa
active:  tried
active:  to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel
active:  The puny plot of the story was so thin
noverb:  however
passive: compared to the deep mystery through
active:  we were groping
active:  I found
active:  my attention wander
noverb:  continually from the action to the fact
noverb:  I at last flung it across the room
active:  gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
noverb:  Supposing
active:  this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true
noverb:  hellish thing
noverb:  absolutely unforeseen
active:  extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time
active:  he parted from his father
noverb:  the moment
noverb:  drawn back by his screams
active:  he rushed into the glade
active:  It was something
noverb:  terrible and deadly
active:  could it be
active:  Might not the nature of the injuries
active:  reveal something to my medical instincts
active:  I rang the bell
active:  called for the weekly county paper
active:  contained a verbatim account of the inquest
passive: In the surgeon's deposition it was stated
noverb:  the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone
passive: had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
active:  I marked the spot upon my own head
passive: Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
active:  That was to some extent in favour of the accused
noverb:  as
noverb:  seen quarrelling
active:  he was face to face
noverb:  with his father
noverb:  Still,
active:  it did not go for very much
active:  for the older man might have turned his back
active:  the blow fell
noverb:  Still,
active:  it might be worth
noverb:  while
active:  to call Holmes' attention to it
active:  there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
active:  could
noverb:  mean
active:  It could not be delirium
noverb:  A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
noverb:  No
active:  it was more
noverb:  likely
active:  to be an attempt
active:  to explain
active:  he met his fate
active:  could it indicate
active:  I cudgelled my brains
active:  to find some possible explanation
active:  And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy
active:  were true the murderer
active:  must have dropped some part of his dress
noverb:  presumably his overcoat, in his flight,
active:  must have had the hardihood
active:  to return
active:  to carry it away at the instant
active:  the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
noverb:  a tissue of mysteries
noverb:  improbabilities the whole thing was
active:  I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion
active:  I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight
active:  I could not lose hope
novoice: every fresh fact seemed
active:  to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence
active:  It was late
active:  Sherlock Holmes returned
active:  He came back alone
active:  for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
noverb:  The glass still keeps very high
active:  he remarked as
active:  he sat down
active:  It is of importance
active:  it should not rain
active:  we are able
active:  to go over the ground
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  a man should be at his very best
noverb:  keenest for such nice work as
active:  I did not wish to do it
novoice: fagged by a long journey
active:  I have seen young McCarthy
noverb:  And
active:  did you learn from him
noverb:  Nothing
active:  Could he throw no light
noverb:  None at all
passive: I was inclined
active:  to think at one time
active:  he knew
active:  had done it
active:  was screening him
noverb:  her
passive: I am convinced now
active:  he is
noverb:  everyone else
active:  He is not a very quick-witted youth
noverb:  comely
active:  to look at
active:  I should think
noverb:  sound at heart
active:  I cannot admire his taste
active:  I remarked
active:  it is indeed a fact
noverb:  that he was averse
noverb:  to a marriage with
active:  charming a young lady as this Miss Turner
noverb:  Ah
active:  thereby hangs a rather painful tale
active:  This fellow is madly
noverb:  insanely
noverb:  in love with her
noverb:  some two years ago
active:  he was only a lad
active:  he really knew her
noverb:  for she had been away five years at a boarding-school
active:  does the idiot
active:  do
active:  get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol
active:  marry her at a registry office
active:  No one knows a word of the matter
active:  you can imagine
active:  maddening
active:  it must be to him
active:  to be upbraided for not doing
active:  he would give his very eyes
active:  to do
active:  he knows to be absolutely impossible
active:  It was sheer frenzy of this sort
noverb:  made him throw his hands up into the air
active:  his father, at their last interview, was goading him on
active:  to propose to Miss Turner
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he had no means
active:  supporting himself
noverb:  his father
active:  was by all accounts a very hard man
active:  would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
active:  It was with his barmaid wife
active:  he had spent the last three days in Bristol
active:  his father did not know
active:  he was
noverb:  Mark
active:  point
active:  It is of importance
active:  Good has come out of evil
noverb:  however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
active:  he is in serious trouble
noverb:  likely
passive: to be hanged
active:  has thrown him over utterly
active:  has written to him
active:  to say
active:  she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard
active:  there is really no tie
noverb:  between them
active:  I think
active:  bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
active:  he has suffered
active:  he is innocent
noverb:  ,
active:  has done it
noverb:  Ah!
active:  I would call your attention very particularly to two points
active:  One is
active:  the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool
active:  the someone could not have been his son
active:  for his son was away
active:  he did not know
active:  he would return
active:  The second is
passive: the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee
active:  he knew
active:  his son had returned
noverb:  Those are the crucial points upon
active:  the case depends
noverb:  And now let us talk about George Meredith
noverb:  you
active:  we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
active:  There was no rain
active:  Holmes had foretold
noverb:  the morning broke bright
noverb:  cloudless
noverb:  At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage
active:  we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
active:  There is serious news this morning
active:  Lestrade observed
active:  It is said
active:  Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill
passive: his life is despaired of
noverb:  An elderly man
active:  I presume
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  About sixty
passive: his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad
active:  he has been in failing health for some time
active:  This business has had a very bad effect upon him
active:  He was an old friend of McCarthy's
active:  I may add
noverb:  a great benefactor to him
noverb:  for I have learned
noverb:  he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is interesting
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  In a hundred other ways
active:  he has helped him
noverb:  Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
noverb:  Really
active:  Does it not strike you as a little singular
noverb:  this McCarthy
active:  appears to have had little of his own
active:  to have been under such obligations to Turner
active:  should still talk
active:  marrying his son to Turner's daughter
active:  is
noverb:  presumably
noverb:  heiress to the estate
noverb:  in such a very cocksure manner
noverb:  as
active:  it were merely a case of a proposal
noverb:  and all else would follow
active:  It is the
noverb:  more strange
active:  we know that Turner
active:  himself was averse
noverb:  to the idea
active:  The daughter told us as much
active:  Do you not deduce something from that
active:  We have got to the deductions and the inferences
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  winking at me
active:  I find it hard enough
active:  to tackle facts
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  without flying away after theories and fancies
active:  You are right
active:  said Holmes demurely
active:  you do find it very hard
active:  to tackle the facts
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  I have grasped one fact
active:  you seem to find it difficult
active:  to get hold of
active:  replied Lestrade with some warmth
noverb:  And
active:  is
active:  That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior
active:  all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
noverb:  Well,
active:  moonshine is a brighter thing
noverb:  fog
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  But I am very much mistaken
active:  this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left
noverb:  Yes

noverb:  whipcord in his long

active:  his mind was
novoice: absolutely concentrated upon the matter
noverb:  him
noverb:  a question
noverb:  remark fell unheeded upon his ears
noverb:  at the
active:  only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply
noverb:  Swiftly

noverb:  Lestrade showed us the exact spot at

noverb:  indeed
noverb:  so moist was the ground
active:  I could plainly see the traces

noverb:  To Holmes
noverb:  as I could see by his eager face

noverb:  on earth
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut
active:  I have no time

noverb:  under the shadow of a great beech
noverb:  the largest tree in the neighbourhood

active:  lay down once
noverb:  upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction

noverb:  turning over the leaves
noverb:  dried sticks
active:  gathering up

noverb:  this also he carefully examined and retained

passive: all traces were lost
active:  It has been a case of considerable interest
active:  he remarked

active:  this grey house on the right must be the lodge
active:  I think
active:  I will go in

active:  he remarked
active:  holding it out
passive: The murder was done with
noverb:  it
active:  I see no marks
active:  There are none
active:  do you know
active:  The grass was growing under
noverb:  it
active:  It had only lain there a few days
active:  There was no sign of a place whence
passive: it had been taken
active:  It corresponds with the injuries
active:  There is no sign of any other weapon
noverb:  And the murderer
noverb:  Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg
active:  wears thick-soled shooting-boots
noverb:  a grey cloak
noverb:  smokes Indian cigars
noverb:  uses a cigar-holder
noverb:  carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket
active:  There are several other indications
noverb:  these may be enough
active:  to aid us in our search
active:  Lestrade laughed
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I am still a sceptic
active:  he said
active:  Theories are all very well
active:  we have
active:  to deal with a hard-headed British jury
noverb:  Nous verrons
active:  answered Holmes calmly
active:  You work your own method
active:  I shall work mine
active:  I shall be busy
noverb:  this afternoon
active:  shall probably return to London by the evening train
noverb:  And leave your case unfinished
noverb:  No
noverb:  finished
noverb:  the mystery
passive: It is solved
active:  was the criminal
noverb:  The gentleman
active:  I describe
active:  is he
active:  Surely it would not be difficult
active:  to find out
active:  This is not such a populous neighbourhood
active:  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders
active:  I am a practical man
active:  he said
active:  and I really cannot undertake
active:  to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg
active:  I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard
noverb:  All right
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  I have given you the chance
active:  Here are your lodgings
noverb:  Good-bye
noverb:  I shall drop you a line
active:  I leave
active:  Having left Lestrade at his rooms
active:  we drove to our hotel
active:  we found lunch upon the table
active:  Holmes was silent
active:  buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face
noverb:  as one
active:  finds himself in a perplexing position
noverb:  Look here
noverb:  Watson
active:  he said
passive: the cloth was cleared
active:  just sit down in this chair
noverb:  let me preach to
noverb:  you for a little
noverb:  I don't know quite
active:  to do
active:  I should value your advice
active:  Light a cigar
noverb:  let me expound
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  now
active:  considering this case
active:  there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative
active:  struck us
active:  they impressed me in his favour and you against him
active:  One was the fact
active:  his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee
active:  seeing him
active:  The other was his singular dying reference to a rat
active:  He mumbled several words
active:  you understand
active:  was all
active:  caught the son's ear
noverb:  Now from this double point
active:  our research must commence
active:  we will begin it
active:  presuming
active:  the lad says
active:  is absolutely true
noverb:  of this 'Cooee
noverb:  Well,
passive: obviously it could not have been meant for the son
noverb:  The son
active:  he knew
active:  was in Bristol
active:  It was mere chance
active:  he was within earshot
noverb:  The 'Cooee
passive: was meant
active:  to attract the attention of whoever it was
active:  he had the appointment with
noverb:  But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry
noverb:  one
passive: is used between Australians
active:  There is a strong presumption
noverb:  that the person
novoice: McCarthy expected
active:  to meet
active:  him at Boscombe Pool was someone
noverb:  who had been in Australia
noverb:  of the rat
active:  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket
active:  flattened it out on the table
active:  This is a map of the Colony of Victoria
active:  he said
active:  I wired to Bristol for it last night
active:  He put his hand over part of the map
noverb:  do you read
noverb:  ARAT
active:  I read
noverb:  And now
active:  He raised his hand
noverb:  BALLARAT
noverb:  Quite
active:  That was the word
novoice: the man uttered
noverb:  of
noverb:  his son only caught the last two syllables
active:  He was trying to utter the name of his murderer
noverb:  of Ballarat
active:  It is wonderful
active:  I exclaimed
active:  It is obvious
noverb:  And now
noverb:  you see
active:  I had narrowed the field down considerably
active:  The possession of a grey garment was a third point
active:  granting the son's statement
active:  to be correct
active:  was a certainty
active:  We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  And one
active:  was at home in the district
passive: for the pool can only be approached by the farm
noverb:  by the estate
active:  strangers could hardly wander
noverb:  Quite
active:  comes our expedition of to-day
active:  By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details
active:  I gave to that imbecile Lestrade
noverb:  as to the personality of the criminal
active:  did you gain them
active:  You know my method
passive: It is founded upon the observation of trifles
noverb:  His height
active:  I know
active:  you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
noverb:  His boots
noverb:  too
active:  might be told from their traces
noverb:  Yes
active:  they were peculiar boots
noverb:  his lameness
active:  The impression of his right foot was always less distinct
noverb:  his left
active:  He put
noverb:  weight upon it
active:  he limped
active:  he was lame
noverb:  his left-handedness
noverb:  You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury
passive: recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
passive: The blow was struck from immediately behind
active:  was upon the left side
noverb:  Now,
active:  can
active:  be
active:  it were by a left-handed man
active:  He had stood behind
noverb:  tree during the interview between the father and son
active:  He had even smoked there
active:  I found the ash of a cigar
active:  my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me
active:  to pronounce as an Indian cigar
active:  I have
active:  you know
active:  devoted some attention to this
active:  written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco
active:  Having found the ash
noverb:  I
active:  looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
active:  he had tossed it
active:  It was an Indian cigar
noverb:  of the variety
passive: are rolled in Rotterdam
noverb:  And the cigar-holder?
active:  I could see
active:  the end had not been in his mouth
active:  Therefore he used a holder
passive: The tip had been cut off
active:  not bitten off
noverb:  the cut was not a clean one
active:  I deduced a blunt pen-knife
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I said
noverb:  you have drawn a net round this man from
active:  he cannot escape
active:  you have saved an innocent human life
active:  you had cut the cord
active:  was hanging him
active:  I see the direction in
noverb:  all this points
active:  The culprit is
noverb:  Mr. John Turner
active:  cried the hotel waiter
active:  opening the door of our sitting-room
active:  ushering in a visitor
noverb:  The man
active:  entered
active:  was a strange and impressive figure
noverb:  His slow
noverb:  limping step
active:  bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude
noverb:  his hard, deep-lined, craggy features
active:  his enormous limbs showed
passive: he was possessed of unusual strength of body
noverb:  of character
noverb:  His tangled beard
noverb:  grizzled hair
noverb:  outstanding
active:  drooping eyebrows combined
active:  to give an air of dignity
noverb:  power to his appearance
active:  his face was of an ashen white
noverb:  his lips
passive: the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
active:  It was clear
noverb:  to me at a glance
active:  he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
active:  Pray
active:  sit down on the sofa
active:  said Holmes gently
active:  You had my note
noverb:  Yes
active:  the lodge-keeper brought it up
active:  You said
noverb:  you wished to see me here
active:  to avoid scandal
active:  I thought people
active:  would talk
active:  I went to the Hall
noverb:  And
noverb:  did you wish
active:  to see me
active:  He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes
noverb:  as

noverb:  Yes
active:  said Holmes
active:  answering the look rather
noverb:  the words
active:  It is
active:  I know all about McCarthy
active:  The old man sank his face in his hands
active:  God help me
active:  he cried
active:  But I would not have let the young man
active:  come
active:  to harm
noverb:  I give you my word
active:  I would have spoken out
active:  it went against him at the Assizes
active:  I am glad
active:  to hear
active:  you say
active:  said Holmes gravely
noverb:  I
active:  would have spoken now
active:  had it not been for my dear girl
active:  It would break her heart
active:  it will break her heart
active:  she hears
passive: I am arrested
active:  It may not come to that
active:  said Holmes
active:  I am no official agent
active:  I understand
active:  it was your daughter
noverb:  who required my presence here
active:  I am acting in her interests
active:  Young McCarthy must be
active:  got off
noverb:  however
active:  I am a dying man
active:  said old Turner
active:  I have had diabetes for years
active:  My doctor says
active:  it is a question
noverb:  whether I shall live a month
active:  Yet I would rather die under my own roof
noverb:  in a gaol
active:  Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper
noverb:  him
noverb:  Just tell us the truth
active:  he said
active:  I shall jot down the facts
active:  You will sign it
active:  Watson here can witness it
active:  Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity
active:  to save young McCarthy
active:  I promise you
active:  I shall not use it
passive: it is absolutely needed
active:  It's as well
active:  said the old man
active:  it's a question
active:  I shall live to the Assizes
active:  it matters little to me
active:  I should wish
noverb:  to spare Alice the shock
active:  And now I will make the thing clear
noverb:  to you
active:  it has been a long time in the acting
noverb:  will not take me long
active:  to tell
noverb:  You didn't know this dead man
noverb:  McCarthy
active:  He was a devil incarnate
noverb:  I tell you that
active:  God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he
active:  His grip has been upon me these twenty years
active:  he has blasted my life
noverb:  I'll tell you first

active:  You must assert
noverb:  in such words
active:  will carry conviction with them
active:  Having done this
active:  you must at once put the box out upon the sundial
passive: directed
active:  Do you understand
noverb:  Entirely
active:  Do not think of revenge
noverb:  anything of the sort
noverb:  at present
active:  I think
active:  we may gain
noverb:  by means of the law
active:  we have our web
active:  to weave
passive: theirs is already woven
active:  The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger
active:  threatens you
active:  The second is
active:  to clear up the mystery
active:  to punish the guilty parties
active:  I thank you
active:  said the young man
noverb:  rising
noverb:  pulling on his overcoat
active:  You have given me fresh life and hope
active:  I shall certainly do
active:  you advise
active:  Do not lose an instant
noverb:  And,
noverb:  above all
noverb:  take care of yourself in the meanwhile
noverb:  for I do not think
active:  there can be a doubt
noverb:  that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
active:  do you go back
noverb:  By train from Waterloo
active:  It is not
noverb:  nine
passive: The streets will be crowded
active:  I trust
active:  you may be in safety
noverb:  And
active:  you cannot guard yourself too closely
passive: I am armed
active:  That is well
active:  To-morrow I shall set
active:  to work upon your case
active:  I shall see you at Horsham
noverb:  No
noverb:  your secret lies in London
active:  It is there
noverb:  that I shall seek it
active:  I shall call upon
noverb:  you in a day
noverb:  in two days
noverb:  with news as to the box and the papers
active:  I shall take your advice in every particular
active:  He shook hands with us
active:  took his leave
novoice: Outside the wind still screamed
active:  the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
active:  This strange, wild story seemed
active:  to have come to us from amid the mad elements
noverb:  blown in upon us
noverb:  a sheet of sea-weed in a gale
noverb:  now
passive: to have
passive: been reabsorbed by them once
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence
noverb:  with his head sunk forward
active:  his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
active:  he lit his pipe
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  he watched the blue smoke-rings
noverb:  as they chased each other up to the ceiling
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  he remarked at last
noverb:  of all our cases
active:  we have had none more fantastic
noverb:  than this
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  the Sign of Four
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
noverb:  Save
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  that
noverb:  And
active:  this John Openshaw seems to me
active:  to be walking amid even greater perils
active:  did the Sholtos
active:  have you
active:  I asked
active:  formed any definite conception as to
active:  these perils are
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  as to their nature
active:  he answered
active:  are they
active:  is this K. K. K.
active:  does he pursue this unhappy family
active:  Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes
active:  placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair
noverb:  with his finger-tips together
noverb:  The ideal reasoner
active:  he remarked
active:  would
active:  he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings
active:  deduce from it not only all the chain of events
novoice: led up to it
noverb:  also all the results
active:  would follow from
noverb:  it
active:  As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone
noverb:  the observer
active:  has thoroughly understood
active:  one link in a series of incidents should be able
active:  to accurately state all the other ones
noverb:  after
active:  We have not yet grasped the results
active:  the reason alone can attain to
passive: Problems may be solved in the study
active:  have baffled all those
active:  have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
active:  To carry the art
noverb:  however, to its highest pitch,
active:  it is necessary
noverb:  that the reasoner should be able
active:  to utilise all the facts
active:  have come to his knowledge
active:  and this in itself implies
noverb:  as you will readily see
noverb:  a possession of all knowledge
noverb:  even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias
active:  is a somewhat rare accomplishment
active:  It is not
noverb:  impossible
noverb:  however
active:  a man should possess all knowledge
active:  is likely
active:  to be useful to him in his work
noverb:  this
active:  I have endeavoured in my case
active:  to do
active:  If I remember rightly
active:  you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion
noverb:  Yes
active:  I answered
noverb:  laughing
active:  It was a singular document
noverb:  Philosophy
noverb:  astronomy

active:  I remember
noverb:  Botany variable
noverb:  geology profound as regards
noverb:  the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town

noverb:  anatomy unsystematic
noverb:  , sensational literature
noverb:  crime records unique, violin-player, boxer
noverb:  swordsman
noverb:  lawyer
noverb:  self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
noverb:  Those
active:  I think
active:  were the main points of my analysis
active:  Holmes grinned at the last item
noverb:  Well
active:  he said
active:  I say now
noverb:  as I said
active:  a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture
active:  he is likely
active:  to use
noverb:  the rest
active:  he can put away in the lumber-room of his library
active:  he can get it
active:  he wants it
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  for such a case as the one
passive: has been submitted to us to-night
active:  we need certainly to muster all our resources
noverb:  Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia
noverb:  stands upon the shelf beside you
active:  Thank you
noverb:  Now let us consider the situation
noverb:  see
passive: may be deduced from
noverb:  it
noverb:  In the first place
active:  we may start with a strong presumption
active:  Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America
active:  Men at his time of life do not change all their habits
noverb:  exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town
active:  His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea
active:  he was in fear of someone
noverb:  something
active:  we may assume as a working hypothesis
active:  it was fear of someone or something
noverb:  which drove him from America
noverb:  As to
noverb:  it was he feared
active:  we can only deduce
active:  considering the formidable letters
passive: were received by himself and his successors
active:  Did you remark the postmarks of those letters
active:  The first was from Pondicherry
noverb:  the second from Dundee
noverb:  the third from London
noverb:  From East London
active:  do you deduce from that
active:  They are all seaports
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We have already a clue
active:  There can be no doubt
noverb:  that the probability--the strong probability--is
active:  the writer was on board of a ship
noverb:  And now let us consider another point
noverb:  In the case of Pondicherry
active:  seven weeks elapsed between the threat
noverb:  its fulfilment
noverb:  in Dundee
active:  it was only some three
noverb:  four days
active:  Does
active:  suggest anything
noverb:  A greater distance
active:  to travel
active:  the letter had also a greater distance
active:  to come
active:  I do not see the point
active:  There is at least a presumption
noverb:  that the vessel in
noverb:  the man
active:  men are
active:  is a sailing-ship
active:  It looks as
active:  they always send their singular warning
noverb:  token
noverb:  them
noverb:  starting upon their mission
active:  You see
active:  quickly the deed followed the sign
active:  it came from Dundee
active:  they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer
active:  they would have arrived almost
noverb:  their letter
active:  , as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed
active:  I think
active:  those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat
active:  brought the letter
noverb:  the sailing vessel
active:  brought the writer
active:  It is possible
noverb:  More than that
active:  It is probable
active:  And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case
active:  I urged young Openshaw
active:  to caution
active:  The blow has always fallen at the end of the time
active:  it would take the senders
active:  to travel the distance
active:  this one comes from London
active:  therefore we cannot count upon delay
noverb:  Good God
active:  I cried
active:  can it mean
noverb:  this relentless persecution
noverb:  The papers
active:  Openshaw carried
active:  are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship
active:  I think
active:  it is quite clear
noverb:  that there must be more than one of them
active:  A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as
active:  to deceive a coroner's jury
active:  There must have been several in it
active:  they must have been men of resource and determination
noverb:  Their papers they mean to have
active:  be the holder of them
active:  it may
active:  In this way you see K. K. K.
active:  ceases to be the initials of an individual
active:  becomes the badge of a society
noverb:  of
noverb:  society
active:  Have you never
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  bending forward
active:  sinking his voice
active:  have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan
active:  I never have
active:  Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
noverb:  Here it is
active:  said he presently
noverb:  Ku Klux Klan
passive: A name derived
novoice: from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced
active:  cocking a rifle
active:  This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War
noverb:  it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country
noverb:  notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida
passive: Its power was used for political purposes
noverb:  principally for the terrorising of the negro voters
noverb:  the murdering and driving from the country of those
passive: were opposed to its views
passive: Its outrages were usually preceded
novoice: by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
noverb:  generally recognised shape
noverb:  a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts
noverb:  melon seeds
noverb:  orange pips in others
active:  receiving this the victim
active:  might
active:  openly abjure his former ways
active:  might fly from the country
active:  he braved the matter out
active:  death would unfailingly come upon him
noverb:  usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
active:  perfect was the organisation of the society
noverb:  so systematic its methods
active:  there is hardly a case
noverb:  upon record
novoice: any man succeeded in braving it with impunity
noverb:  in
passive: any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
active:  For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government
noverb:  of the better classes of the community in the South
noverb:  Eventually,
noverb:  in the year 1869
noverb:  the movement rather suddenly collapsed
active:  there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort
noverb:  date
active:  You will observe
active:  said Holmes
active:  laying down the volume
noverb:  the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers
active:  It may well
active:  have been cause and effect
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that he
active:  his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
active:  You can understand
noverb:  this register
active:  diary may implicate some of the first men in the South
active:  there may be many
noverb:  who will not sleep easy at night
passive: it is recovered
noverb:  the page
active:  we have seen
active:  Is such as
active:  we might expect
active:  It ran
active:  I remember right
active:  sent the pips to A
noverb:  B
noverb:  C
active:  that is
active:  sent the society's warning to them
active:  there are successive entries
noverb:  A
novoice: B cleared
active:  left the country
noverb:  finally
passive: C was visited
noverb:  with
active:  I fear
noverb:  a sinister result for C. Well
active:  I think
noverb:  Doctor
active:  we may let some light into this dark place
active:  I believe
active:  the only chance young Openshaw has
active:  in the meantime is to do
active:  I have told him
active:  There is nothing
noverb:  more
passive: to be said
active:  to be done to-night
active:  hand me over my violin
noverb:  let us try
active:  to forget for half an hour the miserable weather
noverb:  the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
active:  It had cleared in the morning
active:  the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil
noverb:  hangs over the great city
active:  Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast
active:  I came down
active:  You will excuse me for not waiting for
noverb:  you
active:  said he
active:  I have
active:  I foresee
noverb:  a very busy day
noverb:  me
active:  looking into this case of young Openshaw's
noverb:  steps will you take
active:  I asked
active:  It will very much
active:  depend upon the results of my first inquiries
active:  I may have
active:  to go down to Horsham
noverb:  after all
noverb:  You will not go there first
noverb:  No
active:  I shall commence with the City
active:  Just ring the bell
active:  the maid will bring up your coffee
active:  I waited
active:  I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table
active:  glanced my eye over it
active:  It rested upon a heading
active:  sent a chill to my heart
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  you are too late
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  laying down his cup
active:  I feared as much
passive: was it done
active:  He spoke calmly
active:  I could see
passive: he was deeply moved
active:  My eye caught the name of Openshaw
noverb:  the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge
active:  Here is the account
noverb:  Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge
active:  heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
noverb:  The night
noverb:  however
active:  was extremely dark and stormy
noverb:  in spite of the help of several passers-by
active:  it was quite impossible
active:  to effect a rescue
noverb:  The alarm
noverb:  however
active:  was given
noverb:  by the aid of the water-police
passive: the body was eventually recovered
active:  It proved to be
noverb:  of a young gentleman
noverb:  name
active:  it appears from an envelope
passive: was found in his pocket
active:  was John Openshaw
active:  residence is near Horsham
passive: It is conjectured
active:  he may have been hurrying down
active:  to catch the last train from Waterloo Station
noverb:  in his haste
noverb:  the extreme darkness
active:  he missed his path
active:  walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats
active:  The body exhibited no traces of violence
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
active:  should have the effect
active:  calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages
active:  We sat in silence for some minutes
noverb:  Holmes more depressed and shaken
noverb:  than I had ever seen him
active:  That hurts my pride, Watson
active:  he said at last
active:  It is a petty feeling
noverb:  no doubt
active:  it hurts my pride
active:  It becomes a personal matter with me now
noverb:  God sends me health
active:  I shall set my hand upon this gang
active:  he should come to me for help
active:  I should send him away to his death
noverb:  !
active:  He sprang from his chair
active:  paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation
active:  with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
active:  They must be cunning devils
active:  he exclaimed at last
active:  could
active:  they have decoyed him down there
active:  The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station
noverb:  The bridge, no doubt
active:  was too crowded
noverb:  even on such a night
noverb:  for their purpose
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall see
active:  will win in the long run
active:  I am going out now
noverb:  To the police
noverb:  No
active:  I shall be my own police
active:  When I have spun the web
active:  they may take the flies
noverb:  not before
noverb:  All day
passive: I was engaged in my professional work
active:  it was late
noverb:  in the evening
active:  I returned to Baker Street
active:  Sherlock Holmes had not come back
active:  It was nearly ten
noverb:  o'clock
active:  he entered
noverb:  looking pale
noverb:  worn
active:  He walked up to the sideboard
active:  tearing a piece from the loaf
active:  he devoured it voraciously
active:  washing it down with a long draught of water
active:  You are hungry
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Starving
active:  It had escaped my memory
active:  I have had nothing
noverb:  breakfast
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  Not a bite
active:  I had no time
active:  to think of
noverb:  it
noverb:  And
active:  have you succeeded
noverb:  Well
active:  You have a clue
active:  I have them in the hollow of my hand
active:  Young Openshaw shall not long
active:  remain unavenged
noverb:  Watson
novoice: let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them
active:  It is well thought of
noverb:  do you mean
active:  He took an orange from the cupboard
active:  tearing it to pieces
active:  he squeezed out the pips upon the table
noverb:  Of these he took five
novoice: thrust them into an envelope
noverb:  On the inside of the flap
active:  he wrote
noverb:  S. H. for J. O.
active:  he sealed it
active:  addressed it to
noverb:  Captain James Calhoun
noverb:  Barque Lone Star
noverb:  Savannah, Georgia
active:  That will await him
active:  he enters port
active:  said he
active:  chuckling
noverb:  It may give him a sleepless night
active:  He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate
active:  Openshaw did
noverb:  him
noverb:  And
noverb:  who is this Captain Calhoun
noverb:  The leader of the gang
active:  I shall have the others
noverb:  he first
active:  did you trace it
active:  He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket
noverb:  all covered with dates and names
active:  I have spent the whole day
active:  said he
noverb:  over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers
active:  following the future career of every vessel
active:  touched at Pondicherry in January
noverb:  February in '83
active:  There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage
active:  were reported there during those months
noverb:  Of these
noverb:  one
noverb:  the Lone Star
active:  attracted my attention
passive: it was reported
active:  having cleared from London
active:  the name is
passive: is given to one of the states of the Union
noverb:  Texas
active:  I think
active:  I was not
active:  am not sure
active:  I knew
active:  the ship must have an American origin
active:  I searched the Dundee records
active:  I found
active:  the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85
active:  my suspicion became a certainty
noverb:  I
novoice: inquired as to the vessels
active:  lay at present in the port of London
noverb:  Yes

active:  has been loading their cargo
noverb:  By the time
noverb:  their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter
active:  the cable will have informed the police of Savannah
passive: these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
active:  There is
noverb:  a flaw
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the best laid of human plans
active:  the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips
active:  would show them
noverb:  another
noverb:  as cunning
noverb:  themselves
active:  was upon their track
noverb:  Very long
noverb:  very severe were the equinoctial gales that year

noverb:  I would send him home in a cab within two hours
active:  he were indeed at the address
active:  she had given me
noverb:  And
noverb:  in ten minutes
active:  I had left my armchair
noverb:  cheery sitting-room behind me
active:  was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand
novoice: it seemed to me at the time
active:  the future only could show
noverb:  strange it was
active:  to be
active:  there was no great difficulty
noverb:  in the first stage of my adventure
noverb:  Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
active:  line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge
noverb:  Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop
passive: approached
active:  by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap
noverb:  the mouth of a cave
active:  I found the den of
active:  I was in search
noverb:  Ordering my cab
active:  to wait
active:  I passed down the steps
noverb:  worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet
active:  and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
noverb:  made my way into a long, low room
noverb:  thick
noverb:  heavy with the brown opium smoke
novoice: terraced with wooden berths
noverb:  like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
active:  Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies
active:  lying in strange fantastic poses
noverb:  bowed shoulders
noverb:  bent knees
noverb:  heads thrown back
active:  chins pointing upward
noverb:  with here
noverb:  there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer
noverb:  Out of the black shadows
active:  there glimmered little red circles of light
noverb:  now bright
noverb:  now faint
noverb:  as the burning poison waxed
novoice: waned in the bowls of the metal pipes
noverb:  The most lay silent
noverb:  some muttered to themselves
novoice: others talked together in a strange
noverb:  low
noverb:  monotonous voice
noverb:  their conversation coming in gushes
active:  suddenly tailing off into silence
noverb:  each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour
active:  At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal
noverb:  beside
active:  on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall
noverb:  thin old man
active:  with his jaw resting upon his two fists
noverb:  his elbows upon his knees
noverb:  staring into the fire
active:  I entered
active:  a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me
noverb:  a supply of the drug
active:  beckoning me to an empty berth
active:  Thank you
active:  I have not come
active:  to stay
active:  said I.
active:  There is a friend
noverb:  of mine here
noverb:  Mr. Isa Whitney
active:  I wish
active:  to speak with him
active:  There was a movement
noverb:  an exclamation from my right
active:  peering through the gloom
active:  I saw Whitney
noverb:  pale, haggard, and unkempt
active:  staring out at me
noverb:  My God
active:  It's Watson
active:  said he
active:  He was in a pitiable state of reaction
noverb:  with every nerve in a twitter
active:  I say
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  o'clock is it
noverb:  Nearly eleven
noverb:  Of
noverb:  day
noverb:  Of Friday
noverb:  June 19th
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I thought
active:  it was Wednesday
active:  It is Wednesday
noverb:  d'you want
active:  to frighten a chap for
active:  He sank his face onto his arms
active:  began
active:  to sob in a high treble key
active:  I tell you
active:  it is Friday
noverb:  man
active:  Your wife has been waiting this two days for you
active:  You should be ashamed
noverb:  of yourself
active:  I am
noverb:  you've got mixed
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  for I have only been here a few hours
noverb:  three pipes
noverb:  four pipes
active:  I forget
noverb:  many
active:  But I'll go home with you
noverb:  I wouldn't frighten Kate
noverb:  poor little Kate
noverb:  Give me your hand
noverb:  Have you a cab
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have one waiting
active:  I shall go in
noverb:  it
active:  But I must owe something
noverb:  Find
active:  I owe
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am all
noverb:  off colour
active:  I can do nothing for myself
active:  I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers
active:  holding my breath
active:  to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug
noverb:  looking about for the manager
active:  As I passed the tall man
active:  sat by the brazier
active:  I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt
noverb:  a low voice whispered
noverb:  Walk past me
noverb:  look back at me
noverb:  The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
active:  I glanced down
active:  They could only have come from the old man at my side
active:  he sat now
noverb:  very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age
noverb:  an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees
noverb:  as
active:  it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers
active:  I took two steps forward
active:  looked back
active:  It took all my self-control
active:  to prevent me
active:  breaking out into a cry of astonishment
active:  He had turned his back
active:  that none could see him
active:  I. His form had filled out
passive: his wrinkles were gone
active:  the dull eyes had regained their fire
noverb:  there
noverb:  sitting by the fire
noverb:  grinning at my surprise
noverb:  was none other than Sherlock Holmes
active:  He made a slight motion to me
active:  to approach him
noverb:  as he turned his face half round to the company once
novoice: subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I whispered
noverb:  on earth are you doing in this den
active:  you can
active:  he answered
active:  I have excellent ears
active:  you would have the great kindness
active:  to get rid of that sottish friend of yours
active:  I should be exceedingly glad
active:  to have a little talk with you
active:  I have a cab
active:  pray
noverb:  send him home in it
active:  You may safely trust him
noverb:  for he appears to be too limp
active:  to get into any mischief
active:  I should recommend you also
active:  to send a note by the cabman to your wife
active:  to say
active:  you have thrown in your lot with me
active:  you will wait
active:  I shall be with
noverb:  you in five minutes
active:  It was difficult
active:  to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests
noverb:  for they were always
noverb:  exceedingly definite
noverb:  put forward with such a quiet air of mastery
active:  I felt
noverb:  however
active:  Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission
passive: was practically accomplished
noverb:  and for the rest
active:  I could not wish anything better
noverb:  than
passive: to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures
active:  were the normal condition of his existence
active:  In a few minutes I had written my note
active:  paid Whitney's bill
active:  led him out to the cab
noverb:  seen him driven through the darkness
active:  In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
active:  I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes
active:  For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
active:  glancing quickly round
active:  he straightened himself out
noverb:  burst into a hearty fit of laughter
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  you imagine
active:  I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections
noverb:  all the other little weaknesses on
active:  you have favoured me with your medical views
passive: I was certainly surprised
noverb:  to find you there
noverb:  not
noverb:  I
active:  to find you
active:  I came to find a friend
noverb:  And I
active:  to find an enemy
noverb:  An enemy
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  one of my natural enemies
active:  shall I say
noverb:  my natural prey
noverb:  Briefly,
noverb:  Watson
active:  I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry
active:  I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots
active:  I have done
noverb:  now
passive: Had I been recognised in that den my life
noverb:  would not have been worth an hour's purchase
noverb:  for I have used it
noverb:  now for my own purposes
noverb:  the rascally Lascar
active:  runs
active:  it has sworn to have vengeance upon me
active:  There is a trap-door at the back of
noverb:  building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf,
active:  could tell some strange tales of
active:  has passed through
noverb:  it upon the moonless nights
active:  You do not mean bodies
noverb:  Ay,
noverb:  bodies
noverb:  Watson
active:  We should be rich men
active:  we had $1000 for every poor devil
passive: has been done to death in that den
active:  It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside
active:  I fear
active:  Neville St. Clair has entered it never
active:  to leave it
active:  our trap should be here
active:  He put his two forefingers between his teeth
novoice: whistled shrilly
noverb:  a signal
passive: was answered by a similar whistle from the distance
novoice: followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom
active:  throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns
active:  You'll come with me
noverb:  won't you
active:  I can be of use
noverb:  Oh
active:  a trusty comrade is always of use
noverb:  and a chronicler still
active:  My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one
noverb:  The Cedars
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is Mr. St. Clair's house
active:  I am staying there
active:  I conduct the inquiry
active:  Where is it
noverb:  Near Lee
noverb:  in Kent
active:  We have a seven-mile drive
noverb:  us
active:  I am all
noverb:  in the dark
active:  course
active:  you are
active:  You'll know all about it presently
noverb:  Jump up here
noverb:  All right
noverb:  John
active:  we shall not need you
noverb:  Here's half a crown
noverb:  Look out for me to-morrow
noverb:  about eleven
active:  Give her her head
noverb:  long
active:  He flicked the horse with his whip
active:  we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre
noverb:  deserted streets
active:  widened gradually
active:  we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge
noverb:  with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us
noverb:  Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks
noverb:  mortar
noverb:  its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman
noverb:  the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers
active:  A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky
noverb:  a star
novoice: two twinkled dimly here
noverb:  there through the rifts of the clouds
active:  Holmes drove in silence
active:  with his head sunk upon his breast
noverb:  the air of a man
passive: is lost in thought
active:  I sat beside him
noverb:  curious
active:  to learn
active:  this new quest might be
active:  seemed to tax his powers
noverb:  sorely
noverb:  afraid
active:  to break in upon the current of his thoughts
active:  We had driven several miles
active:  were beginning
active:  to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas
active:  he shook himself
active:  shrugged his shoulders
active:  lit up his pipe with the air of a man
active:  has satisfied himself
active:  he is acting for the best
active:  You have a grand gift of silence
noverb:  Watson
active:  said he
active:  It makes you quite invaluable as a companion
noverb:  Pon my word
active:  it is a great thing
noverb:  for me
active:  to have someone
active:  to talk to
active:  for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant
active:  I was wondering
active:  I should say to this dear little woman to-night
active:  she meets me at the door
active:  You forget
active:  I know nothing about it
noverb:  I shall just have time
noverb:  to tell you the facts of the case
active:  we get to Lee
active:  It seems absurdly simple
active:  somehow I can get nothing
active:  to go upon
active:  There's plenty of thread
noverb:  no doubt
noverb:  I can't get the end of it into my hand
noverb:  Now,
active:  I'll state the case clearly
active:  concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark
noverb:  all is dark to me
active:  Proceed
noverb:  Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman
noverb:  Neville St. Clair by name
active:  appeared to have plenty of money
active:  He took a large villa
passive: laid out the grounds very nicely
novoice: lived generally in good style

noverb:  a good husband
noverb:  a very affectionate father
noverb:  a man
noverb:  who is popular
noverb:  with all
active:  know him
active:  I may add
noverb:  his whole debts at the present moment
active:  we have been able
active:  to ascertain
noverb:  amount to $88 10s
active:  he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank
active:  There is no reason
noverb:  therefore
active:  to think
active:  money troubles have been weighing upon his mind
active:  Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
noverb:  usual
active:  remarking
active:  he started
active:  he had two important commissions
active:  to perform
active:  he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  by the merest chance
active:  his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday
noverb:  very shortly after his departure
noverb:  to the effect
noverb:  a small parcel of considerable value
active:  she had been expecting
active:  was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company
noverb:  Now,
active:  you are well up in your London
active:  you will know
active:  the office of the company is in Fresno Street
noverb:  branches out of Upper Swandam Lane
active:  you found me to-night
active:  Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch
novoice: started for the City
active:  did some shopping
novoice: proceeded to the company's office
active:  got her packet
active:  found herself at exactly 4
noverb:  35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station
active:  Have you followed me so far
active:  It is very clear
active:  you remember
active:  Monday was an exceedingly hot day
novoice: Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly
active:  glancing about in the hope
active:  seeing a cab
active:  she did not
noverb:  the neighbourhood in
active:  she found herself
active:  she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane
novoice: she suddenly heard an ejaculation
noverb:  cry
active:  was struck cold
active:  to see her husband looking down at her
novoice: it seemed to her
active:  beckoning to her from a second-floor window
active:  The window was open
active:  she distinctly saw his face
active:  she describes
passive: being terribly agitated
active:  He waved his hands frantically to her
passive: vanished from the window
noverb:  suddenly
active:  it seemed to her
passive: he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
noverb:  One singular point
novoice: struck
active:  her quick feminine eye was
active:  he wore some dark coat
noverb:  such as he had started to town in
active:  he had on
noverb:  collar nor necktie
active:  Convinced
active:  something was amiss with him
active:  she rushed down the steps
noverb:  for the house was none other than the opium den in
active:  you found me to-night
noverb:  running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs
active:  led to the first floor
noverb:  At the foot of the stairs
noverb:  however
active:  she met this Lascar scoundrel of
active:  I have spoken
active:  thrust her back
passive: aided by a Dane
noverb:  acts as assistant there
active:  pushed her out into the street
passive: Filled with the most maddening doubts
noverb:  fears
active:  she rushed down the lane
noverb:  by rare good-fortune
active:  met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector
noverb:  all on their way to their beat
noverb:  The inspector
active:  two men accompanied her back
noverb:  in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor
active:  they made their way to the room in
active:  Mr. St. Clair had last
passive: been seen
noverb:  There was no sign of him there
noverb:  In fact
noverb:  in the whole of
active:  floor
active:  there was no one
noverb:  to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect
active:  it seems
noverb:  made his home there
noverb:  he
active:  the Lascar stoutly swore
active:  no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon
noverb:  determined was their denial
passive: the inspector was staggered
active:  had almost come to believe
passive: Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded
active:  , with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
noverb:  lay upon the table
active:  tore the lid from it
active:  Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks
active:  It was the toy
noverb:  which he had promised to bring home
noverb:  This discovery
noverb:  the evident confusion
active:  the cripple showed
active:  made the inspector
active:  realise
active:  the matter was serious
passive: The rooms were carefully examined
noverb:  results all pointed to an abominable crime
passive: The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom
active:  looked out upon the back of one of the wharves
active:  Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip
active:  is dry at low tide
passive: is covered at high tide with at least four
noverb:  a half feet of water
noverb:  The bedroom window was a broad one
novoice: opened from below
active:  On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
active:  several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom
noverb:  Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  with the exception of his coat
noverb:  His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch
noverb:  all were there
active:  There were no signs
noverb:  of violence upon any of these garments
active:  there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  Out of the window he must apparently have gone
passive: for no other exit could be discovered
active:  the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise
active:  he could save himself by swimming
active:  for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
noverb:  And now as to the villains
active:  seemed
passive: to be immediately implicated in the matter
passive: The Lascar was known
active:  to be a man of the vilest antecedents
noverb:  as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known
novoice: to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window
active:  he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime
active:  His defence was one of absolute ignorance
active:  he protested
active:  he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone
noverb:  his lodger
active:  he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes
noverb:  much for the Lascar manager
noverb:  Now for the sinister cripple
noverb:  lives upon the second floor of the opium den
active:  was certainly the last human being
active:  eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair
active:  His name is Hugh Boone
active:  his hideous face is one
active:  is familiar to every man
active:  goes much to the City
active:  He is a professional beggar
noverb:  in order
active:  to avoid the police regulations
active:  he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas
noverb:  Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is
noverb:  as you may have remarked
noverb:  a small angle in the wall
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  this creature takes his daily seat
noverb:  cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap
active:  he is a piteous spectacle
active:  a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap
noverb:  lies upon the pavement beside him
active:  I have watched the fellow more than once
noverb:  I thought
active:  making his professional acquaintance
passive: I have been surprised at the harvest
active:  he has reaped in a short time
noverb:  His appearance
noverb:  you see
active:  is so remarkable
active:  no one can pass him
active:  observing him
noverb:  A shock of orange hair
passive: a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar
active:  , by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip
noverb:  a bulldog chin
noverb:  a pair of very penetrating dark eyes
active:  present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair
noverb:  all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants
noverb:  too
active:  does his wit
noverb:  for he is
noverb:  ready with a reply to any piece of chaff
passive: may be thrown at him by the passers-by
active:  This is the man
active:  we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den
active:  to have been the last man
active:  to see the gentleman of
active:  we are in quest
noverb:  a cripple
active:  said I.
active:  could
active:  he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life
active:  He is a cripple
noverb:  in the sense
active:  he walks with a limp
noverb:  in other respects
active:  he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man
active:  Surely your medical experience would tell you
noverb:  Watson
passive: weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
active:  Pray
active:  continue your narrative
active:  Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window
passive: she was escorted home in a cab by the police
active:  as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
noverb:  Inspector Barton
active:  had charge of the case
active:  made a very careful examination of the premises
noverb:  without finding anything
active:  threw any light upon the matter
passive: One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone
passive: he was allowed some few minutes during
active:  he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar
passive: this fault was soon remedied
passive: he was seized and searched
passive: without anything being found
active:  could incriminate him
active:  There were
active:  it is true
noverb:  , some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve
noverb:  ,
active:  he pointed to his ring-finger
passive: had been cut near the nail
active:  explained
active:  the bleeding came from there
active:  adding
active:  he had been to the window not long before
noverb:  the stains
active:  had been observed there
active:  came doubtless from the same source
noverb:  He
active:  denied strenuously
novoice: having
noverb:  seen Mr. Neville St. Clair
active:  swore
active:  the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police
noverb:  As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion
active:  she had actually seen her husband at the window
active:  he declared
active:  she must have been
noverb:  mad
noverb:  dreaming
passive: He was removed
passive: loudly protesting
noverb:  to the police-station
active:  the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope
active:  the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
active:  And it did
passive: they hardly found upon the mud-bank
active:  they had feared
active:  to find
active:  It was Neville St. Clair's coat
noverb:  not Neville St. Clair
active:  lay uncovered
active:  the tide receded
noverb:  And
active:  do you think
passive: they found in the pockets
active:  I cannot imagine
noverb:  No
noverb:  I don't think
active:  you would guess
active:  Every pocket stuffed with pennies
noverb:  half-pennies
noverb:  421 pennies and 270 half-pennies
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that it had not been swept away by the tide
active:  a human body is a different matter
active:  There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house
active:  It seemed likely enough
active:  the weighted coat had remained
passive: the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
active:  I understand
passive: all the other clothes were found in the room
active:  Would the body
passive: be dressed in a coat alone
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
passive: the facts might be met speciously enough
active:  Suppose
active:  this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window
active:  there is no human eye
active:  could have seen the deed
active:  would
active:  he do
active:  It would of course
active:  strike him
active:  he must get rid of the tell-tale garments
active:  He would seize the coat
active:  be in the act
active:  throwing it out
active:  it would occur to him
active:  it would swim
noverb:  not sink
active:  He has little time
noverb:  for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
novoice: the wife tried
active:  to force her way up
active:  perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate
active:  the police are hurrying up the street
active:  There is not an instant
passive: to be lost
active:  He rushes to some secret hoard
active:  he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary
active:  he stuffs all the coins upon
active:  he can lay his hands into the pockets
active:  to make sure of the coat's sinking
active:  He throws it out
active:  would have done the same with the other garments
active:  had not he heard the rush of steps below
noverb:  only just had time
active:  to close the window
active:  the police appeared
active:  It certainly sounds feasible
noverb:  Well,
active:  we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better
noverb:  Boone
active:  I have told you
passive: was arrested and taken to the station
passive: it could not be shown
active:  there had
active:  been anything against him
active:  He had
passive: for years been known as a professional beggar
novoice: his life appeared
active:  to have been a very quiet
noverb:  innocent one
noverb:  There the matter stands at present
noverb:  the questions
active:  have to be solved
active:  --what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as
active:  I confess
active:  I cannot recall any case within my experience
active:  looked at the first glance
noverb:  simple
noverb:  yet
active:  presented such difficulties
active:  Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events
active:  we had been whirling
passive: through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind
active:  we rattled along with a country hedge upon
noverb:  side of us
noverb:  Just as he finished
noverb:  however
active:  we drove through two scattered villages
active:  a few lights still glimmered in the windows
active:  We are on the outskirts of Lee
active:  said my companion
active:  We have touched on three English counties in our short drive
noverb:  starting in Middlesex
noverb:  passing over an angle of Surrey
noverb:  ending in Kent
noverb:  See
active:  light among the trees
active:  That is The Cedars
active:  beside that lamp sits a woman
passive: anxious ears have already
active:  I have little doubt
active:  caught the clink of our horse's feet
active:  are you not conducting the case from Baker Street
active:  I asked
active:  there are many inquiries
passive: must be made out here
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal
active:  you may rest assured
active:  she will have nothing
noverb:  a welcome for my friend and colleague
active:  I hate to meet her
noverb:  Watson
active:  I have no news of her husband
noverb:  Here we are
noverb:  Whoa
noverb:  there
noverb:  whoa
active:  We had pulled up in front of a large villa
novoice: stood within its own grounds
active:  A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head
active:  springing down
active:  I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
active:  led to the house
active:  we approached
active:  the door flew open
novoice: a little blonde woman stood in the opening
noverb:  clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie
noverb:  with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists
active:  She stood
novoice: with her figure outlined against the flood of light
noverb:  one hand upon the door
noverb:  one half-raised in her eagerness
noverb:  her body slightly bent
noverb:  , her head
novoice: face protruded
noverb:  with eager eyes
noverb:  parted lips
noverb:  a standing question
noverb:  Well
active:  she cried
noverb:  well
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  there were two of us
noverb:  , she gave a cry of hope
active:  sank into a groan as she
active:  saw
active:  my companion shook his head
active:  shrugged his shoulders
noverb:  No good news
noverb:  None
noverb:  No bad
noverb:  No
noverb:  Thank God for that
active:  come in
active:  You must be weary
noverb:  , for you have had a long day
active:  This is my friend, Dr. Watson
active:  He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases
active:  a lucky chance has made it possible for me
active:  to bring him out
active:  associate him with this investigation
passive: I am delighted
active:  to see you
active:  said she
active:  pressing my hand warmly
active:  You will
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , forgive anything
active:  may be wanting in our arrangements
active:  you consider the blow
active:  has come
noverb:  suddenly upon us
noverb:  My dear madam
active:  said I
active:  I am an old campaigner
active:  I were not
active:  I can very well see
passive: no apology is needed
active:  If I can be of any assistance
noverb:  to you
noverb:  to my friend here
active:  I shall be indeed happy
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  said the lady
active:  we entered a well-lit dining-room
noverb:  upon the table of
passive: a cold supper had been laid out
active:  I should very much
noverb:  like to ask you one or two plain questions
noverb:  to
active:  I beg
active:  you will give a plain answer
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  madam
active:  Do not trouble about my feelings
active:  I am not hysterical
noverb:  ,
noverb:  given
active:  to fainting
active:  I simply wish to hear your real
noverb:  real opinion
noverb:  Upon
noverb:  point
noverb:  In your heart of hearts
active:  do you think
active:  Neville is alive
active:  Sherlock Holmes seemed
passive: to be embarrassed by the question
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  now
active:  she repeated
noverb:  standing upon the rug
noverb:  looking keenly down at him
active:  he leaned back in a basket-chair
noverb:  Frankly,
noverb:  madam
active:  I do not
active:  You think
active:  he is dead
active:  I do
noverb:  Murdered
noverb:  I don't say that
noverb:  Perhaps
noverb:  And on
noverb:  day did he meet his death
noverb:  On Monday
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you will be good enough
active:  to explain
active:  it is
active:  I have received a letter from him to-day
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as
passive: he had been galvanised
active:  he roared
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  to-day
active:  She stood smiling
active:  holding up a little slip of paper in the air
active:  May I see it
noverb:  Certainly
active:  He snatched it from her in his eagerness
active:  smoothing it out upon the table
active:  he drew over the lamp
active:  examined it intently
active:  I had left my chair
active:  was gazing at it over his shoulder
noverb:  The envelope was a very coarse one
passive: was stamped with the Gravesend postmark
noverb:  with the date of that very day
noverb:  rather of the day before
active:  for it was considerably after midnight
noverb:  Coarse writing
active:  murmured Holmes
active:  Surely this is not your husband's writing
noverb:  madam
noverb:  No
active:  the enclosure is
active:  I perceive also
active:  whoever addressed the envelope
passive: had
active:  to go and inquire as to the address
active:  can you tell that
noverb:  The name
noverb:  you see
active:  is in perfectly black ink
active:  has dried itself
active:  The rest is of the greyish colour
active:  shows
noverb:  blotting-paper has been used
passive: it had been written straight off
novoice: blotted
active:  none would be of a deep black shade
active:  This man has written the name
active:  there has
active:  been a pause
active:  he wrote the address
active:  can only mean
active:  he was not familiar
noverb:  with it
active:  It is, of course, a trifle
active:  there is nothing
noverb:  so important as trifles
noverb:  Let us now see the letter
noverb:  Ha! there has been an enclosure here
noverb:  Yes
active:  there was a ring
noverb:  His signet-ring
active:  And you are sure
active:  this is your husband's hand
noverb:  One of his hands
noverb:  One
noverb:  His hand
active:  he wrote hurriedly
active:  It is very unlike his usual writing
noverb:  I know it well
active:  Dearest do not
passive: be frightened
noverb:  All will come well
active:  There is a huge error
noverb:  which it may take some little time
active:  to rectify
noverb:  Wait in patience
noverb:  NEVILLE
passive: Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark
noverb:  Hum
active:  Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb
noverb:  Ha
passive: And the flap has been gummed
active:  I am not very much
noverb:  in error
noverb:  by a person
active:  had been chewing tobacco
active:  And you have no doubt
active:  it is your husband's hand, madam
noverb:  None
active:  Neville wrote those words
active:  And they were posted to-day at Gravesend
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mrs. St. Clair
active:  the clouds lighten
active:  I should not venture to say
active:  the danger is over
active:  he must be alive
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  this is a clever forgery
active:  to put us on the wrong scent
active:  The ring, after all, proves nothing
passive: It may have been taken from him
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  it is
active:  it is his very own writing
noverb:  Very well
active:  It may
noverb:  however
passive: have been written on Monday
active:  only posted to-day
active:  That is possible
active:  much may have happened between
noverb:  Oh
active:  you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes
active:  I know
noverb:  all is well with him
active:  There is so keen
noverb:  a sympathy between us
active:  I should know
active:  evil came upon him
noverb:  On the very day
noverb:  I saw him last
active:  he cut himself in the bedroom
noverb:  I in the dining-room rushed upstairs
noverb:  with the utmost certainty
active:  something had happened
active:  Do you think
active:  I would respond to such a trifle
active:  be ignorant of his death
active:  I have seen too much not to know
active:  the impression of a woman may be more valuable
noverb:  the conclusion of an analytical reasoner
active:  And in this letter
active:  you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence
active:  to corroborate your view
active:  your husband is alive and able
active:  to write letters
active:  should he remain away from
noverb:  you
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  It is unthinkable
active:  And on Monday he made no remarks
active:  leaving you
noverb:  No
passive: And you were surprised
active:  to see him in Swandam Lane
noverb:  Very much
active:  Was the window open
noverb:  Yes
active:  he might have called to
noverb:  you
active:  He might
noverb:  He only
active:  I understand
active:  gave an inarticulate cry
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  A call for help
active:  you thought
noverb:  Yes
active:  He waved his hands
active:  it might have been a cry of surprise
active:  Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him
active:  to throw up his hands
active:  It is possible
active:  And you thought
passive: he was pulled back
active:  He disappeared
noverb:  suddenly
active:  He might have leaped back
active:  You did not see anyone else in the room
noverb:  No
active:  this horrible man confessed
active:  to having been there
active:  the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  Your husband
active:  you could see
active:  had his ordinary clothes on
noverb:  without his collar or tie
active:  I distinctly saw his bare throat
active:  Had he
noverb:  spoken of Swandam Lane
noverb:  Never
active:  Had he ever showed any signs
active:  having taken opium
noverb:  Never
active:  Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair
noverb:  Those are the principal points about
active:  I wished to be absolutely clear
active:  We shall
active:  now have a little supper
noverb:  retire
noverb:  for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
noverb:  A large
passive: comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal
active:  I was quickly between the sheets
noverb:  for
active:  I was weary
noverb:  after my night of adventure
active:  Sherlock Holmes was a man
noverb:  however
active:  he had an unsolved problem upon his mind
active:  would go for days
active:  even for a week, without rest, turning it over
active:  rearranging his facts
active:  looking at it from every point of view
active:  he had
active:  fathomed it
active:  convinced himself
active:  his data were insufficient
active:  It was soon evident
noverb:  to me
active:  he was
active:  now preparing for an all-night sitting
active:  He took off his coat
noverb:  waistcoat
noverb:  put on a large blue dressing-gown
novoice: wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed
noverb:  cushions from the sofa and armchairs
noverb:  With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan
noverb:  upon
active:  he perched himself cross-legged
novoice: with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him
noverb:  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there
noverb:  an old briar pipe between his lips
noverb:  his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling
active:  the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless
noverb:  with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features
active:  he sat as
active:  I dropped off
active:  to sleep
active:  he sat
active:  a sudden ejaculation caused me
active:  to wake up
active:  I found the summer sun shining into the apartment
active:  The pipe was still between his lips
noverb:  the smoke still curled upward
active:  the room was full of a dense tobacco haze
novoice: nothing remained of the heap of shag
active:  I had seen upon the previous night
noverb:  Awake
noverb:  Watson
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Game for a morning drive
noverb:  Certainly
noverb:  dress
active:  No one is stirring yet
active:  I know
noverb:  the stable-boy sleeps
active:  we shall soon have the trap out
active:  He chuckled to himself as he
active:  spoke
novoice: his eyes twinkled
active:  he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
active:  I dressed
active:  I glanced at my watch
active:  It was no wonder
noverb:  that no one was stirring
active:  It was twenty-five minutes past four
active:  I had hardly finished
active:  Holmes returned with the news
active:  the boy was putting in the horse
active:  I want to test a little theory of mine
active:  said he
noverb:  pulling on his boots
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe
active:  I deserve
passive: to be kicked from here to Charing Cross
active:  But I think
active:  I have the key of the affair now
active:  And where is it
active:  I asked
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  In the bathroom
active:  he answered
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I am not joking
active:  he continued
active:  seeing my look of incredulity
active:  I have just been there
active:  I have taken it out
active:  I have got it in this Gladstone bag
active:  Come on
noverb:  my boy
active:  we shall see
active:  it will not fit the lock
active:  We made our way downstairs
noverb:  possible
noverb:  out into the bright morning sunshine
active:  In the road stood our horse
noverb:  trap
noverb:  with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head
noverb:  We
active:  sprang in
noverb:  away we dashed down the London Road
active:  A few country carts were stirring
noverb:  bearing in vegetables to the metropolis
noverb:  the lines of villas on
active:  side were as silent
noverb:  lifeless as some city in a dream
active:  It has been in some points a singular case
active:  said Holmes
active:  flicking the horse on into a gallop
active:  I confess
active:  I have been
noverb:  a mole
active:  it is better
active:  to learn wisdom late
noverb:  never
active:  to learn it at all
active:  In town the earliest risers were just beginning
active:  to look sleepily from their windows
active:  we drove through the streets of the Surrey side
noverb:  Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road
active:  we crossed over the river
active:  dashing up Wellington Street
novoice: wheeled sharply to the right
active:  found ourselves in Bow Street
passive: Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force
active:  the two constables at the door saluted him
active:  One of them held the horse's head
active:  the other led us in
active:  is on duty
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Inspector Bradstreet
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Bradstreet
active:  are you
noverb:  A tall
active:  stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage
noverb:  in a peaked cap and frogged jacket
active:  I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Step into my room here
active:  It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table
active:  a telephone projecting from the wall
active:  The inspector sat down at his desk
active:  can
active:  I do for you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I called about that beggarman
noverb:  Boone
noverb:  the one
passive: was charged
passive: being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  of Lee
noverb:  Yes
passive: He was brought up
novoice: remanded for further inquiries
active:  I heard
noverb:  You have him here
noverb:  In the cells
noverb:  Is he quiet
noverb:  Oh
active:  he gives no trouble
active:  he is a dirty scoundrel
noverb:  Dirty
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is all
noverb:  we can do to make him wash his hands
active:  his face is
noverb:  a tinker's
noverb:  Well,
passive: once his case has been settled
active:  he will have a regular prison
active:  bath
active:  and I think
active:  you saw him
active:  you would agree with me
active:  he needed it
active:  I should like to see him very much
active:  Would you
passive: That is easily done
active:  Come this way
active:  You can leave your bag
noverb:  No
active:  I think
active:  I'll take it
noverb:  Very good
active:  Come this way
noverb:  you
active:  He led us down a passage
active:  opened a barred door
novoice: passed down a winding stair
active:  brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
active:  The third on the right is his
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  Here it is
noverb:  He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
novoice: glanced through
active:  He is asleep
active:  said he
active:  You can see him very well
noverb:  We
novoice: put our eyes to the grating
noverb:  The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly
noverb:  heavily
active:  He was a middle-sized man
active:  coarsely clad
active:  became his calling
active:  with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat
active:  He was
active:  the inspector had said
noverb:  extremely dirty
noverb:  the grime
active:  covered his face
active:  could not conceal its repulsive ugliness
active:  A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin
active:  by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip
passive: three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl
active:  A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
active:  He's a beauty
noverb:  isn't he
noverb:  said the inspector
active:  He certainly needs a wash
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  I had an idea
active:  he might
active:  I took the liberty
active:  bringing the tools with me
active:  He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke
active:  took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge
noverb:  He! he
active:  You are a funny one
active:  chuckled the inspector
noverb:  Now,
active:  you will have the great goodness
active:  to open
noverb:  door very quietly
noverb:  we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  I don't know
noverb:  not
active:  said the inspector
noverb:  He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells
active:  does he
active:  He slipped his key into the lock
noverb:  we all very quietly entered the cell
active:  The sleeper half turned
novoice: settled down once
noverb:  into a deep slumber
active:  Holmes stooped to the water-jug
active:  moistened his sponge
active:  rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face
noverb:  Let me introduce you
active:  he shouted
noverb:  to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent
noverb:  Never in my life have I seen such a sight
novoice: The man's face peeled off under the sponge
noverb:  the bark from a tree
noverb:  Gone was the coarse brown tint
noverb:  Gone
noverb:  too
active:  was the horrid scar
active:  had seamed it across
noverb:  the twisted lip
active:  had given the repulsive sneer to the face
active:  A twitch brought away the tangled red hair
noverb:  there
novoice: sitting up in his bed
active:  was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man
noverb:  black-haired
noverb:  smooth-skinned
active:  rubbing his eyes
active:  staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
active:  suddenly realising the exposure
active:  he broke into a scream
active:  threw himself down with his face to the pillow
noverb:  Great heavens
active:  cried the inspector
active:  it is
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  the missing man
active:  I know him from the photograph
active:  The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man
active:  abandons himself to his destiny
active:  Be it
active:  said he
active:  And pray
active:  am I charged with
active:  making away with Mr. Neville St.
noverb:  Oh
active:  come
noverb:  you can't be charged with
active:  they make a case of attempted suicide of it
active:  said the inspector with a grin
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have been twenty-seven years in the force
noverb:  this really takes the cake
active:  I am Mr. Neville St. Clair
noverb:  ,
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that no crime has been committed
noverb:  therefore
passive: I am illegally detained
noverb:  No crime
passive: a very great error has been committed
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  You would have done better to have trusted you wife
active:  It was not the wife
active:  it was the children
active:  groaned the prisoner
active:  God help me
active:  I would not have them ashamed of their father
noverb:  My God
noverb:  an exposure
active:  can
active:  I do
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch
active:  patted him kindly on the shoulder
active:  you leave it to a court of law
active:  to clear the matter up
active:  said he
active:  course
active:  you can hardly avoid publicity
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  you convince the police authorities
active:  there is no possible case against you
active:  I do not know
active:  there is any reason
noverb:  that the details should find their way into the papers
active:  Inspector Bradstreet would
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , make notes upon anything
active:  you might tell us
active:  submit it to the proper authorities
active:  The case would
active:  never go into court at all
active:  God bless you
active:  cried the prisoner passionately
active:  I would have endured imprisonment
noverb:  ay
noverb:  even execution
noverb:  rather
active:  have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
active:  You are the first
active:  have ever heard my story
active:  My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield
active:  I received an excellent education
active:  I travelled in my youth
active:  took to the stage
active:  finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London
noverb:  One day my editor wished
active:  to have a series of articles
active:  begging in the metropolis
active:  I volunteered to supply them
active:  There was the point
noverb:  from
active:  all my adventures started
active:  It was only
active:  trying begging as an amateur
active:  I could get the facts upon
active:  to base my articles
noverb:  When an actor
active:  I had
noverb:  of course
active:  learned all the secrets
active:  making up
active:  had been famous in the green-room for my skill
active:  I took advantage now of my attainments
active:  I painted my face
active:  to make myself
noverb:  possible I made a good scar
active:  fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster
active:  with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city
noverb:  ostensibly as a match-seller
noverb:  really as a beggar
active:  For seven hours I plied my trade
active:  I returned home in the evening
passive: I found to my surprise
active:  I had received no less than 26s
noverb:  4d
active:  I wrote my articles
active:  thought little
noverb:  of the matter until
noverb:  some time later
active:  I backed a bill for a friend
active:  had a writ served upon me for $25
active:  I was at my wit's end
active:  to get the money
active:  a sudden idea came to me
active:  I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor
novoice: asked for a holiday from my employers
novoice: spent the time
active:  begging in the City under my disguise
active:  In ten days I had the money
active:  had paid the debt
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can imagine
noverb:  hard it was
active:  to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week
active:  I knew
active:  I could earn as much in a day
active:  smearing my face with a little paint
active:  laying my cap on the ground
noverb:  sitting still
active:  It was a long fight between my pride and the money
novoice: the dollars won at last
active:  I threw up reporting
noverb:  sat day after day in the corner
active:  I had first chosen
noverb:  inspiring pity by my ghastly face
active:  filling my pockets with coppers
active:  Only one man knew my secret
active:  He was the keeper
noverb:  of a low den in
active:  I used
active:  to lodge in Swandam Lane
active:  I could
active:  every morning emerge as a squalid beggar
active:  in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town
noverb:  This fellow, a Lascar
passive: was well paid by me for his rooms
active:  I knew
active:  my secret was safe in his possession
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  very soon I found
active:  I was saving considerable sums of money
active:  I do not mean
active:  any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--
active:  I had exceptional advantages in my power
active:  making up
noverb:  also in a facility of repartee
active:  improved by practice
active:  made me quite a recognised character in the City
noverb:  All day a stream of pennies
passive: varied by silver
novoice: poured in upon me
active:  it was a very bad day in
active:  I failed to take $2
active:  I grew richer
active:  I grew more ambitious
active:  took a house in the country
noverb:  eventually married
active:  without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation
active:  My dear wife knew
active:  I had business in the City
active:  She little knew
active:  Last Monday I had finished for the day
active:  was dressing in my room above the opium den
active:  I looked out of my window
noverb:  saw
noverb:  to my horror and astonishment
active:  my wife was standing in the street
noverb:  with her eyes fixed full upon me
active:  I gave a cry of surprise
active:  threw up my arms
active:  to cover my face
active:  rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him
active:  to prevent anyone
active:  coming up to me
active:  I heard her voice downstairs
active:  I knew
active:  she could not ascend
active:  Swiftly I threw off my clothes
passive: pulled on those of a beggar
noverb:  put on my pigments and wig
active:  Even a wife's eyes could not pierce
active:  complete a disguise
active:  it occurred to me
active:  there might be a search
noverb:  in the room
active:  the clothes might betray me
noverb:  I threw open the window
active:  reopening by my violence a small cut
active:  I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning
active:  Then I seized my coat
passive: was weighted by the coppers
active:  I had just transferred to
noverb:  it from the leather bag in
active:  I carried my takings
active:  I hurled it out of the window
active:  it disappeared into the Thames
active:  The other clothes would have followed
noverb:  at that moment
active:  there was a rush of constables up the stair
noverb:  a few minutes after I found
noverb:  rather
active:  I confess
noverb:  to my relief
noverb:  instead
passive: being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair
passive: I was arrested as his murderer
active:  I do not know
active:  there is anything
noverb:  else for me
active:  to explain
passive: I was determined
active:  to preserve my disguise
noverb:  possible
noverb:  hence my preference for a dirty face
active:  Knowing
active:  my wife would be terribly anxious
active:  I slipped off my ring
active:  confided it to the Lascar at a moment
active:  no constable was watching me
noverb:  together with a hurried scrawl
active:  telling her
active:  she had no cause
active:  to fear
noverb:  That note only reached her yesterday
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Good God
noverb:  a week
active:  she must have spent
active:  The police have watched this Lascar
active:  said Inspector Bradstreet
active:  and I can quite understand
active:  he might find it difficult
active:  to post a letter unobserved
active:  Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his
active:  forgot all about it for some days
active:  That was it
active:  said Holmes
active:  nodding approvingly
active:  I have no doubt of it
passive: have
passive: you never been prosecuted for begging
noverb:  Many times
active:  was a fine to me
active:  It must stop here
noverb:  however
active:  said Bradstreet
active:  the police are to hush this thing up
active:  there must be no
noverb:  more of Hugh Boone
active:  I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths
active:  a man can take
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I think
active:  it is probable
noverb:  that no further steps may be taken
passive: you are found again
noverb:  all must come out
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  we are very much indebted to you
active:  having cleared the matter up
active:  I wish
active:  I knew
active:  you reach your results
active:  I reached this one
active:  said my friend
active:  sitting upon five pillows
active:  consuming an ounce of shag
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we drive to Baker Street
active:  we shall just be in time for breakfast
noverb:  VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
active:  I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas
noverb:  with the intention
noverb:  wishing him the compliments of the season
active:  He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown
noverb:  a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right
noverb:  a pile of crumpled morning papers
noverb:  evidently newly studied
noverb:  near at hand
active:  Beside the couch was a wooden chair
active:  on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
noverb:  disreputable hard-felt hat
noverb:  much the worse for wear
novoice: cracked in several places
noverb:  A lens
noverb:  a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested
passive: the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
passive: You are engaged
active:  said I
active:  perhaps I interrupt you
noverb:  Not at all
active:  I am glad
active:  to have a friend with
active:  I can discuss my results
active:  The matter is a perfectly trivial one
noverb:  --he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--
novoice: there are points in connection with it
active:  are not entirely devoid of interest
noverb:  even of instruction
active:  I seated myself in his armchair
active:  warmed my hands
noverb:  his crackling fire
active:  for a sharp frost had set in
active:  the windows were thick with the ice crystals
active:  I suppose
active:  I remarked
noverb:  homely as it looks
noverb:  this thing has some deadly story linked on to it
active:  it is the clue
noverb:  which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  No crime
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  Only one of those whimsical little incidents
active:  will happen
noverb:  you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
noverb:  Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity
passive: every possible combination of events may be expected
active:  to take place
noverb:  many a little problem will be presented
active:  may be striking
noverb:  bizarre
active:  being criminal
active:  We have already had experience of such
noverb:  much
active:  I remarked
noverb:  of the last six cases
active:  I have added to my notes
active:  three have been entirely free of any legal crime
noverb:  Precisely
active:  You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland,
noverb:  to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
active:  You know Peterson, the commissionaire
noverb:  Yes
active:  It is to him
active:  this trophy belongs
active:  It is his hat
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  he found it
active:  Its owner is unknown
active:  I beg
active:  you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
noverb:  as an intellectual problem
noverb:  And,
noverb:  first
noverb:  as to
active:  it came here
active:  It arrived upon Christmas morning
noverb:  in company with a good fat goose
active:  is
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire
active:  The facts are these
noverb:  about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson
active:  you know
active:  is a very honest fellow
active:  was returning from some small jollification
active:  was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road
active:  In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man
noverb:  walking with a slight stagger
active:  carrying a white goose
novoice: slung over his shoulder
active:  he reached the corner of Goodge Street
active:  a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs
active:  One of the latter knocked off the man's hat
noverb:  on
active:  he raised his stick
active:  to defend himself
active:  swinging it over his head
active:  smashed the shop window behind him
active:  Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants
noverb:  the man
noverb:  shocked
active:  having broken the window
active:  seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
active:  dropped his goose
active:  took to his heels
novoice: vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets
noverb:  lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road
active:  The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson
passive: he was left in possession of the field of battle
noverb:  also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose
active:  surely he restored to their owner
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  there lies the problem
active:  It is true
noverb:  that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card
passive: was tied to the bird's left leg
active:  it is also true
noverb:  that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat
active:  there are some thousands of Bakers
noverb:  ,
noverb:  some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours
active:  it is not easy
active:  to restore lost property to any one of them
active:  did Peterson
active:  do
active:  He brought round
noverb:  hat
noverb:  goose to me on Christmas morning
noverb:  knowing
active:  even the smallest problems are of interest to me
noverb:  The goose
active:  we retained until this morning
active:  there were signs
noverb:  in spite of the slight frost
active:  it would be well
passive: it should be eaten without unnecessary delay
active:  Its finder has carried it off
noverb:  therefore
active:  to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
active:  I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman
active:  lost his Christmas dinner
active:  Did he not advertise
noverb:  No
noverb:  clue could you have as to his identity
noverb:  Only
active:  we can deduce
noverb:  From his hat
noverb:  Precisely
active:  you are joking
active:  can you gather from this old battered felt
active:  Here is my lens
active:  You know my methods
active:  can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man
active:  has worn this article
active:  I took the tattered object in my hands
active:  turned it over rather ruefully
active:  It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape
noverb:  hard
noverb:  much the worse for wear
active:  The lining had been of red silk
passive: was a good deal discoloured
active:  There was no maker's name
active:  Holmes had remarked
noverb:  the initials
noverb:  H. B.
passive: were scrawled upon one side
passive: It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer
active:  the elastic was missing
noverb:  For the rest
passive: it was cracked
noverb:  exceedingly dusty
novoice: spotted in several places
novoice: there seemed
active:  to have been some attempt
active:  to hide the discoloured patches
active:  smearing them with ink
active:  I can see nothing
active:  said I
active:  handing it back to my friend
noverb:  On the contrary
noverb:  Watson
active:  you can see everything
active:  You fail
noverb:  however
active:  to reason from
active:  you see
active:  You are too timid
noverb:  in drawing your inferences
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  it is
active:  you can infer from this hat
active:  He picked it up
active:  gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
active:  was characteristic of him
active:  It is perhaps less suggestive
noverb:  than it might
passive: have been
active:  he remarked
noverb:  and
active:  there are a few inferences
noverb:  which are very distinct
noverb:  a few others
active:  represent at least a strong balance of probability
active:  the man was highly intellectual
active:  is of course obvious upon the face of it
noverb:  also
active:  he was fairly well-to
noverb:  -do within the last three years
active:  he has now fallen upon evil days
active:  He had foresight
novoice: has less now
noverb:  formerly
active:  pointing to a moral retrogression
passive: taken with the decline of his fortunes
active:  seems to indicate some evil influence
noverb:  probably drink
noverb:  at work upon him
active:  This may account also for the obvious fact
active:  his wife has ceased to love him
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  He has
noverb:  however
active:  retained some degree of self-respect
active:  he continued
active:  disregarding my remonstrance
active:  He is a man
noverb:  who leads a sedentary life
active:  goes out little
active:  is out of training entirely
active:  is middle-aged
active:  has grizzled hair
active:  he has
active:  had cut within the last few days
active:  he anoints with lime-cream
noverb:  These are the more patent facts
active:  are to be deduced from his hat
noverb:  Also,
noverb:  by the way
active:  it is extremely improbable
noverb:  that he has gas laid on in his house
active:  You are certainly joking
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  Not in the least
active:  Is it possible
noverb:  even now
noverb:  I give you these results
active:  you are unable
active:  to see
passive: they are attained
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am very stupid
active:  I must confess
active:  I am unable
active:  to follow you
noverb:  For example
active:  did you deduce
active:  this man was intellectual
active:  For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head
active:  It came right over the forehead
novoice: settled upon the bridge of his nose
active:  It is a question of cubic capacity
active:  said he
noverb:  a man with
noverb:  large a brain must have something in it
noverb:  The decline of his fortunes
active:  This hat is three years old
passive: These flat brims curled
active:  at the edge came in
active:  It is a hat of the very best quality
noverb:  Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining
active:  this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago
active:  has had no hat
active:  he has assuredly gone down in the world
noverb:  Well,
active:  is clear enough
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  about the foresight and the moral retrogression
active:  Sherlock Holmes laughed
active:  Here is the foresight
active:  said
active:  he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
passive: They are never sold upon hats
active:  this man ordered one
active:  it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight
active:  he went out of his way
active:  to take this precaution against the wind
active:  we see
active:  he has broken the elastic
active:  has not troubled to replace it
active:  it is obvious
noverb:  that he has less foresight now
noverb:  formerly
active:  is a distinct proof of a weakening nature
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt
active:  daubing them with ink
active:  is a sign
active:  he has not entirely lost his self-respect
active:  Your reasoning is certainly plausible
noverb:  The further points
active:  he is middle-aged
noverb:  ,
passive: his hair is grizzled
passive: it has been recently cut
noverb:  he uses lime-cream
noverb:  , are all
passive: to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining
active:  The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends
noverb:  clean cut by the scissors of the barber
noverb:  They all appear to be adhesive
active:  there is a distinct odour of lime-cream
noverb:  This dust
active:  you will observe
active:  is not the gritty, grey dust of the street
noverb:  the fluffy brown dust of the house
active:  showing
passive: it has been hung up indoors
noverb:  of the time
noverb:  the marks of moisture upon the
active:  are proof positive
active:  the wearer perspired very freely
active:  could therefore
active:  hardly be in the best of training
noverb:  his wife
active:  you said
active:  she had ceased to love him
passive: This hat has not been brushed for weeks
active:  When I see you
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat
active:  your wife allows you
active:  to go out in such a state
active:  I shall fear
active:  you also have been unfortunate enough
active:  to lose your wife's affection
active:  he might be a bachelor
noverb:  Nay,
active:  he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife
active:  Remember the card upon the bird's leg
active:  You have an answer to everything
noverb:  on earth do you deduce
passive: the gas is not laid on in his house
active:  One tallow stain
noverb:  even two
active:  might come by chance
active:  I see no less than five
active:  I think
active:  there can be little doubt
passive: the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow
noverb:  walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other
noverb:  Anyhow,
active:  he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet
active:  Are you satisfied
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is very ingenious
active:  said I
noverb:  laughing
noverb:  as you said just now
active:  there has been no crime committed
active:  no harm done save the loss of a goose
noverb:  all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
active:  Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth
active:  to reply
active:  the door flew open
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  the commissionaire
active:  rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man
passive: is dazed with astonishment
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  The goose
noverb:  sir
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Eh
noverb:  of it
active:  Has it returned to life
novoice: flapped off through the kitchen window
noverb:  Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa
active:  to get a fairer view of the man's excited face
noverb:  See here
noverb:  sir
noverb:  See
passive: my wife found in its crop
active:  He held out his hand
active:  displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone
noverb:  rather smaller
noverb:  a bean in size
noverb:  of such purity and radiance
active:  it twinkled
noverb:  an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
active:  Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle
noverb:  By Jove
noverb:  Peterson
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  this is treasure trove indeed
active:  I suppose
active:  you know
active:  you have got
noverb:  A diamond
noverb:  sir
noverb:  A precious stone
active:  It cuts into glass as
active:  it were putty
active:  It's more than a precious stone
active:  It is the precious stone
noverb:  Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  Precisely
active:  I ought to know its size
noverb:  shape
noverb:  seeing
active:  I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately
active:  It is absolutely unique
noverb:  ,
passive: its value can only be conjectured
passive: the reward offered
active:  of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
noverb:  A thousand pounds
noverb:  Great Lord of mercy
novoice: The commissionaire plumped down into a chair
novoice: stared from one to the other of us
active:  That is the reward
active:  I have reason
active:  to know
active:  there are sentimental considerations in the background
active:  would induce the Countess
active:  to part with half her fortune
active:  she could
active:  recover the gem
passive: It was lost
active:  I remember aright
noverb:  at the Hotel Cosmopolitan
active:  I remarked
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  on December 22nd
noverb:  just five days ago
passive: John Horner, a plumber, was accused
active:  having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case
noverb:  The evidence
active:  against him was so strong
noverb:  that the case has been referred to the Assizes
active:  I have some account of the matter here
active:  I believe
active:  He rummaged amid his newspapers
active:  glancing over the dates
noverb:  until at last he smoothed one out
active:  doubled it over
active:  read
noverb:  the following paragraph
noverb:  Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery
noverb:  John Horner
noverb:  26
noverb:  plumber
active:  was brought up upon the charge
novoice: having upon the 22nd inst
noverb:  abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle
noverb:  James Ryder
noverb:  upper-attendant at the hotel
active:  gave his evidence to the effect
active:  he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order
active:  he might solder the second bar of the grate
active:  was loose
active:  He had remained with Horner some little time
passive: had finally been called away
noverb:  On returning
active:  he found
active:  Horner had disappeared
active:  the bureau had been forced open
noverb:  the small morocco casket in
novoice: as it afterwards transpired
passive: the Countess was accustomed
active:  to keep her jewel
active:  was lying empty upon the dressing-table
noverb:  Ryder
active:  gave the alarm
passive: Horner was arrested the same evening
passive: the stone could not be found
noverb:  upon his person
noverb:  in his rooms
noverb:  Catherine Cusack
noverb:  maid to the Countess
active:  deposed
active:  to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay
active:  discovering the robbery
active:  to having rushed into the room
active:  she found matters
novoice: described by the last witness
active:  Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner
active:  struggled frantically
active:  protested his innocence in the strongest terms
passive: Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner
novoice: the magistrate refused
active:  to deal summarily with the offence
active:  referred it to the Assizes
noverb:  Horner
active:  had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings
novoice: fainted away at the conclusion
passive: was carried out of court
noverb:  Hum
noverb:  much for the police-court
active:  said Holmes thoughtfully
noverb:  tossing aside the paper
noverb:  The question for us now
active:  to solve
noverb:  is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other
active:  You see
noverb:  Watson
active:  our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important
noverb:  less innocent aspect
active:  Here is the stone
active:  the stone came from the goose
active:  the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with
active:  I have bored you
active:  now we must set ourselves very seriously
active:  to finding this gentleman
active:  ascertaining
noverb:  part he has played in this little mystery
active:  To do this
active:  we must try the simplest means first
noverb:  these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers
noverb:  this fail
active:  I shall have recourse to other methods
active:  will you say
noverb:  Give me a pencil
noverb:  slip of paper
noverb:  Now,
passive: Found at the corner of Goodge Street
noverb:  a goose
noverb:  a black felt hat
active:  Mr. Henry Baker can have the same
active:  applying at 6
noverb:  30 this evening at 221B
noverb:  Baker Street
active:  That is clear and concise
noverb:  Very
active:  will he see it
noverb:  Well,
active:  he is sure
active:  to keep an eye on the papers
active:  , to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one
active:  He was clearly
passive: scared by his mischance
active:  breaking the window
noverb:  by the approach of Peterson
noverb:  he thought of nothing
noverb:  flight
active:  he must have bitterly regretted the impulse
active:  caused him
active:  to drop his bird
noverb:  again
active:  the introduction of his name will cause him
active:  to see it
noverb:  for everyone
noverb:  knows him will direct his attention to it
noverb:  Here you are
noverb:  Peterson
active:  run down to the advertising agency
active:  have this put in the evening papers
noverb:  In
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others
active:  occur to
noverb:  you
noverb:  Very well
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And this stone
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I shall keep the stone
active:  Thank you
noverb:  And,
active:  I say
noverb:  Peterson
noverb:  just buy a goose on your way back
noverb:  leave it here with me
noverb:  for we must have one
active:  to give to this gentleman in place of the one
active:  your family is now devouring
active:  When the commissionaire had gone
active:  Holmes took up the stone
active:  held it against the light
active:  It's a bonny thing
active:  said he
noverb:  Just see
active:  it glints and sparkles
noverb:  Of course
active:  it is a nucleus and focus of crime
active:  Every good stone is
active:  They are the devil's pet baits
active:  In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
active:  This stone is not
noverb:  twenty years old
passive: It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China
active:  is remarkable
active:  having every characteristic of the carbuncle
active:  save
active:  it is blue
noverb:  in shade instead of ruby red
noverb:  In spite of its youth
active:  it has already a sinister history
active:  There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies
novoice: brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight
active:  crystallised charcoal
active:  would think
noverb:  pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison
active:  I'll lock it up in my strong box now
noverb:  drop a line to the Countess
active:  to say
active:  we have it
active:  Do you think
active:  this man Horner is innocent
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Well,
active:  do you imagine
active:  this other one, Henry Baker, had anything
active:  to do with the matter
active:  It is
active:  I think
noverb:  much more likely
active:  Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man
active:  had no idea
noverb:  the bird
active:  he was carrying
active:  was of considerably more value
passive: it were made of solid gold
noverb:  however
active:  I shall determine by a very simple test
active:  we have an answer to our advertisement
active:  And you can do nothing until
noverb:  Nothing
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  I shall continue my professional round
active:  But I shall come back in the evening at the hour
active:  you have mentioned
noverb:  for I should like to see the solution of
active:  tangled a business
noverb:  Very glad
active:  to see you
active:  I dine at seven
active:  There is a woodcock
active:  I believe
active:  By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson
active:  to examine its crop
passive: I had been delayed at a case
active:  it was a little after half-past six
active:  I found myself in Baker Street once
active:  As I approached the house
active:  I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat
passive: was buttoned up to his chin waiting
noverb:  in the bright semicircle
passive: was thrown from the fanlight
noverb:  Just
active:  I arrived the door
passive: was opened
passive: we were shown up together to Holmes' room
noverb:  Mr. Henry Baker
active:  I believe
active:  said he
noverb:  rising from his armchair
active:  greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality
active:  he could
active:  readily assume
noverb:  Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker
active:  It is a cold night
active:  I observe
active:  your circulation is more adapted for summer
noverb:  for winter
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have just come at the right time
active:  Is
noverb:  your hat, Mr. Baker
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that is undoubtedly my hat
active:  He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head,
noverb:  a broad, intelligent face
noverb:  sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown
noverb:  A touch of red in nose
active:  cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits
noverb:  His rusty black frock-coat
passive: was buttoned right up in front
novoice: with the collar turned up
active:  his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt
active:  He spoke in a slow staccato fashion
active:  choosing his words with care
active:  gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters
active:  had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune
active:  We have retained these things for some days
active:  said Holmes
active:  we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address
active:  I am at a loss
active:  to know now
active:  you did not advertise
active:  Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh
active:  Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were
active:  he remarked
active:  I had no doubt
noverb:  the gang of roughs
noverb:  assaulted me had carried off
noverb:  my hat and the bird
active:  I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt
active:  recovering them
noverb:  Very naturally
passive: By the way, about the bird, we were compelled
active:  to eat it
active:  To eat it
noverb:  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
noverb:  Yes
active:  it would have been
active:  of no use to anyone had we not done
active:  But I presume
noverb:  this other goose upon the sideboard
active:  is about the same weight
noverb:  perfectly fresh
active:  will answer your purpose equally well
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  certainly
active:  answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief
noverb:  Of course
active:  we still have the feathers, legs, crop
noverb:  on of your own bird
noverb:  you wish
noverb:  The man burst into a hearty laugh
active:  They might be useful
noverb:  to me as relics of my adventure
active:  said he
noverb:  beyond
active:  I can hardly see
noverb:  use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going
active:  to be to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I think
active:  , with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird
active:  I perceive upon the sideboard
novoice: Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
active:  There is your hat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  there your bird
active:  said he
noverb:  By the way
active:  would it bore you
active:  to tell me
active:  you got the other one from
active:  I am somewhat of a fowl fancier
active:  I have seldom seen a better grown goose
noverb:  Certainly,
noverb:  sir
active:  said Baker
active:  had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm
active:  There are a few of us
active:  frequent the Alpha Inn
noverb:  near the Museum
active:  we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day
active:  you understand
noverb:  This year our good host
noverb:  Windigate by name
active:  instituted a goose club
noverb:  by
noverb:  on consideration of some few pence every week
active:  we were each
active:  to receive a bird at Christmas
passive: My pence were duly paid
active:  the rest is familiar to you
active:  I am much indebted
noverb:  to you
noverb:  sir
passive: for a Scotch bonnet is fitted
noverb:  to my years nor my gravity
active:  With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to
noverb:  of us
novoice: strode off upon his way
noverb:  much for Mr. Henry Baker
active:  said Holmes
active:  he had closed the door behind him
active:  It is quite certain
noverb:  that he knows nothing
noverb:  about the matter
active:  Are you hungry
noverb:  Watson
noverb:  Not particularly
active:  I suggest
active:  we turn our dinner into a supper
active:  follow up this clue
active:  it is still hot
noverb:  By all means
active:  It was a bitter night
active:  we drew on our ulsters
active:  wrapped cravats about our throats
active:  the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky
active:  the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
noverb:  so many pistol shots
active:  Our footfalls rang out crisply
noverb:  loudly
active:  we swung through the doctors' quarter
noverb:  Wimpole Street
noverb:  Harley Street
noverb:  through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street
active:  In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn
active:  is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets
noverb:  which runs down into Holborn
noverb:  Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar
active:  ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord
active:  Your beer should be excellent
active:  it is
noverb:  your geese
active:  said he
noverb:  My geese
active:  The man seemed surprised
noverb:  Yes
active:  I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker
noverb:  who was a member of your goose club
noverb:  Ah! yes
active:  I see
noverb:  you see
noverb:  sir
active:  them's not our geese
noverb:  Indeed
noverb:  Well,
active:  I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden
noverb:  Indeed
active:  I know some of them
active:  was it
active:  Breckinridge is his name
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  I don't know him
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  here's your good health landlord
noverb:  prosperity to your house
noverb:  Good-night
noverb:  Now for Mr. Breckinridge
active:  he continued
active:  buttoning up his coat
active:  we came out into the frosty air
active:  Remember
noverb:  Watson
active:  we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain
active:  we have at the other a man
active:  will certainly get seven years' penal servitude
active:  we can establish his innocence
active:  It is possible
noverb:  that our inquiry may
active:  confirm his guilt
active:  , in any case, we have a line of investigation
passive: has been missed by the police
active:  a singular chance has placed in our hands
noverb:  Let us follow it out to the bitter end
noverb:  Faces to the south
noverb:  quick march
active:  We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street,
noverb:  through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market
active:  One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it
noverb:  the proprietor a horsey-looking man
noverb:  with a sharp face
noverb:  trim side-whiskers was helping a boy
active:  to put up the shutters
noverb:  Good-evening
active:  It's a cold night
active:  said Holmes
novoice: The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
passive: Sold out of geese
active:  I see
active:  continued Holmes
noverb:  pointing at the bare slabs of marble
novoice: Let
active:  you have five hundred to-morrow morning
active:  That's no good
noverb:  Well,
active:  there are some
noverb:  on the stall with the gas-flare
noverb:  Ah
passive: I was recommended to
noverb:  you
noverb:  by
noverb:  The landlord of the Alpha
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  I sent him a couple of dozen
noverb:  Fine birds they were
noverb:  too
active:  Now where did you get them from
active:  To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  mister
active:  said he
novoice: with his head cocked
noverb:  his arms akimbo
active:  are you driving at
noverb:  Let's have it straight
noverb:  now
active:  It is straight enough
active:  I should like to know
noverb:  sold you the geese
active:  you supplied to the Alpha
noverb:  Well
noverb:  I shan't tell you
noverb:  now
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is a matter of no importance
noverb:  I don't know
active:  you should be so warm
noverb:  over such a trifle
noverb:  Warm
active:  You'd be
active:  warm
noverb:  maybe
active:  you were
active:  I am
active:  When I pay good money for a good article
active:  there should be an end of the business
active:  it's
active:  are the geese
noverb:  and 'Who did you sell the geese to
noverb:  and 'What will you take for the geese
active:  One would think
active:  they were the only geese
noverb:  in the world
active:  to hear the fuss
passive: is made over them
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have no connection with any other people
active:  have been making inquiries
active:  said Holmes carelessly
noverb:  you won't tell us
active:  the bet is off
active:  that is all
noverb:  I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls
active:  I have a fiver on it
noverb:  the bird
active:  I ate
active:  is country
novoice: bred
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  you've lost your fiver
noverb:  for it's town
novoice: bred
active:  snapped the salesman
active:  It's nothing of the kind
active:  I say
active:  it is
noverb:  I don't believe it
noverb:  D'you think
active:  you know more about fowls
noverb:  I
active:  have handled them
active:  I was a nipper
active:  I tell you
noverb:  all those birds
active:  went to
noverb:  the Alpha were town bred
active:  You'll never persuade me
active:  to believe that
active:  Will you bet
active:  It's merely taking your money
noverb:  for I know
active:  I am right
active:  But I'll have a sovereign on with you
noverb:  just
active:  to teach you not
active:  to be obstinate
active:  The salesman chuckled grimly
noverb:  Bring me the books
noverb:  Bill
active:  said he
active:  The small boy brought round a small thin volume
noverb:  a great greasy-backed one
active:  laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
noverb:  Now
noverb:  Mr. Cocksure
active:  said the salesman
active:  I thought
active:  I was out of geese
active:  I finish
active:  you'll find
active:  there is still one left in my shop
active:  You see this little book
noverb:  Well
active:  That's the list of the folk from
active:  I buy
noverb:  D'you see
noverb:  Well,
active:  here on this page are the country folk
active:  the numbers after their names are
active:  their accounts
active:  are in the big ledger
noverb:  Now,
active:  You see this other page in red ink
noverb:  Well,
active:  is a list of my town suppliers
noverb:  Now,
active:  look at
noverb:  third name
active:  Just read
noverb:  it out to me
noverb:  Mrs. Oakshott

active:  you are
noverb:  And underneath
passive: Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha
noverb:  at 12s
active:  have you
active:  to say now
active:  Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined
active:  He drew a sovereign from his pocket
active:  threw it down upon the slab
noverb:  turning away with the air of a man
active:  disgust is too deep for words
noverb:  A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post
active:  laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion
active:  was peculiar to him
active:  When you see a man with whiskers of
noverb:  cut
noverb:  the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket
active:  you can always draw him by a bet
active:  said he
active:  I daresay
active:  I had put $100 down in front of him
noverb:  that man would not have given me such complete information
passive: was drawn from him by the idea
active:  he was doing me on a wager
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Watson
active:  we are
active:  I fancy
active:  nearing the end of our quest
noverb:  the only point
active:  remains
passive: to be determined
active:  is
active:  we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night
active:  we should reserve it for to-morrow
active:  It is clear
noverb:  from
active:  surly fellow said
active:  there are others
noverb:  besides ourselves
active:  are anxious
noverb:  about the matter
active:  I should
passive: His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub
active:  broke out from the stall
active:  we had just left
noverb:  Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
passive: was thrown by the swinging lamp
noverb:  Breckinridge
noverb:  the salesman
active:  framed in the door of his stall
active:  was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
noverb:  I've had enough of you and your geese
active:  he shouted
active:  I wish
novoice: you were all
noverb:  at the devil together
active:  you come
active:  pestering me any
noverb:  with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you
active:  You bring Mrs. Oakshott here
active:  I'll answer her
active:  have you
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  Did I buy the geese off you
noverb:  No
active:  one of them was mine all the same
active:  whined the little man
noverb:  Well,
active:  ask Mrs. Oakshott for it
active:  She told me
active:  to ask you
noverb:  Well,
active:  you can ask the King of Proosia
noverb:  for all I care
noverb:  I've had enough of it
active:  Get out of this
active:  He rushed fiercely forward
active:  the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
noverb:  Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road
active:  whispered Holmes
active:  Come with me
active:  we will see
active:  is to be made of this fellow
active:  Striding through the scattered knots of people
active:  lounged round the flaring stalls
active:  my companion speedily overtook the little man
active:  touched him upon the shoulder
active:  He sprang round
active:  I could see in the gas-light
passive: every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
active:  are you
noverb:  do you want
active:  he asked in a quavering voice
active:  You will excuse me
active:  said Holmes blandly
active:  I could not help
active:  overhearing the questions
noverb:  you put to the salesman just now
active:  I think
active:  I could be of assistance to you
noverb:  You
active:  are you
active:  could you know anything of the matter
active:  My name is Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is my business
active:  to know
noverb:  other people don't know
active:  you can know nothing of this
active:  Excuse me
active:  I know everything of it
active:  You are endeavouring to trace some geese
passive: were sold
active:  by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge
noverb:  by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club
noverb:  of
active:  Mr. Henry Baker is a member
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  sir
active:  you are the
noverb:  very man
active:  I have longed
active:  to meet
active:  cried the little fellow with outstretched hands
noverb:  quivering fingers
active:  I can hardly explain to
noverb:  you
noverb:  interested I am in this matter
active:  Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler
active:  was passing
noverb:  In
active:  case
active:  we had
active:  better discuss it in a cosy room rather
noverb:  in this wind-swept market-place
active:  said he
active:  pray
active:  tell me
active:  we go farther
active:  it is
active:  I have the pleasure
active:  assisting
active:  The man hesitated for an instant
active:  My name is John Robinson
active:  he answered with a sidelong glance
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  the real name
active:  said Holmes sweetly
active:  It is always awkward doing business with an alias
active:  A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
noverb:  Well
active:  said he
active:  my real name is James Ryder
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan
active:  Pray step into the cab
active:  I shall soon be able
noverb:  to tell you everything
active:  you would wish
active:  to know
noverb:  The little man
novoice: stood
active:  glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes
noverb:  as one
active:  is not sure
active:  he is on the verge of a windfall
noverb:  of a catastrophe
active:  he stepped into the cab
noverb:  in half an hour
active:  we were back
noverb:  in the sitting-room at Baker Street
passive: Nothing had been said during our drive
noverb:  the high
noverb:  thin breathing of our new companion
noverb:  the claspings and unclaspings of his hands
noverb:  spoke of the nervous tension within him
noverb:  Here we are
active:  said Holmes cheerily
active:  we filed into the room
active:  The fire looks very seasonable in this weather
active:  You look cold
noverb:  Mr. Ryder
noverb:  Pray take the basket-chair
active:  I will just put on my slippers
active:  we settle this little matter of yours
noverb:  Now,
active:  You want to know
active:  became of those geese
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  Or rather
active:  I fancy
noverb:  of that goose
active:  It was one bird
active:  I imagine in
passive: you were interested
noverb:  white
noverb:  with a black bar across the tail
active:  Ryder quivered with emotion
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  sir
active:  he cried
active:  can you tell me
active:  it went to
active:  It came here
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  a most remarkable bird
active:  it proved
noverb:  I don't wonder
active:  you should take an interest in it
active:  It laid an egg after
active:  it was dead
noverb:  --the bonniest
noverb:  brightest little blue egg
passive: ever was seen
active:  I have it here in my museum
active:  Our visitor staggered to his feet
active:  clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand
active:  Holmes unlocked his strong-box
active:  held up the blue carbuncle
novoice: shone out
noverb:  a star
noverb:  with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance
active:  Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face
noverb:  uncertain
active:  to claim
active:  to disown it
noverb:  The game's up
noverb:  Ryder
active:  said Holmes quietly
active:  Hold up
noverb:  man
active:  you'll be into the fire
active:  Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson
active:  He's not got blood enough
active:  to go in for felony with impunity
noverb:  Give him a dash of brandy
active:  Now he looks a little more human
noverb:  a shrimp
active:  it is
active:  to be sure
active:  For a moment he had staggered
noverb:  nearly fallen
novoice: the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks
active:  he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
active:  I have almost every link in my hands
noverb:  all the proofs
active:  I could possibly need
active:  there is little
noverb:  which you need
active:  tell me
noverb:  Still,
passive: that little may as well be cleared up
active:  to make the case complete
active:  You had heard
noverb:  Ryder
noverb:  of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?
active:  It was Catherine Cusack
noverb:  who told me of it
active:  said he in a crackling voice
active:  I see
noverb:  her ladyship's waiting-maid
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  the temptation of sudden wealth
noverb:  easily acquired was too much for you
active:  it has been for better men
noverb:  you
active:  you were not very scrupulous
active:  in the means you used
active:  It seems to me
noverb:  Ryder
active:  there is the making
noverb:  of a very pretty villain in you
active:  You knew
passive: this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before
active:  that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
active:  did
active:  you do
active:  You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--
active:  you managed
active:  he should be the man
novoice: sent for
active:  he had left
active:  you rifled the jewel-case
active:  raised the alarm
active:  had this unfortunate man arrested
noverb:  You
active:  Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug
novoice: clutched at my companion's knees
noverb:  For God's sake
active:  have mercy
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  Think of my father
noverb:  Of my mother
active:  It would break their hearts
active:  I never went wrong before
active:  I never will again
active:  I swear it
active:  I'll swear it on a Bible
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  don't bring it into court
noverb:  For Christ's sake
noverb:  don't
active:  Get back into your chair
active:  said Holmes sternly
active:  It is very well
active:  to cringe and crawl now
active:  you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of
active:  he knew nothing
active:  I will fly
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I will leave the country, sir
active:  the charge against him will break down
noverb:  Hum
active:  We will talk about that
noverb:  And now let us hear a true account of the next act
active:  came the stone into the goose
active:  came the goose into the open market
noverb:  Tell us the truth
active:  for there lies your only hope of safety
active:  Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips
noverb:  I will tell you it just
novoice: it happened
noverb:  sir
active:  said he
passive: When Horner had been arrested
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  it would be best
noverb:  for me
active:  to get away with the stone at once
noverb:  for I did not know at
noverb:  moment the police might not take it into their heads
active:  to search me and my room
active:  There was no place
noverb:  about the hotel
active:  it would be safe
active:  I went out
noverb:  as
noverb:  on some commission
active:  I made for my sister's house
active:  She had married a man
active:  named Oakshott
novoice: lived in Brixton Road
active:  she fattened fowls for the market
noverb:  All the way there every man
active:  I met
novoice: seemed to me
active:  to be a policeman or a detective
noverb:  and,
noverb:  for all
active:  it was a cold night
active:  the sweat was pouring down my face
active:  I came to the Brixton Road
active:  My sister asked me
active:  was the matter
active:  I was so pale
active:  I told her
passive: I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel
active:  Then I went into the back yard
active:  smoked a pipe
novoice: wondered
active:  it would be best
active:  to do
noverb:  I had a friend once called Maudsley
active:  went to the bad
active:  has just been serving his time in Pentonville
noverb:  One day
active:  he had met me
noverb:  fell into talk about the ways of thieves
active:  they could get rid of
active:  they stole
active:  I knew
active:  he would be true
noverb:  to me
noverb:  for I knew one or two things about him
active:  I made up my mind
active:  to go right on to Kilburn
active:  he lived
active:  take him into my confidence
active:  He would show me
active:  to turn the stone into money
active:  to get to him in safety
active:  I thought of the agonies
active:  I had gone through
active:  coming from the hotel
active:  I might
passive: at any moment be seized and searched
active:  there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket
active:  I was leaning against the wall at the time
active:  looking at the geese
active:  were waddling about round my feet
active:  suddenly an idea came into my head
active:  showed me
active:  I could beat the best detective
active:  ever lived
noverb:  My sister had told me some weeks
active:  I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present
active:  I knew
active:  she was always
noverb:  her word
active:  I would take my goose now
noverb:  in it
active:  I would carry my stone to Kilburn
active:  There was a little shed in the yard
noverb:  behind this
active:  I drove one of the birds
noverb:  a fine big one
noverb:  white
noverb:  with a barred tail
active:  I caught it
active:  prying its bill open
active:  I thrust the stone down its throat
active:  my finger could reach
active:  The bird gave a gulp
active:  I felt the stone pass along its gullet
noverb:  down into its crop
novoice: the creature flapped and struggled
active:  came my sister
active:  to know
active:  was the matter
active:  As I turned
active:  to speak to her the brute broke loose
novoice: fluttered off among the others
active:  were you doing with
noverb:  bird
noverb:  Jem
active:  says she
noverb:  Well,
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you said
noverb:  you'd give me one for Christmas
active:  I was feeling
active:  was the fattest
noverb:  Oh
active:  says she
noverb:  we've set yours aside for you
noverb:  Jem's bird
active:  we call it
noverb:  It's the big white one over yonder
active:  There's twenty-six of them
active:  makes one for you
noverb:  one for us
noverb:  two dozen for the market
active:  Thank
active:  you, Maggie,' says I
active:  it is all
noverb:  the same to you
active:  I'd rather have
noverb:  one
active:  I was handling just now
noverb:  The other is a good three pound heavier
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  we fattened it expressly for you
noverb:  Never mind
active:  I'll have the other
active:  I'll take it now
active:  said I.
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  just as you
active:  said
noverb:  she
active:  a little huffed
noverb:  is it you want
noverb:  That white one with the barred tail
noverb:  right in the middle of the flock
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  very well
noverb:  Kill it
noverb:  take it with you
noverb:  Well,

active:  Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
noverb:  One moment
active:  said Holmes
active:  are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
active:  Could you swear to
noverb:  it
active:  That was

active:  there are nearly always some
noverb:  there
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  did you gather from this allusion to a band
noverb:  a speckled band
active:  Sometimes I have thought

noverb:  sometimes
active:  it may have referred to some band of people
noverb:  perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
active:  I do not know
noverb:  the spotted handkerchiefs

active:  it was daylight
active:  I slipped down
active:  got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn
active:  is opposite
active:  drove to Leatherhead
noverb:  from whence I have come on this morning with the one object
active:  seeing you
active:  asking your advice
active:  You have done wisely
active:  said my friend
active:  have you told me all
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  all
noverb:  Miss Roylott
active:  you have not
active:  You are screening your stepfather
noverb:  do you mean
active:  For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace
active:  fringed the hand
active:  lay upon our visitor's knee
noverb:  Five little livid spots
noverb:  the marks of four fingers and a thumb
passive: were printed upon the white wrist
passive: You have been cruelly used
active:  said Holmes
active:  The lady coloured deeply
novoice: covered over her injured wrist
active:  He is a hard man
active:  she said
active:  and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
active:  There was a long silence
noverb:  during
active:  Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands
novoice: stared into the crackling fire
active:  This is a very deep business
active:  he said at last
active:  There are a thousand details
active:  I should desire to know
active:  I decide upon our course of action
active:  Yet we have not a moment
active:  to lose
active:  we were
active:  to come to Stoke Moran to-day
active:  would
active:  it be possible
noverb:  for us
active:  to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
active:  it happens
noverb:  he spoke
active:  coming into town to-day upon some most important business
active:  It is probable
noverb:  that he will be away all day
active:  there would be nothing
active:  to disturb you
active:  We have a housekeeper now
active:  she is old and foolish
active:  I could easily get her out of the way
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You are not averse
noverb:  to this trip, Watson
noverb:  By no means
active:  we shall
active:  come
active:  are you going to do yourself
active:  I have one or two things
active:  I would wish to do now
active:  I am in town
active:  But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train
active:  to be there in time for your coming
active:  And you may expect us early in the afternoon
noverb:  I have myself some small business matters
active:  to attend to
active:  Will you not wait and breakfast
noverb:  No
active:  I must go
passive: My heart is lightened already
active:  I have confided my trouble to you
noverb:  I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
active:  She dropped her thick black veil over her face
novoice: glided from the room
noverb:  And
noverb:  do you think of it all
noverb:  Watson
active:  asked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  leaning back in his chair
active:  It seems to me
active:  to be a most dark and sinister business
noverb:  Dark enough
noverb:  sinister enough
noverb:  Yet
active:  the lady is correct
active:  saying
noverb:  the flooring
active:  walls are sound
active:  the door, window, and chimney are impassable
active:  her sister must have been undoubtedly alone
noverb:  she met her mysterious end
active:  becomes
noverb:  , of these nocturnal whistles,
noverb:  of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
active:  I cannot think
active:  When you combine the ideas of whistles at night
noverb:  the presence of a band of gipsies
active:  are on intimate terms with this old doctor
noverb:  the fact
active:  we have every reason
active:  to believe
active:  the doctor has an interest
active:  preventing his stepdaughter's marriage
noverb:  the dying allusion to a band
noverb:  finally
noverb:  the fact
novoice: Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang
passive: might have been caused by one of those metal bars
active:  secured the shutters falling back into its place
active:  I think
passive: there is good ground
active:  to think
passive: the mystery may be cleared along those lines
active:  did the gipsies
active:  do
active:  I cannot imagine
active:  I see many objections to any such theory
noverb:  And
active:  do
active:  I. It is precisely for
noverb:  reason
active:  we are going to Stoke Moran this day
active:  I want
active:  to see
active:  the objections are fatal
passive: they may be explained away
noverb:  in the name of the devil
passive: The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact
active:  our door had been suddenly dashed open
active:  a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
active:  His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional
noverb:  of the agricultural
active:  having a black top-hat
noverb:  , a long frock-coat
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a pair of high gaiters
noverb:  with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand
noverb:  So tall was he
active:  his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway
active:  his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
noverb:  A large face
passive: seared with a thousand wrinkles
noverb:  burned yellow with the sun
novoice: marked with every evil passion
passive: was turned from one to the other of us
noverb:  his deep-set, bile-shot eyes
noverb:  his high
noverb:  thin
noverb:  fleshless nose
noverb:  gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
noverb:  of
active:  you is Holmes
active:  asked this apparition
noverb:  My name
noverb:  sir
active:  you have the advantage of me
active:  said my companion quietly
active:  I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  , of Stoke Moran
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said Holmes blandly
noverb:  Pray take a seat
active:  I will do nothing of the kind
active:  My stepdaughter has been here
active:  I have traced her
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  It is a little cold for the time of the year
active:  said Holmes
passive: has
active:  she been saying to
noverb:  you
active:  screamed the old man furiously
active:  I have heard
noverb:  the crocuses promise well
active:  continued my companion imperturbably
noverb:  Ha
active:  You put me off
active:  do you
active:  said
noverb:  our new visitor
active:  taking a step forward
active:  shaking his hunting-crop
active:  I know you
noverb:  you scoundrel
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you before
active:  You are Holmes, the meddler
active:  My friend smiled
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the busybody
active:  His smile broadened
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office
active:  Holmes chuckled heartily
active:  Your conversation is most entertaining
active:  said he
active:  When you go out close the door
active:  for there is a decided draught
active:  I will go
active:  I have said my say
noverb:  Don't you dare
active:  to meddle with my affairs
active:  I know
active:  Miss Stoner has been here
active:  I traced her
active:  I am a dangerous man
active:  to fall foul of
noverb:  See here
active:  He stepped swiftly forward
active:  seized the poker
active:  bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
active:  See
active:  you keep yourself out of my grip
active:  he snarled
active:  hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace
active:  he strode out of the room
active:  He seems a very amiable person
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I am not quite so bulky
active:  he had remained
active:  I might have shown him
active:  my grip was not much more feeble
noverb:  his own
active:  he spoke
active:  he picked up the steel poker
active:  , with a sudden effort, straightened it out again
noverb:  Fancy his having the insolence
active:  to confound me with the official detective force
noverb:  This incident gives zest to our investigation
noverb:  however
noverb:  I only trust
active:  our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence
active:  allowing this brute
active:  to trace her
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall order breakfast
active:  afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons
active:  I hope to get some data
active:  may help us in this matter
active:  It was nearly one
noverb:  o'clock
novoice: Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion
active:  He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper
noverb:  scrawled over with notes and figures
active:  I have seen the will of the deceased wife
active:  said he
active:  To determine its exact meaning
passive: I have been obliged
active:  to work out the present prices of the investments with
passive: it is concerned
noverb:  The total income
active:  at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100
active:  is now
noverb:  through the fall in agricultural prices
noverb:  not more than $750
active:  Each daughter can claim an income of $250
noverb:  in case of marriage
active:  It is evident
noverb:  , therefore
active:  both girls had married
active:  this beauty would have had a mere pittance
active:  even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
passive: My morning's work has not been wasted
active:  it has proved
active:  he has the very strongest motives
active:  standing in the way of anything of the sort
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Watson
active:  this is too serious for dawdling
noverb:  especially
active:  the old man is aware
active:  we are interesting ourselves in his affairs
active:  you are ready
noverb:  , we shall call a cab
noverb:  drive to Waterloo
active:  I should be very much obliged
active:  you would slip your revolver into your pocket
noverb:  An Eley's No
active:  2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
active:  can twist steel pokers into knots
active:  a tooth-brush are
active:  I think
noverb:  all
active:  we need
noverb:  At Waterloo
active:  we were fortunate
noverb:  in catching a train for Leatherhead
active:  we hired a trap at the station inn
active:  drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes
active:  It was a perfect day
noverb:  with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
noverb:  The trees
active:  wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots
active:  the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
noverb:  To me at least
active:  there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon
passive: we were engaged
noverb:  My companion sat in the front of the trap
noverb:  his arms folded
active:  his hat pulled down over his eyes
active:  his chin sunk upon his breast
active:  buried in the deepest thought
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  he started
active:  tapped me on the shoulder
novoice: pointed over the meadows
noverb:  Look there
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
noverb:  thickening into a grove at the highest point
noverb:  From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
noverb:  high roof-tree of a very old mansion
noverb:  Stoke Moran
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  remarked the driver
active:  There is some building going on there
active:  said Holmes
active:  that is
active:  we are going
active:  There's the village
active:  said the driver
active:  pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left
active:  you want
active:  to get to the house
active:  you'll find it shorter
active:  to get over this stile
noverb:  by the foot-path over the fields
noverb:  There
active:  it is
active:  the lady is walking
noverb:  And the lady
active:  I fancy
active:  is Miss Stoner
active:  observed Holmes
active:  shading his eyes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I think
active:  we had
active:  better do
active:  you suggest
active:  We got off
active:  paid our fare
active:  the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
active:  I thought it as well
active:  said Holmes
active:  we climbed the stile
active:  this fellow should think
active:  we had come here as architects
noverb:  on some definite business
active:  It may stop his gossip
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  You see
active:  we have been
noverb:  our word
active:  Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
noverb:  spoke her joy
active:  I have been waiting
noverb:  eagerly for you
active:  she cried
noverb:  shaking hands with us warmly
noverb:  All has turned out splendidly
active:  Dr. Roylott has gone to town
active:  it is unlikely
noverb:  that he will be back
noverb:  before evening
active:  We have had the pleasure
active:  making the doctor's acquaintance
active:  said Holmes
active:  in a few words he sketched out
active:  had occurred
active:  Miss Stoner turned white to the lips
active:  she listened
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  she cried
active:  he has followed me
active:  it appears
active:  He is so cunning
noverb:  that I never know
active:  I am safe
noverb:  from him
active:  will he say
active:  he returns
active:  He must guard himself
noverb:  for he may find
active:  there is someone
noverb:  more cunning
noverb:  himself upon his track
active:  You must lock yourself up from him to-night
active:  he is violent
noverb:  , we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow
noverb:  Now,
active:  we must make the best use of our time
noverb:  kindly take us at once to the rooms
active:  we are
active:  to examine
active:  The building was of grey
noverb:  lichen-blotched stone
noverb:  with a high central portion
active:  two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side
passive: In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards
passive: the roof was partly caved in
noverb:  a picture of ruin
active:  The central portion was in little better repair
active:  the right-hand block was comparatively modern
noverb:  the blinds in the windows
active:  with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys
active:  showed
active:  this was
active:  the family resided
passive: Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall
passive: the stone-work had been broken into
active:  there were no signs
noverb:  of any workmen at the moment of our visit
active:  Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn
active:  examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
noverb:  This
active:  I take it
active:  belongs to the room in
noverb:  you used
active:  to sleep
noverb:  the centre one to your sister's
noverb:  the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber
noverb:  Exactly
active:  But I am now sleeping in the middle one
active:  Pending the alterations
active:  I understand
noverb:  By the way
active:  there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at
noverb:  end wall
active:  There were none
active:  I believe
active:  it was an excuse
active:  to move me from my room
noverb:  Ah!
active:  is suggestive
noverb:  Now,
active:  on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from
active:  these three rooms open
active:  There are windows
noverb:  in it
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  very small ones
noverb:  Too narrow for anyone
active:  to pass through
noverb:  As you
active:  locked your doors at night
active:  your rooms were unapproachable from
noverb:  side
noverb:  Now,
active:  would you have the kindness
active:  to go into your room
noverb:  bar your shutters
active:  Miss Stoner did
noverb:  Holmes
noverb:  after a careful examination through the open window
active:  endeavoured in every way
active:  to force the shutter open
noverb:  without success
active:  There was no slit through
passive: a knife could be passed
active:  to raise the bar
noverb:  with his lens
active:  he tested the hinges
active:  they were of solid iron
active:  built firmly into the massive masonry
noverb:  Hum
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  scratching his chin in some perplexity
active:  my theory certainly presents some difficulties
active:  No one could pass these shutters
passive: they were bolted
noverb:  Well,
active:  we shall see
noverb:  the inside throws any light upon the matter
passive: A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from
active:  the three bedrooms opened
active:  Holmes refused
active:  to examine the third chamber
active:  we passed at once to the second
noverb:  in
active:  Miss Stoner was now sleeping
noverb:  in
active:  her sister had met with her fate
active:  It was a homely little room
noverb:  with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace
noverb:  after the fashion of old country-houses
active:  A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner
noverb:  a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another
noverb:  a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window
active:  These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre
noverb:  The boards round
active:  the panelling of the walls were of brown
noverb:  worm-eaten oak
noverb:  old
active:  discoloured
active:  it may have dated from the original building of the house
active:  Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner
active:  sat silent
active:  his eyes travelled round
noverb:  round
noverb:  up and down
noverb:  taking in every detail of the apartment
active:  Where does
active:  bell communicate with
active:  he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope
active:  hung down beside the bed
active:  the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
active:  It goes to the housekeeper's room
active:  It looks newer
noverb:  the other things
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  it was only put there a couple of years ago
novoice: Your sister asked for
noverb:  it
active:  I suppose
noverb:  No
active:  I never heard of her using it
active:  We used always to get
active:  we wanted for ourselves
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it seemed unnecessary
active:  to put
noverb:  nice a bell-pull there
active:  You will excuse me for a few minutes
active:  I satisfy myself as to this floor
active:  He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
active:  crawled swiftly backward and forward
active:  examining minutely the cracks between the boards
active:  he did the same with the wood-work with
passive: the chamber was panelled
active:  Finally he walked over to the bed
novoice: spent some time
active:  staring at
noverb:  it
active:  running his eye up and down the wall
active:  Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand
noverb:  gave it a brisk tug
active:  it's a dummy
active:  said he
noverb:  Won't
active:  it ring
noverb:  No
passive: it is not even attached to a wire
active:  This is very interesting
active:  You can see now
passive: it is fastened to a hook just above
active:  the little opening for the ventilator is
noverb:  very absurd
active:  I never noticed
noverb:  before
noverb:  Very strange
active:  muttered Holmes
noverb:  pulling at the rope
noverb:  There are one or two very singular points about this room
noverb:  For example
noverb:  a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room
active:  , with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the
noverb:  air
active:  That is also quite modern
active:  said the lady
active:  Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
active:  remarked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  there were several little changes carried out about
noverb:  time
active:  They seem
novoice: to have been of a most interesting character
noverb:  dummy bell-ropes
noverb:  ventilators
active:  do not ventilate
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
active:  Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger
noverb:  of his step-daughter
active:  was as plainly furnished
noverb:  A camp-bed
noverb:  a small wooden shelf full of books
noverb:  , mostly of a technical character
noverb:  an armchair beside the bed
active:  a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron
active:  safe were the principal things
active:  met the eye
active:  Holmes walked slowly round
novoice: examined each
noverb:  all of them with the keenest interest
active:  What's in here
active:  he asked
active:  tapping the safe
noverb:  My stepfather's business papers
noverb:  Oh! you have seen inside
noverb:  Only once
noverb:  some years ago
active:  I remember
active:  it was full
noverb:  of papers
noverb:  There isn't a cat in it
noverb:  for example
noverb:  No
noverb:  a strange idea
noverb:  Well,
active:  look at this
active:  He took up a small saucer of milk
novoice: stood on the top of it
noverb:  No
noverb:  we don't keep a cat
active:  there is a cheetah and a baboon
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
noverb:  of course
noverb:  Well,
active:  a cheetah is just a big cat
active:  a saucer of milk does not go very far
active:  satisfying its wants
active:  I daresay
active:  There is one point
active:  I should wish
active:  to determine
active:  He squatted down in front of the wooden chair
active:  examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
active:  Thank you
active:  That is quite settled
active:  said he
active:  rising and putting his lens in his pocket
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Here is something interesting
noverb:  The object
active:  had caught
noverb:  his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
noverb:  The lash
noverb:  however
active:  was curled upon itself
noverb:  tied
active:  to make a loop of whipcord
noverb:  do you make of
noverb:  Watson
active:  It's a common enough lash
noverb:  But I don't know
passive: it should be tied
active:  That is not quite
noverb:  common
active:  is it
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  me! it's a wicked world
active:  a clever man turns his brains
active:  to crime
active:  it is the worst of all
active:  I think
active:  I have seen enough now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
noverb:  with your permission
active:  we shall walk out upon the lawn
active:  I had never seen my friend's face so grim
noverb:  his brow
noverb:  dark
active:  it was
active:  we turned from the scene of this investigation
active:  We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking
active:  to break in upon his thoughts
active:  he roused himself from his reverie
active:  It is very essential
noverb:  , Miss Stoner
active:  said he
active:  you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
active:  I shall most certainly do
active:  The matter is too serious for any hesitation
active:  Your life may depend upon your compliance
active:  I assure you
active:  I am in your hands
noverb:  In the first place
noverb:  my friend
active:  I must spend the night in your room
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  I gazed at him in astonishment
noverb:  Yes
active:  it must be
noverb:  Let me explain
active:  I believe
active:  is the village inn over there
noverb:  Yes
active:  that is the Crown
noverb:  Very good
active:  Your windows would be visible from there
noverb:  Certainly
active:  You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
active:  your stepfather comes back
noverb:  you hear him retire for the night
active:  you must open the shutters of your window
active:  undo the hasp
noverb:  put your lamp there as a signal to us
active:  withdraw quietly with everything
active:  you are likely
active:  to want into the room
active:  you used
active:  to occupy
active:  I have no doubt
active:  , in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
noverb:  easily
noverb:  The rest
active:  you will leave in our hands
active:  will
active:  you do
active:  We shall spend the night in your room
active:  we shall investigate the cause of this noise
active:  has disturbed you
active:  I believe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have already made up your mind
active:  said Miss Stoner
active:  laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
active:  Perhaps I have
active:  , for pity's sake, tell me
active:  was the cause of my sister's death
active:  I should prefer to have clearer proofs
active:  I speak
active:  You can at least tell me
active:  my own thought is correct
active:  she died from some sudden fright
noverb:  No
active:  I do not think
active:  I think
active:  there was probably some
noverb:  more tangible cause
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Miss Stoner
active:  we must leave you for
novoice: Dr. Roylott returned and saw us
active:  our journey would be in vain
noverb:  Good-bye
active:  be brave
noverb:  for
active:  you will do
active:  I have told you
active:  you may rest assured
noverb:  we shall soon drive away the dangers
active:  threaten you
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  engaging a bedroom
noverb:  sitting-room at the Crown Inn
active:  They were on the upper floor
noverb:  from our window
active:  we could command a view of the avenue gate
noverb:  of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House
active:  At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  drive past
active:  his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad
active:  drove him
active:  The boy had some slight difficulty
active:  undoing the heavy iron gates
active:  we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice
active:  saw the fury with
active:  he shook his clinched fists at him
active:  The trap drove on
noverb:  a few minutes later we saw a sudden light
active:  spring up among the trees
passive: the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
active:  Do you know
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness
active:  I have really some scruples as
active:  to taking you to-night
active:  There is a distinct element of danger
active:  Can I be of assistance
active:  Your presence might be invaluable
active:  I shall certainly come
active:  It is very kind
noverb:  of you
active:  You speak of danger
active:  You have evidently seen more in these rooms
active:  was visible to me
noverb:  No
active:  I fancy
active:  I may have deduced a little
active:  I imagine
active:  you saw all
active:  I did
noverb:  I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope
noverb:  purpose
active:  could answer
active:  I confess
active:  is more than
active:  I can imagine
active:  You saw the ventilator
noverb:  too
noverb:  Yes
active:  I do not think
active:  it is such
noverb:  a very unusual thing
active:  to have a small
active:  opening between two rooms
active:  It was so small
noverb:  that a rat could hardly pass through
active:  I knew
active:  we should find a ventilator
active:  we came to Stoke Moran
noverb:  My dear Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I did
active:  You remember in her statement
active:  she said
active:  her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  of course
active:  suggested at once
active:  there must be a communication
noverb:  between the two rooms
noverb:  It could only be a small one
passive: it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
active:  I deduced a ventilator
noverb:  harm can there be in that
noverb:  Well,
active:  there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
passive: A ventilator is made
passive: a cord is hung
noverb:  a lady
noverb:  sleeps in the bed dies
active:  Does not
active:  strike you
active:  I cannot as yet see any connection
active:  Did you observe anything very peculiar
noverb:  about
noverb:  bed
noverb:  No
passive: It was clamped to the floor
active:  Did you
noverb:  see a bed fastened like
noverb:  before
active:  I cannot say
active:  I have
noverb:  The lady could not move her bed
active:  It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator
noverb:  to the rope
active:  we may call it
passive: it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I cried
active:  I seem
active:  to see dimly
active:  you are hinting at
active:  We are only just in time
active:  to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
noverb:  Subtle enough and horrible enough
active:  When a doctor does go wrong
active:  he is the first of criminals
active:  He has nerve
active:  he has knowledge
noverb:  Palmer
active:  Pritchard were among the heads of their profession
noverb:  This man strikes even deeper
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we shall be able
active:  to strike deeper still
active:  we shall have horrors enough
active:  the night is over
noverb:  for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe
noverb:  turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
noverb:  About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
noverb:  all was dark in the direction of the Manor House
active:  Two hours passed slowly away
noverb:  suddenly
noverb:  just at the stroke of eleven
active:  a single bright light shone out right in front of us
active:  That is our signal
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  springing to his feet
active:  it comes from the middle window
active:  we passed out
active:  he exchanged a few words with the landlord
active:  explaining
active:  we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that we might spend the night there
noverb:  A moment later
active:  we were out on the dark road
noverb:  a chill wind blowing in our faces
noverb:  one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom
active:  to guide us on our sombre errand
active:  There was little difficulty
active:  entering the grounds
noverb:  for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
noverb:  Making our way among the trees
active:  we reached the lawn
active:  crossed it
active:  were about
active:  to enter through the window
noverb:  out from a clump of laurel bushes there
novoice: darted
novoice: seemed
active:  to be a hideous
noverb:  distorted child
active:  threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs
active:  ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
noverb:  My God
active:  I whispered
active:  did you see it
active:  Holmes was for the moment
active:  I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
active:  he broke into a low laugh
novoice: put his lips to my ear
active:  It is a nice household
active:  he murmured
active:  That is the baboon
active:  I had forgotten the strange pets
active:  the doctor affected
active:  There was a cheetah
noverb:  too
active:  perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
active:  I confess
active:  I felt easier in my mind
noverb:  after following Holmes' example
active:  slipping off my shoes
active:  I found myself inside the bedroom
active:  My companion noiselessly closed the shutters
active:  moved the lamp onto the table
noverb:  cast his eyes round the room
noverb:  All was
active:  we had seen it in the daytime
active:  creeping up to me
active:  making a trumpet of his hand
active:  he whispered into my ear again
noverb:  gently
active:  it was all
noverb:  that I could do to distinguish the words
active:  The least sound would be fatal to our plans
active:  I nodded to show
active:  I had heard
active:  We must sit without light
active:  He would see it through the ventilator
active:  I nodded again
active:  Do not go asleep
active:  your very life may depend upon
noverb:  it
active:  Have your pistol
active:  ready in case
active:  we should need it
active:  I will sit on the side of the bed
noverb:  you in
noverb:  chair
active:  I took out my revolver
active:  laid it on the corner of the table
active:  Holmes had brought up a long thin cane
noverb:  this
active:  he placed upon the bed beside him
active:  By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
active:  he turned down the lamp
passive: we were left in darkness
active:  shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil
active:  I could not hear a sound
noverb:  not even the drawing of a breath
active:  I knew
noverb:  my companion sat open-eyed
noverb:  within a few feet of me
noverb:  in the same state of nervous tension in
active:  I was myself
active:  The shutters cut off the least ray of light
active:  we waited in absolute darkness
noverb:  From
active:  came the occasional cry of a night-bird
noverb:  once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine
active:  told us
active:  the cheetah was indeed at liberty
noverb:  Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock
active:  boomed out every quarter of an hour
noverb:  long they seemed
noverb:  those quarters
active:  Twelve struck
noverb:  one
noverb:  two
noverb:  three
active:  still we sat waiting silently for
active:  might befall
noverb:  Suddenly
active:  there was the momentary gleam
noverb:  of a light up in the direction of the ventilator
passive: vanished immediately
passive: was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil
noverb:  heated metal
active:  Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern
active:  I heard a gentle sound of movement
noverb:  all was silent once
active:  the smell grew stronger
noverb:  For half an hour
active:  I sat with straining ears
active:  suddenly another sound became audible
noverb:  a very gentle
noverb:  soothing sound
noverb:  like
active:  of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
noverb:  The instant
active:  we heard it
active:  Holmes sprang from the bed
active:  struck a match
novoice: lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
active:  You see it, Watson
active:  he yelled
active:  You see it
active:  I saw nothing
active:  At the moment when Holmes struck the light
active:  I heard a low
noverb:  clear whistle
active:  the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me
active:  to tell
active:  it was at
novoice: my friend lashed
noverb:  savagely
active:  I could
noverb:  however
noverb:  see
active:  his face was deadly pale
novoice: filled with horror and loathing
active:  He had ceased
active:  to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator
active:  suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to
active:  I have ever listened
active:  It swelled up louder
noverb:  louder
noverb:  a hoarse yell of pain
noverb:  fear
noverb:  anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
active:  They say
noverb:  away down in the village
noverb:  even in the distant parsonage
active:  that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
active:  It struck cold to our hearts
active:  I stood
active:  gazing at Holmes
noverb:  he at me
active:  until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from
active:  it rose
active:  can it mean
active:  I gasped
active:  It means
active:  it is all
noverb:  over
active:  Holmes answered
active:  And perhaps, after all, it is for the best
noverb:  Take your pistol
active:  we will enter Dr. Roylott's room
active:  With a grave face he lit the lamp
active:  led the way down the corridor
active:  Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
active:  he turned the handle
active:  entered
noverb:  I at his heels
noverb:  with the cocked pistol in my hand
active:  It was a singular sight
active:  met our eyes
active:  On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open
active:  throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe
noverb:  the door of
active:  was ajar
active:  Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
active:  clad in a long grey dressing-gown
active:  his bare ankles protruding beneath
active:  his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers
active:  Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash
active:  we had noticed during the day
passive: His chin was cocked upward
passive: his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
noverb:  Round his brow
active:  he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles,
active:  seemed to be bound tightly round his head
active:  we entered
active:  he made
noverb:  sound
noverb:  motion
noverb:  The band! the speckled band
noverb:  whispered Holmes
active:  I took a step forward
active:  In an instant his strange headgear began
active:  to move
active:  there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head
noverb:  puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
active:  It is a swamp adder
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  the deadliest snake in India
active:  He has died within ten seconds
passive: being bitten
active:  Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent
noverb:  the schemer falls into the pit
active:  he digs for another
noverb:  Let us thrust this creature back into its den
active:  we can
noverb:  remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter
noverb:  let the county police know
active:  has happened
active:  he spoke
active:  he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
noverb:  throwing the noose round the reptile's neck
active:  he drew it from its horrid perch
active:  carrying it at arm's length
active:  threw it into the iron safe
active:  he closed upon
noverb:  it
active:  Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott
noverb:  of Stoke Moran
active:  It is not necessary
noverb:  that I should prolong a narrative
active:  has already run to too great a length
active:  telling
active:  we broke the sad news to the terrified girl
active:  we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow
noverb:  of
active:  the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion
novoice: the doctor met his fate
active:  indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
noverb:  The little
active:  I had yet
active:  to learn
active:  of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
active:  I had
active:  said he
active:  come to an entirely erroneous conclusion
noverb:  shows
noverb:  my dear Watson
noverb:  dangerous it always is
active:  to reason from insufficient data
noverb:  The presence of the gipsies
noverb:  the use of the word 'band
passive: was used by the poor girl, no doubt,
active:  to explain the appearance
active:  she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match
active:  were sufficient
active:  to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
active:  I can only claim the merit
noverb:  I
active:  reconsidered my position
noverb:  however
active:  it became clear to me
active:  danger threatened an occupant of the room
active:  could not come
noverb:  from the window or the door
passive: My attention was speedily drawn
active:  I have already remarked to
noverb:  you, to this ventilator,
noverb:  to the bell-rope
active:  hung down to the bed
noverb:  The discovery
active:  this was a dummy
passive: the bed was clamped to the floor
active:  gave rise to the suspicion
active:  the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole
noverb:  coming to the bed
noverb:  The idea of a snake
novoice: occurred to me
active:  I coupled it with my knowledge
passive: the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India
active:  I felt
active:  I was probably on the right track
noverb:  The idea
active:  using a form of poison
passive: could not possibly be discovered
active:  by any chemical test was just such a one
active:  would occur to a clever and ruthless man
active:  had had an Eastern training
noverb:  The rapidity with
active:  such a poison would take effect
noverb:  would also, from his point of view, be an advantage
active:  It would be a sharp-eyed coroner
noverb:  indeed
active:  could distinguish the two little dark punctures
active:  would show
active:  the poison fangs had done their work
noverb:  Then I thought of the whistle
noverb:  Of course he must recall the snake
active:  the morning light revealed it to the victim
active:  He had trained it
noverb:  probably by the use of the milk
active:  we saw
active:  to return to him
novoice: summoned
active:  He would put it through this ventilator at the hour
active:  he thought best
noverb:  with the certainty
active:  it would crawl down the rope
noverb:  land on the bed
active:  It might or might not bite the occupant
active:  perhaps she might escape every night for a week
noverb:  sooner
noverb:  later she must fall a victim
active:  I had come to these conclusions
active:  I had entered his room
active:  An inspection of his chair showed me
active:  he had been in the habit
active:  standing on
noverb:  it
noverb:  of course would be necessary in order
active:  he should reach the ventilator
noverb:  The sight of the safe
noverb:  the saucer of milk
active:  the loop of whipcord were enough
active:  to finally dispel any doubts
active:  may have remained
active:  The metallic clang heard
passive: by Miss Stoner was obviously caused
active:  by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
active:  Having once made up my mind
active:  you know the steps
active:  I took in order
active:  to put the matter to the proof
active:  I heard the creature hiss
active:  I have no doubt
active:  you did also
noverb:  I
active:  lit the light
active:  attacked it
noverb:  With the result
active:  driving it through the ventilator
noverb:  And also with the result
active:  causing it
active:  to turn upon its master at the other side
active:  Some of the blows of my cane came home
active:  roused its snakish temper
active:  it flew upon the first person
active:  it saw
noverb:  In this way
active:  I am no doubt
noverb:  indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death
active:  I cannot say
active:  it is likely
active:  to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
noverb:  IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
noverb:  Of all the problems
passive: have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy
active:  there were only two
noverb:  which I was the means
noverb:  of introducing to his notice
noverb:  of Mr. Hatherley's thumb
noverb:  of Colonel Warburton's madness
active:  Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer
active:  the other was so strange in its inception
noverb:  so dramatic in its details
active:  it may be the
noverb:  more worthy
passive: being placed upon record
noverb:  even
noverb:  it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods
active:  reasoning by
active:  he achieved such remarkable results
active:  The story has
active:  I believe
passive: been told more than once in the newspapers
active:  , like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking
noverb:  set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print
active:  the facts slowly evolve
noverb:  your own eyes
noverb:  the mystery clears gradually away
active:  each new discovery furnishes a step
active:  leads on to the complete truth
active:  At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me
active:  the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
active:  It was in the summer of '89
active:  not long after my marriage
active:  the events occurred
active:  I am now about
active:  to summarise
active:  I had returned to civil practice
active:  had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
active:  I continually visited him
active:  occasionally even persuaded him
active:  to forgo his Bohemian habits
active:  to come and visit us
active:  My practice had steadily increased
active:  I happened
active:  to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station
active:  I got a few patients from among the officials
noverb:  One of these
active:  I had cured of a painful
noverb:  lingering disease
active:  was never weary
active:  advertising my virtues
active:  endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over
active:  he might have any influence
noverb:  One morning
noverb:  at a little
noverb:  seven o'clock
passive: I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door
active:  to announce
active:  two men had come from Paddington
active:  were waiting in the consulting-room
active:  I dressed hurriedly
noverb:  for I knew by experience
active:  railway cases were seldom trivial
novoice: hastened downstairs
active:  As I descended
noverb:  my old ally
noverb:  the guard
active:  came out of the room
active:  closed the door tightly behind him
noverb:  I've got him here
active:  he whispered
active:  jerking his thumb over his shoulder
active:  he's all right
active:  is it
active:  I asked
active:  for his manner suggested
active:  it was some strange creature
noverb:  which he had caged up in my room
active:  It's a new patient
active:  he whispered
active:  I thought
noverb:  I'd bring him round myself
noverb:  he couldn't slip away
noverb:  There
active:  he is
noverb:  all safe
noverb:  sound
active:  I must go now
noverb:  Doctor
active:  I have my dooties
noverb:  just the same as you
noverb:  And off he went
noverb:  this trusty tout
noverb:  without even giving me time
active:  to thank him
active:  I entered my consulting-room
novoice: found
active:  a gentleman seated by the table
passive: He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
active:  he had laid down upon my books
active:  Round one of his hands
noverb:  he had a handkerchief wrapped
passive: was mottled all over with bloodstains
active:  He was young
noverb:  , not more than five-and-twenty
active:  I should say
noverb:  with a strong, masculine face
active:  he was exceedingly pale
noverb:  and gave me the impression of a man
active:  was suffering from some strong agitation
active:  it took all his strength of mind
active:  to control
active:  I am sorry
active:  to knock you up
noverb:  early
noverb:  Doctor
active:  said he
active:  I have had a very serious accident during the night
active:  I came in by train this morning
active:  inquiring at Paddington as to
active:  I might find a doctor
noverb:  a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here
noverb:  I gave the maid a card
active:  I see
active:  she has left it upon the side-table
active:  I took it up
active:  glanced at
noverb:  it
noverb:  Mr. Victor Hatherley
noverb:  hydraulic engineer
noverb:  16A
noverb:  Victoria Street (3rd floor)

noverb:  I have kept you waiting

active:  You are fresh
noverb:  from a night journey
active:  I understand
active:  is in itself a monotonous occupation
noverb:  Oh
active:  my night could not be called monotonous
active:  said he
novoice: laughed
active:  He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair
active:  shaking his sides
active:  All my medical instincts rose up against
noverb:  laugh
noverb:  Stop it
active:  I cried
active:  pull yourself together
active:  and I poured out some water from a caraffe
active:  It was useless
noverb:  , however
active:  He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts
active:  come upon a strong nature
active:  some great crisis is over
noverb:  gone
active:  Presently he came to himself once
noverb:  very weary
noverb:  pale-looking
active:  I have been making a fool of myself
active:  he gasped
noverb:  Not at all
active:  Drink this
active:  I dashed some brandy into the water
active:  the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
active:  That's better
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Doctor
noverb:  perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb
noverb:  rather to the place
passive: my thumb used
active:  to be
active:  He unwound the handkerchief
active:  held out his hand
noverb:  It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder
active:  to look at it
active:  There were four protruding fingers
noverb:  a horrid red, spongy surface
active:  the thumb should
passive: have been
passive: It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  this is a terrible injury
active:  It must have bled considerably
noverb:  Yes
active:  it did
active:  I fainted
passive: it was done
active:  I think
active:  I must have been senseless for a long time
active:  When I came to
noverb:  I found
active:  it was still bleeding
active:  I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist
active:  braced it up with a twig
noverb:  Excellent
active:  You should have been a surgeon
active:  It is a question of hydraulics
noverb:  you see
active:  came within my own province
passive: This has been done
active:  said I
active:  examining the wound
noverb:  by a very heavy and sharp instrument
noverb:  A thing
noverb:  a cleaver
active:  said he
noverb:  An accident
active:  I presume
noverb:  By no means
noverb:  ! a murderous attack
noverb:  Very murderous indeed
active:  You horrify me
active:  I sponged the wound
active:  cleaned it
active:  dressed it
active:  finally covered it over with cotton wadding
noverb:  carbolised bandages
active:  He lay back
active:  wincing
active:  he bit his lip from time to time
active:  is that
active:  I asked
active:  I had finished
noverb:  Capital
active:  Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man
active:  I was very weak
active:  I have had a good deal
active:  to go through
active:  Perhaps you had better not
active:  speak of the matter
active:  It is evidently trying to your nerves
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  not now
active:  I shall have to tell my tale to the police
noverb:  between ourselves
active:  it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine
passive: I should be surprised
active:  they believed my statement
noverb:  for it is a very extraordinary one
active:  I have not much in the way of proof with
active:  to back it up
noverb:  and,
noverb:  even
active:  they believe me
noverb:  the clues
active:  I can give
active:  them are so vague
noverb:  that it is a question
noverb:  whether justice will be done
noverb:  Ha
active:  cried I
active:  it is anything
noverb:  in the nature of a problem
noverb:  you desire
active:  to see solved
active:  I should strongly recommend you
active:  to come to my friend
noverb:  Mr. Sherlock Holmes
active:  you go to the official police
noverb:  Oh
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  fellow
active:  answered my visitor
active:  and I should be very glad
active:  he would take the matter up
noverb:  of course I must use the official police as well
noverb:  Would you give me an introduction to him
active:  I'll do better
noverb:  I'll take you round to him myself
passive: I should be immensely obliged to
noverb:  you
active:  We'll call a cab
active:  go together

noverb:  Yes

passive: was composed
novoice: of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before

passive: When it was concluded
active:  he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa
active:  placed a pillow beneath his head
active:  laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
active:  It is easy
active:  to see
noverb:  your experience has been no common one
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said he
active:  Pray
active:  lie down there
active:  make yourself absolutely at home
active:  Tell us
active:  you can
noverb:  stop
passive: you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
active:  Thank you
active:  said my patient
active:  I have felt another man
active:  the doctor bandaged me
active:  I think
active:  your breakfast has completed the cure
active:  I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible
active:  I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
active:  Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
active:  veiled his keen and eager nature
active:  I sat opposite to him
active:  we listened in silence to the strange story
active:  our visitor detailed to us
active:  You must know
active:  said he

active:  having served my time
active:  having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death
active:  I determined
active:  to start in business for myself
active:  took professional chambers in Victoria Street
active:  I suppose
active:  everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience
active:  To me it has been exceptionally
active:  During two years I have had three consultations
noverb:  one small job
active:  is absolutely all
active:  my profession has brought me
active:  My gross takings amount to $27 10s
noverb:  Every day
noverb:  from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon
active:  I waited in my little den
noverb:  until at last my heart began
active:  to sink
active:  I came to believe
active:  I should never have any practice at all
noverb:  Yesterday,
noverb:  however
noverb:  just
active:  I was thinking
active:  leaving the office
novoice: my clerk entered
active:  to say
active:  there was a gentleman
active:  waiting
active:  wished to see me upon business
active:  He brought up a card
noverb:  too
noverb:  with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon
noverb:  it
noverb:  Close at his heels came the colonel himself
noverb:  a man rather over the middle size
noverb:  of an exceeding thinness
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  thin a man
noverb:  His whole face sharpened away into nose
noverb:  chin
active:  the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones
active:  Yet this emaciation seemed
noverb:  to be his natural habit
noverb:  due to no disease
active:  for his eye was bright
noverb:  his step brisk
noverb:  his bearing assured
active:  He was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed
noverb:  his age
active:  I should judge
active:  would be nearer forty
noverb:  thirty
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  with something of a German accent
passive: You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,
active:  being a man
noverb:  who is not only proficient
noverb:  in his profession
active:  is also discreet and capable
active:  preserving a secret
active:  I bowed
noverb:  feeling
active:  any young man would at such an address
active:  May I ask
active:  it was
active:  gave me
noverb:  good a character
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  perhaps
active:  it is better
noverb:  that I should not tell you
noverb:  just at this moment
active:  I have it from the same source
active:  you are
noverb:  an orphan
noverb:  a bachelor
active:  are residing alone in London
active:  That is quite correct
active:  I answered
active:  you will excuse me
active:  I say
active:  I cannot see
noverb:  all this bears upon my professional qualifications
active:  I understand
active:  it was on a professional matter
active:  you wished
active:  to speak to me
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  you will find
noverb:  all I say
active:  is really to the point
active:  I have a professional commission for you
active:  absolute secrecy is quite essential
noverb:  absolute secrecy
active:  you understand
noverb:  of course we may expect
noverb:  from a man
active:  is alone
noverb:  from one
noverb:  lives in the bosom of his family
active:  I promise to keep a secret
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  you may absolutely depend upon my doing
active:  He looked very hard at me as I spoke
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  I had never seen so suspicious
active:  questioning an eye
noverb:  Do you promise
active:  said
noverb:  he at last
noverb:  Yes
active:  I promise
noverb:  Absolute
noverb:  complete silence before
noverb:  during
noverb:  after
noverb:  No reference to the matter at all
noverb:  in word or writing
noverb:  I have already given you my word
noverb:  Very good
active:  He suddenly sprang up
noverb:  darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door
noverb:  The passage
active:  was empty
active:  That's all right
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  coming back
active:  I know
active:  clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs
active:  Now we can talk in safety
active:  He drew up his chair very close
noverb:  to mine
active:  began
active:  to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
noverb:  A feeling of repulsion
noverb:  of something akin
active:  to fear
active:  had begun
active:  to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
noverb:  Even my dread
active:  losing a client
active:  could not restrain me
active:  showing my impatience
active:  I beg
active:  you will state your business, sir,
active:  said I
active:  my time is of value
active:  Heaven forgive me for that last sentence
active:  the words came to my lips
noverb:  would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you
active:  he asked
noverb:  Most admirably
active:  I say a night's work
noverb:  an hour's would be nearer the mark
active:  I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine
active:  has got out of gear
active:  you show us
active:  is wrong
active:  we shall soon set
active:  it right ourselves
noverb:  do you think of such a commission as that
active:  The work appears to be light
noverb:  the pay munificent
noverb:  Precisely
active:  We shall want you
active:  to come to-night by the last train
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  To Eyford
noverb:  in Berkshire
active:  It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire
noverb:  within seven miles of Reading
active:  There is a train
noverb:  from Paddington
noverb:  would bring you there at about 11
noverb:  15
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall come down in a carriage
active:  to meet you
active:  There is a drive
noverb:  Yes
active:  our little place is quite out in the country
noverb:  It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
active:  we can hardly get there
noverb:  midnight
active:  I suppose
active:  there would be no chance of a train back
passive: I should be compelled
active:  to stop the night
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  we could easily give you a shake-down
active:  That is very awkward
active:  Could I not come at some more convenient hour
active:  We have judged it best
active:  you should come late
active:  It is to recompense you for any inconvenience
active:  we are paying to
noverb:  you
noverb:  a young and unknown man
noverb:  a fee
active:  would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  you would like
active:  to draw out of the business
active:  there is plenty of time
active:  to do
active:  I thought of the fifty guineas
noverb:  of
noverb:  very useful they would be to me
noverb:  Not at all
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I shall be very happy
active:  to accommodate myself to your wishes
active:  I should like
noverb:  however
active:  to understand a little more clearly
active:  it is
active:  you wish me
active:  to do
noverb:  Quite
active:  It is very natural
noverb:  that the pledge of secrecy
active:  we have exacted from
active:  you should have aroused your curiosity
active:  I have no wish
active:  to commit you to anything without your having it all laid
noverb:  you
active:  I suppose
active:  we are absolutely safe
noverb:  from eavesdroppers
noverb:  Entirely
noverb:  the matter stands
active:  You are probably aware
noverb:  that fuller's-earth is a valuable product
passive: it is only found in one or two places in England
active:  I have heard
noverb:  Some little time ago
active:  I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading
active:  I was fortunate enough
active:  to discover
active:  there was a deposit
noverb:  of fuller's-earth in one of my fields
active:  examining it
noverb:  however
active:  I found
active:  this deposit was a comparatively small one
noverb:  it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
noverb:  left
noverb:  of them
noverb:  however
noverb:  in the grounds of my neighbours
active:  These good people were absolutely ignorant
active:  their land contained
active:  was quite
noverb:  a gold-mine
noverb:  Naturally,
active:  it was to my interest
active:  to buy their land
active:  they discovered its true value
active:  unfortunately I had no capital by
active:  I could do this
active:  I took a few of my friends into the secret
noverb:  however
active:  they suggested
active:  we should quietly
noverb:  secretly work our own little deposit
noverb:  in this way
active:  we should earn the money
active:  would enable us
active:  to buy the neighbouring fields
noverb:  This
active:  we have
active:  now been doing for some time
noverb:  in order
active:  to help us in our operations
active:  we erected a hydraulic press
noverb:  This press
active:  I have already explained
active:  has got out of order
active:  we wish your advice upon the subject
active:  We guard our secret very jealously
noverb:  however
active:  it once became known
active:  we had hydraulic engineers
active:  coming to our little house
active:  it would soon rouse inquiry
active:  the facts came out
active:  it would be good-bye
noverb:  to any chance
active:  getting these fields
active:  carrying out our plans
active:  That is
active:  I have made
active:  you promise me
active:  you will not tell a human being
active:  you are going to Eyford to-night
active:  I hope
active:  I make it all plain
noverb:  I quite follow you
active:  said I. 'The only point
active:  I could not quite understand
active:  was
active:  use
active:  you could make of a hydraulic press
active:  excavating fuller's-earth
active:  I understand
passive: is dug out
noverb:  gravel from a pit
noverb:  Ah
active:  said
noverb:  he carelessly
active:  we have our own process
active:  We compress the earth into bricks
active:  to remove them
active:  revealing
active:  they are
active:  is a mere detail
active:  I have taken you fully into my confidence now
noverb:  Mr. Hatherley
active:  I have shown you
active:  I trust you
active:  He rose as
active:  he spoke
active:  I shall expect you
noverb:  at Eyford at 11
noverb:  15
active:  I shall certainly be there
noverb:  And not a word to a soul
active:  He looked at me with a last long
noverb:  questioning gaze
active:  pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp
active:  he hurried from the room
noverb:  Well,
active:  I came to think it all over in cool blood
active:  I was very much astonished
noverb:  as you may
noverb:  think
noverb:  at this sudden commission
passive: had been intrusted to me
noverb:  On the one hand, of course,
active:  I was glad
noverb:  , for the fee was at least tenfold
active:  I should have asked
passive: had
active:  I set a price upon my own services
active:  it was possible
noverb:  that this order might lead to other ones
noverb:  On the other hand
active:  the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me
active:  I could not think
noverb:  his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient
active:  to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight
noverb:  his extreme anxiety
active:  I should tell anyone of my errand
noverb:  However,
active:  I threw all fears to the winds
active:  ate a hearty supper
active:  drove to Paddington
novoice: started off
active:  having obeyed to the letter the injunction as
active:  to holding my tongue
active:  At Reading I had to change not only my carriage
noverb:  my station
noverb:  However,
active:  I was in time for the last train to Eyford
active:  I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock
active:  I was the only passenger
noverb:  who got out there
active:  there was no one
noverb:  upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern
novoice: As I passed out through the wicket gate
noverb:  however
active:  I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
active:  Without a word he grasped my arm
active:  hurried me into a carriage
noverb:  the door of
active:  was standing open
active:  He drew up the windows on
noverb:  side
passive: tapped on the wood-work
noverb:  away we went
active:  the horse could go
noverb:  One horse
active:  interjected Holmes
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  only one
active:  Did you observe the colour
noverb:  Yes
active:  I saw it by the side-lights
active:  I was stepping into the carriage
active:  It was a chestnut
noverb:  Tired-looking
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  fresh
noverb:  glossy
active:  Thank you
active:  I am sorry
active:  to have interrupted you
active:  Pray
active:  continue your most interesting statement
noverb:  Away we went
active:  we drove for at least an hour
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark had said
active:  it was only seven miles
active:  I should think
noverb:  from the rate
active:  we seemed to go
noverb:  from the time
active:  we took
active:  it must have been nearer twelve
active:  He sat at my side in silence all the time
active:  I was aware
noverb:  , more than once
active:  I glanced in his direction
active:  he was looking at me with great intensity
active:  The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world
noverb:  for we lurched and jolted terribly
active:  I tried
active:  to look out of the windows
active:  to see something of
active:  we were
passive: they were made of frosted glass
noverb:  I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light
noverb:  Now
active:  I hazarded some remark
active:  to break the monotony of the journey
novoice: the colonel answered only in monosyllables
active:  the conversation soon flagged
noverb:  At last
noverb:  however
passive: the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
active:  the carriage came to a stand
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out
active:  I followed after him
active:  pulled me swiftly into a porch
active:  gaped in front of us
active:  We stepped
active:  it were
noverb:  right out of the carriage
noverb:  into the hall
active:  I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house
noverb:  The instant
active:  I had crossed the threshold
novoice: the door slammed heavily behind us
active:  I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels
active:  the carriage drove away
active:  It was pitch dark inside the house
novoice: the colonel fumbled
active:  looking for matches
active:  muttering under his breath
active:  Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage
active:  a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction
active:  It grew broader
novoice: a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand
active:  she held above her head
active:  pushing her face forward
active:  peering at us
active:  I could see
active:  she was pretty
noverb:  ,
noverb:  from the gloss with
active:  the light shone upon her dark dress I knew
active:  it was a rich material
active:  She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
active:  asking a question
novoice: my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable
active:  she gave such a start
active:  the lamp nearly fell from her hand
active:  Colonel Stark went up to her
noverb:  whispered something in her ear
active:  pushing her back into the room from whence she had come
active:  he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
active:  Perhaps you will have the kindness
active:  to wait in this room for a few minutes
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  throwing open another door
active:  It was a quiet
noverb:  little
noverb:  plainly furnished room
noverb:  with a round table in the centre
noverb:  on
passive: several German books were scattered
active:  Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door
noverb:  I shall not keep you waiting an instant
active:  said
noverb:  he
novoice: vanished into the darkness
active:  I glanced at the books upon the table
active:  in spite of my ignorance of German I could see
active:  two of them were treatises
noverb:  on science
active:  the others being volumes of poetry
novoice: Then I walked across to the window
active:  hoping
active:  I might catch some glimpse of the country-side
noverb:  an oak shutter
noverb:  heavily barred
active:  was folded across
noverb:  it
active:  It was a
noverb:  wonderfully silent house
active:  There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage
active:  everything was deadly still
active:  A vague feeling of uneasiness began
active:  to steal over me
active:  were these German people
active:  were they doing living in this strange
noverb:  out-of-the-way place
active:  And where was the place
active:  I was ten miles
noverb:  from Eyford
active:  that was all I knew
noverb:  north
noverb:  south
noverb:  east
noverb:  west I had no idea
noverb:  For
noverb:  matter
noverb:  Reading
noverb:  possibly other large towns
active:  were within that radius
active:  the place might not be so secluded
noverb:  after all
noverb:  Yet
active:  it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
noverb:  that we were in the country
active:  I paced up and down the room
active:  humming a tune under my breath
active:  to keep up my spirits
noverb:  feeling
active:  I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness
active:  the door of my room swung slowly open
active:  The woman was standing in the aperture
noverb:  the darkness of the hall behind her
noverb:  the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face
active:  I could see at a glance
active:  she was sick
noverb:  with fear
active:  the sight sent a chill to my own heart
active:  She held up one shaking finger
active:  to warn me
active:  to be silent
active:  she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me
active:  her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her
active:  I would go
active:  said
noverb:  she
noverb:  trying hard
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  to speak calmly
active:  I would go
active:  I should not stay here
active:  There is no good for you
active:  to do
noverb:  madam
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I have not yet done
active:  I came for
active:  I cannot possibly leave
active:  I have seen the machine
active:  It is not worth
noverb:  your
active:  to wait
active:  she went on
active:  You can pass through the door
active:  no one hinders
noverb:  And then,
noverb:  seeing
active:  I smiled and shook my head
active:  she suddenly threw aside her constraint
active:  made a step forward
noverb:  , with her hands wrung together
noverb:  For the love of Heaven
active:  she whispered
active:  get away from here
active:  it is too late
active:  I am somewhat headstrong
noverb:  by nature
noverb:  the
active:  ready to engage in an affair
active:  there is some obstacle
noverb:  in the way
active:  I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,
noverb:  of the unpleasant night
active:  seemed to be
noverb:  me
active:  Was it all
active:  to go for nothing
active:  should I slink away
active:  having carried out my commission
noverb:  without the payment
active:  was my due
active:  This woman might
noverb:  for all I knew
active:  be a monomaniac
noverb:  With a stout bearing
noverb:  therefore
active:  her manner had shaken me more than
active:  I cared to confess
noverb:  I still shook my head
active:  declared my intention
active:  remaining
active:  I was
active:  She was about
active:  to renew her entreaties
active:  a door slammed overhead
passive: the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs
active:  She listened for an instant
active:  threw up her hands with a despairing gesture
noverb:  vanished as suddenly
active:  she had come
active:  The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark
noverb:  a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin
passive: was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson
active:  This is my secretary
noverb:  manager
active:  said
noverb:  the colonel
noverb:  By the way
active:  I was under the impression
active:  I left this door shut just now
active:  I fear
active:  you have felt the draught
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  I opened the door myself
active:  I felt the room
active:  to be a little close
active:  He shot one of his suspicious looks at me
noverb:  Perhaps we
active:  had better
active:  proceed to business
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  Mr. Ferguson
active:  I will take you up
active:  to see the machine
noverb:  I had better put my hat on
active:  I suppose
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
active:  it is in the house
active:  you dig fuller's-earth in the house
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
active:  This is only
active:  we compress it
active:  never mind that
noverb:  All we wish you
active:  to do
active:  is to examine the machine
noverb:  to let us know
active:  is wrong with it
active:  We went upstairs together
noverb:  the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him
active:  It was a labyrinth of an old house
noverb:  , with corridors
noverb:  passages
active:  narrow winding staircases
noverb:  little low doors
noverb:  the thresholds of
passive: were hollowed out by the generations
active:  had crossed them
active:  There were no carpets
noverb:  no signs of any furniture above the ground floor
active:  the plaster was peeling off the walls
active:  the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches
active:  I tried
active:  to put on as unconcerned an air as possible
active:  I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady
active:  I disregarded them
active:  I kept a keen eye upon my two companions
active:  Ferguson appeared
active:  to be a morose and silent man
active:  I could see from the little
active:  he said
active:  he was at least a
noverb:  fellow-countryman
active:  Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last
noverb:  a low door
active:  he unlocked
active:  was a small
noverb:  square room
noverb:  in
active:  the three of us could hardly get at one time
active:  Ferguson remained
active:  the colonel ushered me in
active:  We are now
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  actually within the hydraulic press
active:  it would be a
noverb:  particularly unpleasant thing for us
active:  anyone were to turn it on
active:  The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston
active:  it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor
active:  There are small lateral columns of water
active:  receive the force
active:  transmit and multiply it in the manner
active:  is familiar to you
active:  The machine goes readily enough
active:  there is some stiffness
noverb:  in the working of it
active:  it has lost a little of its force
active:  Perhaps you will have the goodness
active:  to look it
active:  show us
noverb:  we can set it right
active:  I took the lamp from him
active:  I examined the machine very thoroughly
noverb:  It was indeed a gigantic one
noverb:  capable
active:  exercising enormous pressure
active:  When I passed
noverb:  however
novoice: pressed down the levers
active:  controlled it
active:  I knew at once by the whishing sound
active:  there was a slight leakage
active:  allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders
active:  An examination showed
noverb:  one of the india-rubber bands
active:  was round the head of a driving-rod
active:  had shrunk
noverb:  not quite
active:  to fill the socket along
novoice: it worked
active:  This was clearly the cause of the loss of power
active:  I pointed it out to my companions
active:  followed my remarks very carefully
active:  asked several practical questions as to
noverb:  they should proceed to set it right
active:  When I had made it clear to them
noverb:  , I returned to the main chamber of the machine
active:  took a good look at it
active:  to satisfy my own curiosity
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  at a glance
noverb:  the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication
active:  for it would be absurd
active:  to suppose
noverb:  powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose
active:  The walls were of wood
novoice: the floor consisted of a large iron trough
active:  I came to examine it
active:  I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it
active:  I had stooped and was scraping at this
active:  to see exactly
active:  it was
active:  I heard a muttered exclamation in German
active:  saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
active:  are you doing there
active:  he asked
active:  I felt angry
passive: having been tricked by
active:  elaborate a story as
active:  he had told me
active:  I was admiring your fuller's-earth
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  I think
active:  I should be better able
active:  to advise you as to your machine
active:  I knew
active:  the exact purpose was for
passive: it was used
noverb:  The instant
active:  I uttered the words
active:  I regretted the rashness of my speech
noverb:  His face set hard
active:  a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
noverb:  Very well
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you shall know all about the machine
active:  He took a step backward
active:  slammed the little door
active:  turned the key in the lock
active:  I rushed towards
noverb:  it
novoice: pulled at the handle
active:  it was quite secure
noverb:  ,
active:  did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves
noverb:  Hullo
active:  I yelled
noverb:  Hullo
noverb:  Colonel
active:  Let me out
noverb:  And then suddenly in the silence
active:  I heard a sound
active:  sent my heart into my mouth
active:  It was the clank of the levers and the swish
noverb:  of the leaking cylinder
active:  He had set the engine at work
active:  The lamp still stood upon the floor
active:  I had placed it
active:  examining the trough
active:  By its light I saw
active:  the black ceiling was coming down upon me
noverb:  slowly
noverb:  jerkily
active:  none knew better
noverb:  myself
noverb:  with a force
active:  must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp
active:  I threw myself
active:  screaming, against the door,
novoice: dragged with my nails at the lock
active:  I implored the colonel
active:  to let me out
active:  the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries
active:  The ceiling was only a foot
noverb:  two above my head
passive: with my hand upraised
active:  I could feel its hard
noverb:  rough surface
active:  it flashed through my mind
active:  the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in
active:  I met it
active:  If I lay on my face the weight
active:  would come upon my spine
active:  I shuddered
active:  to think of
noverb:  dreadful snap
noverb:  Easier the other way
noverb:  perhaps
noverb:  and
noverb:  had I the nerve
active:  to lie and look up at
noverb:  deadly black shadow wavering down upon me
active:  Already I was unable
active:  to stand erect
novoice: my eye caught something
active:  brought a gush of hope back to my heart
active:  I have said
noverb:  the floor
active:  ceiling were of iron
active:  the walls were of wood
active:  As I gave a last
active:  hurried glance around

active:  broadened and broadened
passive: a small panel was pushed backward
active:  For an instant I could hardly believe
active:  here was indeed a door
active:  led away from death
noverb:  The next instant
active:  I threw myself through
noverb:  lay half-fainting upon the other side
active:  The panel had closed again behind me
noverb:  the crash of the lamp
noverb:  a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal
active:  told me
noverb:  narrow had been my escape
passive: I was recalled
active:  to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist

novoice: tugged at me with her left hand
active:  she held a candle in her right
active:  It was the same good friend
noverb:  warning I had

noverb:  in a moment

noverb:  Oh
active:  do not waste the so-precious time
active:  come
noverb:  This time
noverb:  at least
noverb:  I did not scorn her advice
active:  I staggered to my feet
active:  ran with her along the corridor
noverb:  down a winding stair
active:  The latter led to another broad passage
noverb:  just
active:  we reached it
active:  we heard the sound of running feet
noverb:  the shouting of two voices
active:  one answering the other from the floor on
active:  we were
noverb:  from the one beneath
noverb:  My guide stopped and looked about her
noverb:  one
active:  is at her wit's end
noverb:  she threw open a door
active:  led into a bedroom
noverb:  through the window of
active:  the moon was shining brightly
active:  It is your only chance
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  she
active:  It is high
active:  it may be
active:  you can jump it
active:  she spoke a light
active:  sprang into view at the further end of the passage
active:  I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon
noverb:  a butcher's cleaver in the other
active:  I rushed across the bedroom
noverb:  flung open the window
novoice: looked out
noverb:  quiet and sweet
noverb:  wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight
active:  it could not be more than thirty feet down
active:  I clambered out upon the sill

active:  to jump
active:  I should have heard
novoice: passed between my saviour and the ruffian

active:  she were ill-used
noverb:  ,
noverb:  at any risks
passive: I was determined
active:  to go back to her assistance

active:  pushing his way past her
active:  she threw her arms
active:  round him
active:  tried
noverb:  to hold him back
noverb:  Fritz
noverb:  Fritz
active:  she cried in English
active:  remember your promise after the last time
active:  You said
active:  it should not be again
active:  He will be silent
noverb:  Oh
active:  he will be silent
active:  You are mad
noverb:  , Elise
active:  he shouted
noverb:  struggling
active:  to break away from her
active:  You will be the ruin of us
active:  He has seen too much
noverb:  Let me pass
active:  I say
active:  He dashed her to one side
noverb:  rushing to the window
noverb:  cut at me with his heavy weapon
noverb:  I had let myself go
active:  was hanging by the hands to the sill
noverb:  his blow fell

passive: I was shaken
novoice: not hurt by the fall

active:  I could run
noverb:  for I understood

noverb:  from being out of danger
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  however
active:  I ran
noverb:  a deadly dizziness
active:  sickness came over me
active:  I glanced down at my hand
active:  was throbbing painfully
noverb:  for the first time
noverb:  saw
passive: my thumb had been cut off
active:  the blood was pouring from my wound
active:  I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it
active:  there came a sudden
active:  buzzing in my ears
noverb:  next moment
active:  I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
noverb:  long I remained unconscious
active:  I cannot tell
active:  It must have been a very long time
active:  for the moon had sunk
active:  a bright morning was breaking
active:  I came to myself
active:  My clothes were all sodden with dew
noverb:  my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb
active:  The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure
active:  I sprang to my feet with the feeling
active:  I might hardly
active:  be safe from my pursuers
noverb:  to my astonishment
active:  I came
active:  to look
active:  round me
noverb:  neither house
active:  garden were to be seen

noverb:  just a little lower

noverb:  proved
noverb:  upon my approaching it
active:  to be the very station at
active:  I had arrived upon the previous night
active:  Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand
noverb:  all
active:  had passed
active:  during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
noverb:  Half dazed
active:  I went into the station
novoice: asked about the morning train
active:  There would be one
noverb:  to Reading in less than an hour
active:  The same porter was on duty
active:  I found
active:  had been there
active:  I arrived
active:  I inquired of him
active:  he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark
active:  The name was strange to him
noverb:  Had he observed a carriage the night
noverb:  waiting for me
noverb:  No
active:  he had not
noverb:  Was there a police-station anywhere near
active:  There was one
noverb:  about three miles off
active:  It was too far for me
active:  to go
noverb:  weak and ill
active:  I was
active:  I determined
active:  to wait
active:  I got back to town
active:  telling my story to the police
noverb:  It was a little past six
active:  I arrived
active:  I went first
noverb:  to have my wound dressed
active:  the doctor was kind enough
active:  to bring me along here
active:  I put the case into your hands
active:  shall do exactly
active:  you advise
noverb:  We
noverb:  sat in silence for some little time
active:  listening to this extraordinary narrative
novoice: Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in
active:  he placed his cuttings
active:  Here is an advertisement
active:  will interest you
active:  said he
active:  It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
active:  Listen to this
noverb:  Lost
noverb:  on the 9th inst
noverb:  Mr. Jeremiah Hayling
passive: aged twenty-six
noverb:  a hydraulic engineer

passive: has not been heard of
passive: Was dressed in
noverb:  etc
noverb:  etc
noverb:  Ha
active:  That represents the last time
active:  the colonel needed to have his machine
novoice: overhauled
active:  I fancy
noverb:  Good heavens
active:  cried my patient
active:  explains
active:  the girl said
noverb:  Undoubtedly
active:  It is quite clear
noverb:  that the colonel was a cool and desperate man
active:  was absolutely determined
active:  nothing should stand in the way of his little game
noverb:  like those out-and-out pirates
active:  will leave no survivor from a captured ship
noverb:  Well,
active:  every moment now is precious
active:  you feel equal to it
active:  we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary
active:  to starting for Eyford
noverb:  Some three hours
noverb:  afterwards
active:  we were all
noverb:  in the train together
noverb:  bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village
noverb:  There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man
noverb:  myself
active:  Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat
active:  was busy with his compasses
active:  drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
noverb:  There
active:  you are
active:  said he
passive: That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village
noverb:  The place we want must be somewhere near
noverb:  line
active:  You said ten miles
active:  I think
noverb:  sir
active:  It was an hour's good drive
noverb:  And you think
active:  they brought
active:  you back all
noverb:  way
active:  you were unconscious
active:  They must have done
active:  I have a confused memory
noverb:  too
passive: having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
active:  I cannot understand
active:  said I
active:  is
active:  they should have spared you
active:  they found
active:  you lying
active:  fainting in the garden
passive: Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties
active:  I hardly think
noverb:  likely
active:  I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
noverb:  Oh
active:  we shall soon clear up all that
active:  said Bradstreet
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have drawn my circle
active:  I only wish
active:  I knew at
noverb:  point upon it the folk
active:  we are in search
active:  are to be found
active:  I think
active:  I could lay my finger on it
active:  said Holmes quietly
noverb:  Really,
noverb:  now
active:  cried the inspector
active:  you have formed your opinion
active:  Come
noverb:  now
active:  we shall see
active:  agrees with
noverb:  you
active:  I say
active:  it is south
noverb:  , for the country is more deserted there
active:  And I say east
active:  said my patient
active:  I am for west
active:  remarked the plain-clothes man
noverb:  There are several quiet little villages up there
active:  And I am for north
active:  said I
active:  there are no hills
noverb:  there
active:  our friend says
active:  he did not notice the carriage
active:  go up any
active:  Come
active:  cried the inspector
noverb:  laughing
active:  it's a very pretty diversity of opinion
active:  We have boxed the compass among us
active:  do you give your casting vote to
active:  You are all
active:  wrong
noverb:  we can't all be
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  you can
active:  This is my point
active:  He placed his finger in the centre of the circle
active:  This is
active:  we shall find them
noverb:  the twelve-mile drive
active:  gasped Hatherley
noverb:  Six out
noverb:  six back
noverb:  Nothing simpler
active:  You say yourself
active:  the horse was fresh and glossy
active:  you got in
active:  could it be
active:  it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
noverb:  Indeed,
active:  it is a likely ruse enough
active:  observed Bradstreet thoughtfully
noverb:  Of course
active:  there can be no doubt
noverb:  as to the nature of this gang
noverb:  None at all
active:  said Holmes
active:  They are coiners
noverb:  on a large scale
active:  have used the machine
active:  to form the amalgam
active:  has taken the place of silver
active:  We have known for some time
active:  a clever gang was at work
active:  said the inspector
active:  They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand
active:  We even traced them
noverb:  Reading
active:  could get no farther
noverb:  for they had covered their traces in a way
active:  showed
active:  they were very old hands
noverb:  now
noverb:  thanks to this lucky chance
active:  I think
active:  we have got them right enough
passive: the inspector was mistaken
passive: for those criminals were not destined
active:  to fall into the hands of justice
noverb:  As we rolled into Eyford Station
active:  we saw a gigantic column of smoke
active:  streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood
noverb:  hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
noverb:  A house on fire
active:  asked Bradstreet
active:  the train steamed off again on its way
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  said the station-master
active:  When did it break out
active:  I hear
active:  it was during the night
noverb:  sir
active:  it has got worse
active:  the whole place is in a blaze
active:  house is it
noverb:  Dr. Becher's
active:  Tell me
active:  broke in the engineer
noverb:  is Dr. Becher a German
noverb:  very thin
noverb:  with a long, sharp nose
active:  The station-master laughed heartily
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  Dr. Becher is an Englishman
noverb:  there isn't a man in the parish
active:  has a better-lined waistcoat
active:  he has a gentleman
active:  staying with him
noverb:  a patient
active:  I understand
noverb:  who is a foreigner
active:  he looks as
noverb:  a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
active:  The station-master had not finished his speech
active:  we were all hastening in the direction of the fire
active:  The road topped a low hill
active:  there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us
noverb:  spouting fire at every chink
noverb:  window
noverb:  in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
active:  That's it
active:  cried Hatherley
noverb:  in intense excitement
active:  There is the gravel-drive
active:  there are the rose-bushes
active:  I lay
active:  second window is the one
active:  I jumped from
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  at least
active:  said Holmes
active:  you have had your revenge upon them
active:  There can be no question
noverb:  that it was your oil-lamp
active:  it was crushed
noverb:  in the press
noverb:  set fire to the wooden walls
noverb:  no doubt
active:  they were too excited
noverb:  in the chase after you
active:  to observe it at the time
noverb:  Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night
noverb:  I very much fear
noverb:  they are a good hundred miles off by now
active:  And Holmes' fears came to be realised
noverb:  for from that day to this no word has
passive: ever been heard
noverb:  of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman
noverb:  Early
noverb:  morning a peasant had met a cart
active:  containing several people
noverb:  some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading
noverb:  there all traces of the fugitives disappeared
novoice: even Holmes' ingenuity failed
active:  to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
active:  The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
active:  they had found within
noverb:  still
active:  discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
noverb:  About sunset
noverb:  however
active:  their efforts were at last successful
active:  they subdued the flames
noverb:  not
active:  the roof had fallen in
passive: the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin
noverb:  save some twisted cylinders
noverb:  iron piping
novoice: not a trace remained of the machinery
active:  had cost our unfortunate acquaintance
noverb:  dearly
noverb:  Large masses of nickel
passive: of tin were discovered
novoice: stored in an out-house
active:  no coins were to be found
active:  may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes
passive: have been already referred to
passive: our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot
active:  he recovered his senses
active:  might have remained forever a mystery
active:  were it not for the soft mould
noverb:  told us a very plain tale
passive: He had evidently been carried down by two persons
noverb:  one of
active:  had remarkably small feet
noverb:  the other unusually large ones
noverb:  On the whole
active:  it was most
noverb:  probable
noverb:  the silent Englishman
active:  being less bold
noverb:  less murderous
noverb:  his companion
active:  had assisted the woman
active:  to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
noverb:  Well
active:  said our engineer ruefully
active:  we took our seats
active:  to return once
noverb:  to London
active:  it has been a pretty business for me
active:  I have lost my thumb
active:  I have lost a fifty-guinea fee
active:  have I gained
noverb:  Experience
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  Indirectly it may be of value
active:  you know
active:  you have only
active:  to put it into words
active:  to gain the reputation
active:  being excellent company for the remainder of your existence

noverb:  The Lord St. Simon marriage
noverb:  its curious termination
active:  have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in
active:  the unfortunate bridegroom moves
active:  Fresh scandals have eclipsed it
active:  their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama
active:  As I have reason
active:  to believe
noverb:  however
passive: the full facts have never been revealed to the general public
active:  my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share
active:  clearing the matter up
active:  I feel
active:  no memoir of him would be complete
noverb:  without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
active:  It was a few weeks
noverb:  my own marriage
noverb:  during the days
active:  I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street
active:  he came home from an afternoon stroll

noverb:  the Jezail bullet
active:  I had brought back in one of my limbs
active:  a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
noverb:  With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another
active:  I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
passive: saturated with the news of the day
noverb:  I tossed them all aside
active:  lay listless
noverb:  watching the huge crest
noverb:  monogram upon the envelope upon the table
active:  wondering lazily
active:  my friend's noble correspondent could be
active:  Here is a very fashionable epistle
active:  I remarked
active:  he entered
noverb:  Your morning letters
active:  I remember right
active:  were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
noverb:  Yes
active:  my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety
active:  he answered
noverb:  smiling
active:  and the humbler are usually the more interesting
active:  This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses
noverb:  call upon a man
passive: to be bored
active:  to lie
active:  He broke the seal
active:  glanced over the contents
noverb:  Oh
active:  come

noverb:  No
noverb:  distinctly professional
noverb:  And from a noble client
noverb:  One of the highest in England
noverb:  My dear fellow
active:  I congratulate you
active:  I assure you
noverb:  Watson, without affectation,
active:  the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
noverb:  the interest of his case
active:  It is just possible
noverb:  , however
active:  also may not be wanting in this new investigation
active:  You have been reading the papers diligently of late
active:  have you not
active:  It looks like
noverb:  it
active:  said I ruefully
active:  pointing to a huge bundle in the corner
active:  I have had nothing else
active:  to do
active:  It is fortunate
noverb:  , for you will perhaps be able
active:  to post me up
active:  I read nothing
noverb:  the criminal news and the agony column
active:  The latter is always instructive

active:  to consult you in reference to the very painful event
active:  has occurred in connection with my wedding
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter
active:  he assures me
active:  he sees no objection to your co-operation
noverb:  he even thinks
active:  it might be of some assistance
active:  I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon
active:  should you have any other engagement at

active:  I hope
active:  you will postpone it
active:  this matter is of paramount importance
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  ST. SIMON
passive: It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions

noverb:  for something more solid
active:  I have very little difficulty
active:  finding

active:  said I
active:  for the facts are quite recent
active:  the matter struck me as remarkable
active:  I feared to refer them to you
noverb:  however
active:  I knew
active:  you had an inquiry on hand
active:  you disliked the intrusion of other matters
noverb:  Oh
active:  you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van
active:  That is quite cleared up now
noverb:  indeed
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  from the first
active:  Pray
noverb:  give me the results of your newspaper selections

noverb:  the disappearance of the bride
noverb:  the
active:  asked Holmes with a start
noverb:  The vanishing of the lady
active:  When did she vanish
noverb:  At the wedding breakfast
noverb:  Indeed
active:  This is more interesting
novoice: it promised
active:  to be
noverb:  quite dramatic
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  Yes
active:  it struck me
active:  being a little out of the common
active:  They often vanish
noverb:  the ceremony
noverb:  occasionally during the honeymoon
active:  I cannot call
active:  to mind anything quite
noverb:  prompt as this
active:  Pray
noverb:  let me have the details
active:  I warn you
active:  they are very incomplete
active:  Perhaps we may make them
noverb:  Such as they are
passive: they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday
active:  I will read to
noverb:  you
passive: It is headed
noverb:  Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
passive: The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes
active:  have taken place in connection with his wedding
noverb:  The ceremony
noverb:  as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday
active:  occurred on the previous morning
active:  it is only now
active:  it has been possible
active:  to confirm the strange rumours
active:  have been
active:  persistently floating about
noverb:  In spite of the attempts of the friends
active:  to hush the matter up
noverb:  much public attention has
passive: now been drawn to it
passive: no good purpose can be served
active:  affecting
active:  to disregard
active:  is a common subject for conversation
noverb:  The ceremony
passive: was performed at St. George's
noverb:  Hanover Square
noverb:  was a very quiet one
noverb:  no one being present save the father of the bride
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother
noverb:  sister of the bridegroom)
noverb:  Lady Alicia Whittington
active:  The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate,
passive: breakfast had been prepared
active:  It appears
passive: some little trouble was caused by a woman
passive: name has not been ascertained
active:  endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party
active:  alleging
active:  she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon
active:  It was only after a painful
noverb:  prolonged scene
passive: she was ejected by the butler and the footman
noverb:  The bride
active:  had fortunately entered the house
noverb:  this unpleasant interruption
active:  had sat down
active:  to breakfast with the rest
active:  she complained of a sudden indisposition
novoice: retired to her room
noverb:  Her prolonged absence having caused some comment
active:  her father followed her
passive: learned from her maid
active:  she had only come up to her chamber for an instant
novoice: caught up an ulster
noverb:  bonnet
novoice: hurried down to the passage
active:  One of the footmen declared
noverb:  he had seen a lady leave the house
novoice: apparelled
active:  had refused
active:  to credit
active:  it was his mistress
noverb:  , believing her
active:  to be with the company
active:  ascertaining
active:  his daughter had disappeared
noverb:  Mr. Aloysius Doran
noverb:  in conjunction with the bridegroom
novoice: put themselves in communication with the police
passive: very energetic inquiries are being made
active:  will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business
noverb:  Up to a late hour last night
noverb:  however
active:  nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady
active:  There are rumours
noverb:  of foul play in the matter
active:  it is said
active:  the police have caused the arrest of the woman
active:  had caused the original disturbance
noverb:  in the belief
passive: from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
active:  And is
noverb:  all
noverb:  Only one little item in another of the morning papers
active:  it is a suggestive one
active:  And it is
noverb:  That Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  the lady
active:  had caused the disturbance
passive: has actually been arrested
active:  It appears
active:  she was formerly a danseuse
noverb:  at the Allegro
active:  she has known the bridegroom for some years
active:  There are no further particulars
active:  the whole case is in your hands now
passive: it has been set forth in the public press
noverb:  And an exceedingly interesting case it appears
active:  to be
active:  I would not have missed it for worlds
active:  there is a ring
noverb:  at the bell, Watson,
active:  as the clock makes it a few minutes after four
active:  I have no doubt
active:  this will prove to be our noble client
active:  Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer
active:  having a witness
noverb:  only as a check to my own memory
noverb:  Lord Robert St. Simon
active:  announced our page-boy
noverb:  throwing open the door
active:  A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale
noverb:  with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth
noverb:  with the steady, well-opened eye of a man
noverb:  pleasant lot
active:  it had ever been
active:  to command
passive: to be obeyed
active:  His manner was brisk
active:  his general appearance gave an undue impression of age
noverb:  for he had a slight forward stoop
noverb:  a little bend of the knees
active:  he walked
noverb:  His hair
noverb:  too
noverb:  as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat
active:  was grizzled round the edges
noverb:  thin upon the top
noverb:  As to his dress
active:  it was careful
noverb:  to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat
noverb:  white waistcoat
noverb:  yellow gloves
noverb:  patent-leather shoes
noverb:  light-coloured gaiters
active:  He advanced slowly into the room
active:  turning his head from left to right
noverb:  swinging in his right hand the cord
active:  held his golden eyeglasses
noverb:  Good-day
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said Holmes, rising and bowing
noverb:  Pray take the basket-chair
active:  This is my friend
noverb:  colleague
noverb:  Dr. Watson
noverb:  Draw up a little to the fire
active:  we will talk this matter over
noverb:  A most painful matter to me
noverb:  as you can most readily imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: I have been cut to the quick
active:  I understand
active:  you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
active:  I presume
active:  they were hardly from the same class of society
noverb:  No
active:  I am descending
active:  I beg pardon
active:  My last client of the sort was a king
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  really
active:  I had no idea
noverb:  And
noverb:  king
noverb:  The King of Scandinavia
passive: Had
active:  he lost his wife
active:  You can understand
active:  said Holmes suavely
active:  I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
active:  I promise to
noverb:  you in yours
noverb:  Of course
noverb:  Very right! very right
noverb:  I'm sure I beg pardon
noverb:  As to my own case
active:  I am ready
noverb:  to give you any information
active:  may assist you
active:  forming an opinion
active:  Thank you
active:  I have already learned all
active:  is in the public prints
noverb:  nothing
active:  I presume
active:  I may take it as correct
noverb:  this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride
novoice: Lord St. Simon glanced over
noverb:  it
noverb:  Yes
active:  it is correct
noverb:  ,
active:  it goes
active:  it needs a great deal
active:  supplementing
active:  anyone could offer an opinion
active:  I think
active:  I may arrive at my facts most directly
active:  questioning you
active:  Pray
active:  do
active:  When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
noverb:  In San Francisco
noverb:  a year ago
active:  You were travelling in the States
noverb:  Yes
active:  Did you become engaged
noverb:  No
active:  you were on a friendly footing
passive: I was amused by her society
active:  she could see
passive: I was amused
active:  Her father is very rich
passive: He is said
active:  to be the richest man on the Pacific slope
noverb:  And
active:  did he make his money
noverb:  In mining
active:  He had nothing a few years ago
noverb:  he struck gold
active:  invested it
active:  came up by leaps and bounds
noverb:  Now,
active:  is your own impression as to the young lady's
noverb:  your wife's character
active:  The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster
novoice: stared down into the fire
active:  You see
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  said he
active:  my wife was twenty
active:  her father became a rich man
noverb:  During
active:  time
active:  she ran free in a mining camp
active:  wandered through woods
noverb:  mountains
active:  her education has come from Nature rather
noverb:  from the schoolmaster
active:  She is
active:  we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild
noverb:  free
noverb:  unfettered by any sort of traditions
active:  She is impetuous
noverb:  --volcanic
active:  I was about
active:  to say
active:  She is swift
noverb:  in making up her mind
noverb:  fearless
active:  carrying out her resolutions
noverb:  On the other hand
noverb:  I would not have given her the name
active:  I have the honour
active:  to bear
noverb:  --he gave a little stately cough--
active:  had I not thought her
active:  to be at bottom a noble woman
active:  I believe
active:  she is capable
noverb:  of heroic self-sacrifice
noverb:  anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
active:  Have you her photograph
active:  I brought this with me
active:  He opened a locket
noverb:  showed us the full face of a very lovely woman
active:  It was not a photograph
noverb:  but an ivory miniature
active:  the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair
noverb:  the large dark eyes
noverb:  the exquisite mouth
active:  Holmes gazed long
noverb:  earnestly at it
active:  he closed the locket
active:  handed it back to Lord St. Simon
active:  The young lady came to London
active:  you renewed your acquaintance
noverb:  Yes
active:  her father brought her over for this last London season
active:  I met her several times
active:  became engaged to her
active:  have
active:  now married her
active:  She brought
active:  I understand
noverb:  a considerable dowry
noverb:  A fair dowry
active:  Not more than is usual in my family
noverb:  And this
noverb:  of course
noverb:  remains to you
active:  the marriage is a fait accompli
active:  I really have made no inquiries on the subject
noverb:  Very naturally not
active:  Did you see Miss Doran on the day
noverb:  the wedding
noverb:  Yes
active:  Was she in good spirits
noverb:  Never better
active:  She kept talking of
active:  we should do in our future lives
noverb:  Indeed
active:  That is very interesting
noverb:  And on the morning of the wedding
active:  She was
noverb:  possible
noverb:  at least until after the ceremony
active:  And did you observe any change in her
noverb:  Well,
active:  to tell the truth
active:  I saw
noverb:  the first signs
active:  I had
noverb:  seen
active:  her temper was just a little sharp
noverb:  The incident however
active:  was too trivial
active:  to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
active:  Pray
noverb:  let us have it
noverb:  for all that
noverb:  Oh
active:  it is childish
active:  She dropped her bouquet
active:  we went towards the vestry
active:  She was passing the front pew at the time
noverb:  it fell over into the pew
active:  There was a moment's delay
active:  the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again
active:  it did not appear to be the worse for the fall
active:  Yet when I spoke to her of the matter
active:  she answered me abruptly
noverb:  and in the carriage
noverb:  on our way home
active:  she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
noverb:  Indeed
active:  You say
active:  there was a gentleman
noverb:  in the pew
active:  Some of the general public were present
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  It is impossible
active:  to exclude them
active:  the church is open
active:  This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  I call him a gentleman by courtesy
active:  he was quite a common-looking person
active:  I hardly noticed his appearance
active:  really I think
active:  we are wandering rather far from the point
noverb:  Lady St. Simon
novoice: returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind
active:  she had gone to
noverb:  it
active:  did
noverb:  she do on re-entering her father's house
active:  I saw her in conversation with her maid
noverb:  And
noverb:  is her maid
noverb:  Alice is her name
active:  She is an American
active:  came from California with her
noverb:  A confidential servant
noverb:  A little too much
active:  It seemed to me
active:  her mistress allowed her
active:  to take great liberties
noverb:  Still,
noverb:  of course
active:  in America they look upon these things in a different way
noverb:  long did she speak to this Alice
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  a few minutes
active:  I had something else
active:  to think of
active:  You did not overhear
active:  they said
active:  Lady St. Simon said
noverb:  something about 'jumping a claim
passive: She was accustomed
active:  to use slang of the kind
active:  I have no idea
active:  she meant
active:  American slang is very expressive sometimes
noverb:  And
active:  did your wife
active:  do
active:  she finished speaking to her maid
active:  She walked into the breakfast-room
noverb:  On your arm
noverb:  No
noverb:  alone
active:  She was very independent
noverb:  in little matters
noverb:  that
noverb:  after we had sat down for ten minutes
active:  she rose hurriedly
active:  muttered some words of apology
active:  left the room
active:  She never came back
noverb:  this maid, Alice
active:  I understand
active:  deposes
active:  she went to her room
active:  covered her bride's dress with a long ulster
noverb:  put on a bonnet
active:  went out
noverb:  Quite
active:  And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar
noverb:  a woman
active:  is now in custody
noverb:  had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  I should like a few particulars as to this young lady
noverb:  your relations to her
active:  Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders
active:  raised his eyebrows
active:  We have been on a friendly footing for some years
active:  I may say on a very friendly footing
active:  She used
active:  to be at the Allegro
active:  I have not treated her ungenerously
active:  she had no just cause of complaint against me
active:  you know
active:  women are
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Flora was a dear little thing
noverb:  exceedingly hot-headed
novoice: devotedly attached to me
noverb:  She wrote me dreadful letters
active:  she heard
active:  I was about
passive: to be married
active:  to tell the truth
noverb:  the reason
noverb:  I had the marriage celebrated
active:  quietly was
active:  I feared
active:  there might be a scandal
noverb:  in the church
active:  She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we
active:  returned
active:  she endeavoured to push her way in
active:  uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife
active:  even threatening her
active:  I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort
noverb:  I had two police fellows there in private clothes
active:  soon pushed her out again
active:  She was quiet
noverb:  when she saw
active:  there was no good
active:  making a row
active:  Did your wife hear all this
noverb:  No
active:  thank goodness
active:  she did not
active:  And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
noverb:  Yes
active:  That is
active:  Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious
active:  It is thought
active:  Flora decoyed my wife out
active:  laid some terrible trap for her
noverb:  Well,
active:  it is a possible supposition
active:  You think
noverb:  too
active:  I did not say a probable one
noverb:  you do not yourself look upon this as likely
active:  I do not think Flora
active:  would hurt a fly
noverb:  Still,
active:  jealousy is a strange transformer of characters
active:  Pray
active:  is your own theory as to
active:  took place
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I came to seek a theory
noverb:  not
active:  to propound one
noverb:  I have given you all the facts
active:  you ask me
noverb:  however
active:  I may say
active:  it has occurred to me as possible
noverb:  the excitement of this affair
noverb:  the consciousness
active:  she had made so immense a social stride
active:  had the effect
active:  causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
noverb:  In short
active:  she had become suddenly deranged
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  I consider
active:  she has turned her back
active:  I will not say upon me
noverb:  upon
noverb:  much
noverb:  many have aspired to without success
active:  I can hardly explain it in any other fashion
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  certainly
active:  is also a conceivable hypothesis
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  And now
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I think
active:  I have nearly all my data
active:  May I ask
passive: you were seated at the breakfast-table
active:  you could see out of the window
active:  We could see the other side of the road and the Park
noverb:  Quite
active:  Then I do not think
active:  I need to detain you longer
active:  I shall communicate with
noverb:  you
passive: Should
active:  you be fortunate enough
active:  to solve this problem
active:  said our client, rising
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Eh
active:  was that
active:  I say
active:  I have solved it
noverb:  Where
active:  is my wife
active:  That is a detail
active:  I shall speedily supply
active:  Lord St. Simon shook his head
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it will take wiser heads
noverb:  yours
noverb:  mine
active:  he remarked
noverb:  bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner
active:  he departed
active:  It is very good
noverb:  of Lord St. Simon
active:  to honour my head
active:  putting it on a level with his own
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  I think
active:  I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning
active:  I had formed my conclusions as to the case
active:  our client came into the room
noverb:  My dear Holmes
active:  I have notes of several similar cases
noverb:  none
active:  I remarked before
active:  were quite as prompt
active:  My whole examination served
active:  to turn my conjecture into a certainty
active:  Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing
noverb:  as
active:  you find a trout in the milk
active:  to quote Thoreau's example
active:  I have heard all
active:  you have heard
noverb:  Without
noverb:  however
noverb:  the knowledge of pre-existing cases
active:  serves me
noverb:  well
noverb:  There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back
noverb:  something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War
active:  It is one of these cases
noverb:  hullo
active:  here is Lestrade
noverb:  Good-afternoon
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard
active:  there are cigars
noverb:  in the box
passive: The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket
noverb:  cravat
active:  gave him a decidedly nautical appearance
active:  he carried a black canvas bag in his hand
active:  With a short greeting he seated himself
active:  lit the cigar
passive: had been offered to him
active:  What's up
active:  asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye
active:  You look dissatisfied
active:  And I feel dissatisfied
active:  It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case
active:  I can make
noverb:  head
noverb:  tail of the business
noverb:  Really
active:  You surprise me
novoice: ever heard of such a mixed affair
active:  Every clue seems
active:  to slip through my fingers
active:  I have been at work upon it all day
noverb:  And very wet it seems to have made you
noverb:  said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have been dragging the Serpentine
noverb:  In heaven's name
noverb:  for
noverb:  In search of the body of Lady St. Simon
active:  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair
novoice: laughed heartily
active:  Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain
active:  he asked
noverb:  do you mean
active:  you have just as good a chance
active:  finding this lady in the one as in the other
active:  Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion
active:  I suppose
active:  you know all about it
active:  he snarled
noverb:  Well,
active:  I have only just heard the facts
passive: my mind is made up
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  you think
noverb:  the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
active:  I think it very unlikely
noverb:  perhaps you will kindly explain
active:  it is
active:  we found this in it
active:  He opened his bag as he spoke
active:  tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk
noverb:  a pair of white satin shoes
noverb:  a bride's wreath
noverb:  veil
noverb:  all discoloured and soaked in water
noverb:  There
active:  said he
active:  putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile
active:  There is a little nut for you
active:  to crack
noverb:  Master Holmes
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  indeed
active:  said
noverb:  my friend
noverb:  blowing blue rings into the air
active:  You dragged them from the Serpentine
noverb:  No
noverb:  They
passive: were found
active:  floating near the margin by a park-keeper
passive: They have been identified as her clothes
novoice: it seemed to me
active:  the clothes were there
active:  the body would not be far off
noverb:  By the same brilliant reasoning
active:  every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe
active:  And pray
active:  did you hope
active:  to arrive at through this
active:  At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that you will find it difficult
active:  Are you
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  now
active:  cried Lestrade with some bitterness
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  , Holmes
active:  you are not very practical
noverb:  with your deductions and your inferences
active:  You have made two blunders in as many minutes
active:  This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar
noverb:  And
active:  In the dress is a pocket
active:  In the pocket is a card-case
active:  In the card-case is a note
active:  And here is the very note
active:  He slapped it down upon the table in front of him
active:  Listen to this
active:  You will see me
noverb:  all is ready
active:  Come at once
noverb:  F. H. M.' Now my theory all
active:  has been
passive: Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar
noverb:  she, with confederates, no doubt
active:  was responsible for her disappearance
noverb:  Here,
passive: signed with her initials
active:  is the very note
passive: was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door
active:  lured her within their reach
noverb:  Very good
noverb:  Lestrade
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  laughing
active:  You really are very fine indeed
noverb:  Let me see it
active:  He took up the paper in a listless way
noverb:  his attention
active:  became
novoice: riveted
active:  he gave a little cry of satisfaction
active:  This is indeed important
active:  said he
noverb:  Ha! you find it
noverb:  Extremely
active:  I congratulate you warmly
active:  Lestrade rose in his triumph
active:  bent his head
active:  to look
active:  he shrieked
noverb:  you
active:  looking at the wrong side
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  this is the right side
noverb:  The right side
noverb:  You're mad
noverb:  Here is the note written in pencil over here
active:  And over here is
active:  appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill
active:  interests me deeply
active:  There's nothing in it
active:  I looked at it before
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  Oct. 4th
noverb:  rooms 8s
noverb:  breakfast 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  cocktail 1s
noverb:  lunch 2s
noverb:  6d
noverb:  glass sherry
noverb:  8d
active:  I see nothing in that
noverb:  Very likely not
active:  It is most
noverb:  important
noverb:  all the same
noverb:  As to the note
active:  it is important also
noverb:  ,
active:  at least the initials are
active:  I congratulate you again
noverb:  I've wasted time enough
active:  said Lestrade
noverb:  rising
active:  I believe in hard work
noverb:  not
active:  sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
noverb:  Good-day, Mr. Holmes
active:  we shall see
active:  gets to the bottom of the matter first
active:  He gathered up the garments
novoice: thrust them into the bag
novoice: made for the door
noverb:  Just one hint to you, Lestrade
active:  drawled Holmes
noverb:  his rival vanished
noverb:  I will tell you the true solution of the matter
active:  Lady St. Simon is a myth
active:  There is not
active:  there never has been
noverb:  any such person
active:  Lestrade looked sadly at my companion
active:  he turned to me
noverb:  tapped his forehead three times
active:  shook his head solemnly
noverb:  hurried away
active:  He had hardly shut the door behind him
active:  Holmes rose
active:  to put on his overcoat
active:  There is something
noverb:  in
active:  the fellow says about outdoor work
active:  he remarked
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  I must leave you to your papers for a little
active:  It was after five o'clock
active:  Sherlock Holmes left me
novoice: I had no time
active:  to be lonely
noverb:  for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box
noverb:  This
active:  he unpacked with the help of a youth
active:  he had brought with him
active:  presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began
passive: to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany
active:  There were a couple
noverb:  of brace of cold woodcock
noverb:  a pheasant
noverb:  a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles
active:  Having laid out all these luxuries
active:  my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save
passive: the things had been paid for
passive: were ordered to this address
noverb:  Just
noverb:  nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room
passive: His features were gravely set
active:  there was a light in his eye
active:  made me think
passive: he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
active:  They have laid the supper
active:  he said
active:  rubbing his hands
active:  You seem to expect company
active:  They have laid for five
noverb:  Yes
active:  I fancy
active:  we may have some company
active:  dropping in
active:  said he
active:  I am surprised
active:  Lord St. Simon has not already arrived
noverb:  Ha
active:  I fancy
active:  I hear his step now upon the stairs
active:  It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon
active:  came bustling in
active:  dangling his glasses more vigorously
noverb:  with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
active:  My messenger reached you
active:  asked Holmes
noverb:  Yes
active:  I confess
active:  the contents startled me beyond measure
noverb:  Have you good authority for
active:  you say
noverb:  The best possible
active:  Lord St. Simon sank into a chair
active:  passed his hand over his forehead
active:  will the Duke
active:  say
active:  he murmured
active:  when he hears
passive: one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
active:  It is the purest accident
active:  I cannot allow
active:  there is any humiliation
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  you look on these things from another standpoint
active:  I fail
active:  to see
active:  anyone is
active:  to blame
active:  I can hardly see
active:  the lady could have acted
noverb:  her abrupt method
active:  doing
active:  it was undoubtedly
passive: to be regretted
active:  Having no mother
active:  she had no one
active:  to advise her at such a crisis
active:  It was a slight
noverb:  sir
noverb:  a public slight
active:  said Lord St. Simon
active:  tapping his fingers upon the table
active:  You must make allowance for this poor girl
noverb:  placed in so unprecedented a position
active:  I will make no allowance
active:  I am very angry indeed
noverb:  ,
passive: I have been shamefully used
active:  I think
active:  I heard a ring
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Yes
novoice: there are steps on the landing
active:  If I cannot persuade you
active:  to take a lenient view of the matter
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  I have brought an advocate here
active:  may be more successful
active:  He opened the door
active:  ushered in a lady and gentleman
noverb:  Lord St. Simon
active:  said he
active:  allow me
active:  to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton
noverb:  The lady
active:  I think
active:  you have already met
active:  At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat
active:  stood very erect
novoice: with his eyes cast down
passive: his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat
noverb:  a picture of offended dignity
active:  The lady had taken a quick step forward
active:  had held out her hand to him
novoice: he still refused
active:  to raise his eyes
active:  It was as well for his resolution
noverb:  perhaps
active:  for her pleading face was one
active:  it was hard
active:  to resist
noverb:  You're angry
noverb:  Robert
active:  said she
noverb:  Well,
active:  I guess
active:  you have every cause
active:  to be
noverb:  Pray make no apology to me
active:  said Lord St. Simon bitterly
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes
active:  I know
active:  I have treated you real bad
active:  I should have spoken to
noverb:  you
active:  I went
active:  I was kind
noverb:  of rattled
noverb:  from the time
active:  I saw Frank here again I just didn't know
active:  I was doing or saying
active:  I only wonder I didn't fall down
noverb:  do a faint right there
noverb:  the altar
noverb:  Perhaps,
noverb:  Mrs. Moulton
active:  you would like my friend
noverb:  me
active:  to leave the room
active:  you explain this matter
active:  I may give an opinion
active:  remarked the strange gentleman
noverb:  we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already
noverb:  For my part
active:  I should like all Europe and America
active:  to hear the rights of it
active:  He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face
noverb:  alert manner
active:  I'll tell our story right away
active:  said the lady
noverb:  Frank here
active:  I met in '84
noverb:  in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies,
active:  Pa was working a claim
passive: We were engaged to each other
noverb:  Frank
noverb:  I
active:  one day father struck a rich pocket
active:  made a pile
active:  poor Frank here had a claim
active:  petered out
active:  came to nothing
active:  The richer Pa grew
active:  the poorer was Frank
noverb:  at last Pa wouldn't hear
active:  of our engagement lasting any longer
active:  he took me away to 'Frisco
noverb:  Frank wouldn't throw up his hand
noverb:  though
noverb:  he followed me there
active:  he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it
active:  It would only have made him mad
active:  to know
active:  we just fixed it all up for ourselves
active:  Frank said
active:  he would go and make his pile
noverb:  too
noverb:  never come back
active:  to claim me
active:  he had
noverb:  Pa
active:  I promised
active:  to wait for him to the end of time
active:  pledged myself not
active:  to marry anyone else
active:  he lived
noverb:  shouldn't we be married right away
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I will feel sure of you
noverb:  and I won't claim
active:  to be your husband
active:  I come back
noverb:  Well,
active:  we talked it over
active:  he had fixed it all up
noverb:  nicely
noverb:  with a clergyman all ready in waiting
noverb:  we just did it right there
active:  and then Frank went off
active:  to seek his fortune
active:  I went back to Pa
noverb:  The next
active:  I heard of Frank was
active:  he was in Montana
active:  he went
active:  prospecting in Arizona
active:  I heard of him from New Mexico
noverb:  After
active:  came a long newspaper story about
passive: a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians
active:  there was my Frank's name
noverb:  among the killed
active:  I fainted dead away
active:  I was very sick
noverb:  for months after
active:  Pa thought
active:  I had a decline
active:  took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco
active:  Not a word of news came for a year
active:  I never doubted
active:  Frank was really dead
active:  Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco
active:  we came to London
passive: a marriage was arranged
active:  Pa was very pleased
active:  I felt all the time
active:  no man on this earth would
noverb:  take the place in my heart
passive: had been given to my poor Frank
noverb:  Still,
active:  I had married Lord St. Simon
noverb:  of course I'd have done my duty by him
noverb:  We can't command our love
active:  we can our actions
active:  I went to the altar with him with the intention
active:  to make him just as good a wife
active:  it was in me
active:  to be
active:  you may imagine
active:  I felt
noverb:  just
active:  I came to the altar rails
active:  I glanced back
active:  saw Frank standing
active:  looking at me out of the first pew
active:  I thought
active:  it was his ghost
noverb:  at first
active:  I looked again there
active:  he was still
noverb:  , with a kind of question in his eyes
noverb:  as
active:  to ask me
active:  I were glad or sorry
active:  to see him
active:  I wonder I didn't drop
active:  I know
active:  everything was turning round
active:  the words of the clergyman were just
noverb:  the buzz of a bee in my ear
noverb:  I didn't know
active:  to do
active:  Should I stop the service
active:  make a scene in the church
active:  I glanced at him again
active:  he seemed to know
active:  I was thinking
noverb:  for he raised his finger to his lips
active:  to tell me
active:  to be still
noverb:  Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was writing me a note
active:  As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him
active:  he slipped the note into my hand
noverb:  he returned me the flowers
active:  It was only a line
active:  asking me
active:  to join him
active:  he made the sign to me
active:  to do
noverb:  Of course I never doubted for a moment
active:  my first duty was now to him
active:  I determined to do just
active:  he might direct
active:  When I got back
active:  I told my maid
active:  had known him in California
active:  had always been his friend
active:  I ordered her
active:  to say nothing
active:  to get a few things
novoice: packed
noverb:  my ulster ready
active:  I know
active:  I ought
active:  to have spoken to Lord St. Simon
active:  it was dreadful
noverb:  hard
noverb:  his mother and all those great people
active:  I just made up my mind
active:  to run away
active:  explain afterwards
noverb:  I hadn't been at the table ten minutes
active:  I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road
active:  He beckoned to me
active:  began walking into the Park
active:  I slipped out
noverb:  put on my things
active:  followed him
active:  Some woman came talking something
noverb:  other about Lord St. Simon to me
novoice: seemed to me from the little
active:  I heard as
active:  he had a little secret of his own
noverb:  marriage also
active:  I managed
active:  to get away from her
active:  soon overtook Frank
active:  We got into a cab together
noverb:  away we drove to some lodgings
active:  he had taken in Gordon Square
noverb:  was my true wedding after all those years of waiting
active:  Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches
active:  had escaped
active:  came on to 'Frisco
active:  found
active:  I had given him up for dead
active:  had gone to England
noverb:  followed me there
active:  had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
active:  I saw it in a paper
active:  explained the American
active:  It gave the name
noverb:  the church
noverb:  not
active:  the lady lived
active:  we had a talk as to
active:  we should do
active:  Frank was all for openness
active:  I was so ashamed
noverb:  of it all
active:  I felt as
active:  I should like to vanish away
active:  never see any of them again
noverb:  just sending a line to Pa
noverb:  perhaps
active:  to show him
active:  I was alive
active:  It was awful
noverb:  to me
active:  to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round
noverb:  breakfast-table and waiting for me
active:  to come back
active:  So Frank took my wedding-clothes
noverb:  things
active:  made a bundle of them
passive: I should not be traced
active:  dropped them away somewhere
active:  no one could find them
active:  It is likely
active:  we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow
noverb:  only
active:  this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening
active:  he found
active:  us is more than
active:  I can think
active:  he showed us very clearly
noverb:  kindly
active:  I was wrong
noverb:  and
active:  Frank was right
active:  we should be putting ourselves in the wrong
active:  we were so secret
noverb:  he offered to give us a chance
active:  talking to Lord St. Simon alone
active:  we came right away round to his rooms at once
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Robert
active:  you have heard it all
active:  I am very sorry
noverb:  if I have given you pain
active:  I hope
active:  you do not think very meanly of me
active:  Lord St. Simon had
active:  by no means relaxed his rigid attitude
active:  had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
active:  Excuse me
active:  he said
active:  it is not my custom
active:  to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
noverb:  you won't forgive me
noverb:  You won't shake hands
active:  I go
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  certainly
noverb:  it would give you any pleasure
active:  He put out his hand
novoice: coldly grasped
active:  she extended to him
active:  I had hoped
active:  suggested Holmes
active:  you would have joined us in a friendly supper
active:  I think
noverb:  there
active:  you ask a little too much
active:  responded his Lordship
passive: I may be forced
active:  to acquiesce in these recent developments
passive: I can hardly be expected
active:  to make merry over them
active:  I think
noverb:  with your permission
active:  I will
active:  now wish you all a very good-night
active:  He included us all in a sweeping bow
novoice: stalked out of the room
active:  I trust
active:  you at least will honour me with your company
active:  said Sherlock Holmes
active:  It is always a joy
active:  to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for
active:  I am one of those
active:  believe
active:  the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children
active:  being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag
active:  shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
active:  The case has been an interesting one
active:  remarked Holmes
active:  our visitors had left us
noverb:  it serves
active:  to show very clearly
noverb:  simple the explanation may be of an affair
active:  at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable
active:  Nothing could be more natural
noverb:  the sequence of events
passive: narrated by this lady
noverb:  nothing stranger
noverb:  than the result
novoice: viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard
active:  You were not yourself at fault at all
noverb:  From the first
active:  two facts were very obvious to me
noverb:  the one
active:  the lady had been quite willing
active:  to undergo the wedding ceremony
noverb:  the other
active:  she had repented of
noverb:  it within a few minutes of returning home
active:  Obviously something had occurred during the morning
active:  to cause her
noverb:  to change her mind
active:  could that something be
active:  She could not have spoken to anyone
active:  she was out
noverb:  for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
noverb:  Had she seen someone
active:  she had
active:  it must be someone
noverb:  from America
active:  she had spent
noverb:  short a time in this country
active:  she could hardly have allowed anyone
active:  to acquire
noverb:  deep an influence over her
active:  the mere sight of him would induce her
active:  to change her plans
noverb:  completely
active:  You see
active:  we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea
active:  she might have seen an American
active:  could
novoice: this American be
active:  should he possess
noverb:  much influence over her
active:  It might be a lover
active:  it might be a husband
noverb:  Her young womanhood had
active:  I knew
passive: been spent in rough scenes
noverb:  under strange conditions
active:  So far I had got
active:  I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative
active:  When he told us of a man in a pew
noverb:  of the change in the bride's manner
noverb:  of so transparent a device
active:  obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet
noverb:  of her resort to her confidential maid
noverb:  of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping
noverb:  in miners' parlance means taking possession of
active:  another person has a prior claim to
active:  the whole situation became absolutely clear
active:  She had gone off with a man
active:  the man was
noverb:  a lover
active:  was a previous husband
novoice: the chances being in favour of the latter
noverb:  And
noverb:  in the world did you find them
active:  It might have been difficult
noverb:  friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of
noverb:  he did not himself know
active:  The initials were, of course, of the highest importance
noverb:  more valuable still was it
active:  to know
noverb:  within a week
active:  he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels
active:  did you deduce the select
noverb:  By the select prices
active:  Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels
active:  There are not many
noverb:  in London
active:  charge at
noverb:  rate
noverb:  In the second one
active:  I visited in Northumberland Avenue
active:  I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton
noverb:  an American gentleman
active:  had left only the day before
active:  looking over the entries against him
active:  I came upon the very items
active:  I had seen in the duplicate bill
active:  His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square
active:  thither I travelled
novoice: being fortunate enough
active:  to find the loving couple at home
noverb:  I ventured to give them some paternal advice
active:  to point out to them
active:  it would be better
noverb:  in every way
noverb:  they should make their position a little clearer
noverb:  both to the general public
noverb:  to Lord St. Simon in particular
active:  I invited them
noverb:  to meet him here
noverb:  as you see
noverb:  I made him keep the appointment
noverb:  with no very good result
active:  I remarked
active:  His conduct was certainly not very gracious
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  Watson
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  perhaps you would not be very gracious
active:  , after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife
noverb:  of fortune
active:  I think
active:  we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
active:  thank our stars
active:  we are never likely
active:  to find ourselves in the same position
noverb:  Draw your chair up
noverb:  hand me my violin
active:  for the only problem we have still
active:  to solve
active:  is
noverb:  to
noverb:  away these bleak autumnal evenings
noverb:  XI
noverb:  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
noverb:  Holmes
active:  said I
active:  I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street
active:  here is a madman coming along
active:  It seems rather sad
active:  his relatives should allow him
active:  to come out alone
noverb:  My friend rose lazily from his armchair
novoice: stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown
noverb:  looking over my shoulder
active:  It was a bright, crisp February morning
noverb:  the snow of the day
noverb:  still lay deep upon the ground
noverb:  shimmering brightly in the wintry sun
passive: Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic
noverb:  at
noverb:  side
noverb:  on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay
active:  it fell
passive: The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped
active:  was still dangerously slippery
active:  there were fewer passengers
noverb:  usual
noverb:  Indeed,
noverb:  from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
active:  eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
active:  He was a man
noverb:  of about fifty, tall, portly
noverb:  imposing
noverb:  with a massive
active:  strongly marked face and a commanding figure
passive: He was dressed in a sombre
noverb:  rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters
noverb:  well-cut pearl-grey trousers
active:  Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
noverb:  features
noverb:  for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
passive: is little accustomed
active:  to set any tax upon his legs
active:  he ran
active:  he jerked his hands up and down
active:  waggled his head
active:  writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
active:  on earth can be the matter with him
active:  I asked
active:  He is looking up at the numbers of the houses
active:  I believe
active:  he is coming here
active:  said Holmes
active:  rubbing his hands
noverb:  Here
noverb:  Yes
active:  I rather think
active:  he is coming to consult me professionally
active:  I think
active:  I recognise the symptoms
noverb:  Ha! did I not tell you
noverb:  As he spoke
noverb:  the man
noverb:  puffing
noverb:  blowing
noverb:  rushed at our door
novoice: pulled
novoice: at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
noverb:  A few moments later he was in our room
noverb:  still puffing
noverb:  still gesticulating
noverb:  with
active:  fixed a look of grief
noverb:  despair in his eyes
active:  our smiles
passive: were turned in an instant to horror and pity
active:  For a while he could not get his words out
active:  swayed his body
novoice: plucked at his hair
noverb:  one
passive: has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason
active:  suddenly springing to his feet
active:  he beat his head against the wall with such force
noverb:  we
noverb:  rushed upon him
active:  tore him away to the centre of the room
active:  Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair
noverb:  sitting beside him
active:  patted his hand
novoice: chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones
active:  he knew
noverb:  well
active:  to employ
active:  You have come to me
active:  to tell your story
active:  have you not
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: You are fatigued with your haste
active:  Pray wait
active:  you have recovered yourself
active:  I shall be most happy
active:  to look into any little problem
active:  you may submit to me
noverb:  The man sat for a minute
noverb:  with a heaving chest
noverb:  fighting against his emotion
active:  he passed his handkerchief over his brow
noverb:  set his lips tight
active:  turned his face towards us
noverb:  No doubt
active:  you think me mad
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I see
active:  you have had some great trouble
active:  responded Holmes
active:  God knows
novoice: I have!
noverb:  a trouble
active:  is enough
active:  to unseat my reason
noverb:  sudden
noverb:  so terrible is it
noverb:  Public disgrace I might have faced
active:  I am a man
noverb:  whose character has never yet borne a stain
active:  Private affliction also is the lot of every man
active:  the two coming together
noverb:  in so frightful a form
active:  have been enough
active:  to shake my very soul
noverb:  Besides
active:  it is not I alone
active:  The very noblest in the land may suffer
passive: some way be found out of this horrible affair
active:  Pray
active:  compose yourself, sir
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  and let me have a clear account of
active:  you are
active:  it is
active:  has befallen you
noverb:  My name
active:  answered our visitor
active:  is probably familiar to your ears
active:  I am Alexander Holder
noverb:  ,
noverb:  of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson
noverb:  of Threadneedle Street
active:  The name was indeed well known to us
active:  belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London
active:  could have happened
active:  to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass
active:  We waited
noverb:  all curiosity
noverb:  until with another effort
active:  he braced himself
active:  to tell his story
active:  I feel
active:  time is of value
active:  said he
active:  that is
active:  I hastened here
active:  the police inspector suggested
active:  I should secure your co-operation
active:  I came to Baker Street by the Underground
active:  hurried from there on foot
active:  for the cabs go slowly through this snow
active:  That is
active:  I was
noverb:  out of breath
noverb:  for
active:  I am a man
noverb:  who takes very little exercise
active:  I feel better now
active:  I will put the facts
noverb:  you as shortly
noverb:  yet
active:  I can
active:  It is
noverb:  of course
active:  well known to
noverb:  you
noverb:  in a successful banking business
novoice: much depends upon our being able
active:  to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
noverb:  the number of our depositors
noverb:  One of our most lucrative means
active:  laying out
active:  money is in the shape of loans
active:  the security is unimpeachable
active:  We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years
active:  there are many noble families to
active:  we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures
noverb:  libraries
noverb:  plate
noverb:  Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank
passive: a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks
active:  I started
active:  I saw the name
active:  for it was
noverb:  of none other than
noverb:  well
noverb:  perhaps even to you I had
active:  better say no more than
active:  it was a name
noverb:  which is a household word all over the earth
noverb:  one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England
passive: I was overwhelmed by the honour
noverb:  attempted
active:  he entered
active:  to say
active:  he plunged at once into business with the air of a man
active:  wishes
active:  to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: I have been informed
active:  you are in the habit of advancing money
active:  The firm does
active:  the security is good
active:  I answered
active:  It is absolutely essential
noverb:  to me
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I should have $50,000 at once
active:  I could, of course, borrow
noverb:  trifling a sum ten times over from my friends
noverb:  I much prefer to make it a matter of business
active:  to carry out
noverb:  business myself
noverb:  In my position
active:  you can readily understand
active:  it is unwise
active:  to place one's self under obligations
noverb:  For
noverb:  long
active:  may I ask
active:  do you want this sum
active:  I asked
active:  Next Monday I have a large sum due to me
active:  I shall
active:  most certainly repay
noverb:  you advance
noverb:  with
active:  interest
active:  you think it right
active:  to charge
active:  it is very essential
noverb:  to me
passive: the money should be paid at once
active:  I should be happy
active:  to advance it without further parley from my own private purse
active:  said
noverb:  I
active:  were it not
active:  the strain would be rather more than
active:  it could bear
active:  , on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm
active:  in justice to my partner I must insist
noverb:  even in your case
passive: every businesslike precaution should be taken
noverb:  I should much prefer to have it
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  raising up a square, black morocco case
active:  he had laid beside his chair
active:  You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
noverb:  One of the most precious public possessions of the empire
active:  said I.
noverb:  Precisely
active:  He opened the case
noverb:  there
passive: imbedded in soft
noverb:  flesh-coloured velvet
noverb:  lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
active:  he had named
active:  There are thirty-nine enormous beryls
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  the price of the gold chasing
active:  is incalculable
active:  The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum
active:  I have asked
passive: I am prepared
active:  to leave it with you as my security
active:  I took the precious case into my hands
novoice: looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
active:  You doubt its value
active:  he asked
noverb:  Not at all
noverb:  I only doubt
noverb:  The propriety of my leaving it
active:  You may set your mind at rest about that
active:  I should not dream
active:  doing
active:  so were it not absolutely certain
noverb:  that I should be able
noverb:  in four days
active:  to reclaim it
active:  It is a pure matter of form
active:  Is the security sufficient
noverb:  Ample
active:  You understand
noverb:  Mr. Holder
noverb:  I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence
active:  I have in
noverb:  you
noverb:  founded upon all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  you
active:  I rely upon
noverb:  you not only
active:  to be discreet
active:  to refrain from all gossip upon the matter
noverb:  above all
active:  to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution
active:  I need
active:  not say
passive: a great public scandal would be caused
active:  any harm were to befall it
active:  Any injury to it would be almost
noverb:  its complete loss
active:  for there are no beryls
noverb:  in the world
active:  to match these
active:  it would be impossible
active:  to replace them
active:  I leave it with you
noverb:  however, with every confidence,
active:  I shall call for
noverb:  it in person on Monday morning
active:  Seeing
active:  my client was anxious
active:  to leave
active:  I said no
active:  calling for my cashier
active:  I ordered him
active:  to pay over fifty $1000 notes
active:  When I was alone once
noverb:  however
noverb:  with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me
active:  I could not
noverb:  think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
novoice: it entailed upon me
active:  There could be no doubt
noverb:  that
active:  it was a national possession
active:  a horrible scandal would ensue
active:  any misfortune should occur to
noverb:  it
noverb:  I
novoice: already regretted
active:  having ever consented to take charge of it
noverb:  However,
active:  it was too late
active:  to alter the matter now
active:  I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
noverb:  to my work
active:  When evening came
active:  I felt
active:  it would be an imprudence
active:  to leave
noverb:  precious a thing in the office behind me
passive: Bankers' safes had been forced
noverb:  now
active:  should not mine
active:  be
noverb:  terrible would be the position in
active:  I should find myself
active:  I determined
noverb:  therefore
noverb:  for the next few days
active:  I would always carry the case backward
noverb:  forward with me
active:  it might never be really out of my reach
noverb:  With this intention
active:  I called a cab
active:  drove out to my house at Streatham
active:  carrying the jewel with me
active:  I did not breathe freely
active:  I had taken it upstairs
active:  locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
noverb:  And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you
active:  to thoroughly understand the situation
noverb:  My groom
noverb:  my page sleep out of the house
passive: may be set aside altogether
active:  I have three maid-servants
active:  have been with me a number of years
active:  absolute reliability is quite above suspicion
noverb:  Another
noverb:  Lucy Parr
noverb:  the second waiting-maid
active:  has only been in my service a few months
active:  She came with an excellent character
noverb:  however
noverb:  has always given me satisfaction
active:  She is a very pretty girl
active:  has attracted admirers
active:  have occasionally hung about the place
active:  That is the only drawback
active:  we have found to her
active:  we believe her
active:  to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
noverb:  much for the servants
noverb:  My family
active:  itself is so small
noverb:  that it will not take me long
active:  to describe it
active:  I am a widower
active:  have an only son, Arthur
active:  He has been a disappointment to me
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  a grievous disappointment
active:  I have no doubt
active:  I am myself
active:  to blame
active:  People tell me
active:  I have spoiled him
noverb:  Very likely I have
active:  When my dear wife died
active:  I felt
active:  he was all
active:  I had
active:  to love
active:  I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face
noverb:  I have never denied him a wish
active:  Perhaps it would
active:  have been better for
novoice: of us had
novoice: I been sterner
active:  I meant it for the best
active:  It was naturally my intention
noverb:  that he should succeed me in my business
active:  he was not of a business turn
active:  He was wild
noverb:  wayward
active:  to speak the truth
active:  I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money
noverb:  When
active:  he was young
active:  he became a member of an aristocratic club
noverb:  there
active:  having charming manners
active:  he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits
active:  He learned
active:  to play heavily at cards
active:  to squander money on the turf
active:  he had again
noverb:  again
active:  to come to me
active:  implore me
noverb:  to give him an advance upon his allowance
active:  he might settle his debts of honour
active:  He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company
active:  he was keeping
noverb:  each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough
active:  to draw him back again
noverb:  And,
noverb:  indeed
active:  I could not wonder
noverb:  such a man
active:  Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him
noverb:  for he has frequently brought him to my house
active:  I have found myself
active:  I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner
active:  He is older
noverb:  than Arthur
noverb:  a man of the world to his finger-tips
noverb:  one
active:  had been everywhere
noverb:  seen everything
noverb:  a brilliant talker
noverb:  a man of great personal beauty
noverb:  Yet when I think of him in cold blood
noverb:  far away from the glamour of his presence
passive: I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look
active:  I have caught in his eyes
active:  he is one
noverb:  who should be deeply distrusted
active:  So I think
noverb:  too
active:  thinks my little Mary
active:  has a woman's quick insight into character
active:  And now there is only she
passive: to be described
active:  She is my niece
active:  my brother died five years ago
active:  left her alone in the world
active:  I adopted her
active:  have looked upon her
noverb:  as my daughter
active:  She is a sunbeam
noverb:  in my house
noverb:  sweet
noverb:  loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager
noverb:  housekeeper
noverb:  yet as tender
noverb:  quiet
noverb:  gentle as a woman could be
noverb:  She is my right hand
active:  I do not know
active:  I could do without her
active:  In only one matter has she
noverb:  gone against my wishes
active:  Twice my boy has asked her
active:  to marry him
noverb:  for he loves her devotedly
noverb:  each time
active:  she has refused him
active:  I think
active:  anyone could have drawn him into the right path
active:  it would have been she
active:  his marriage might have changed his whole life
noverb:  now
noverb:  alas!
active:  it is too late
noverb:  --forever too late
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you know the people
active:  live under my roof
active:  I shall continue with my miserable story
active:  When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room
noverb:  night after dinner
active:  I told Arthur
noverb:  Mary my experience
noverb:  of the precious treasure
active:  we had under our roof
active:  suppressing only the name of my client
noverb:  Lucy Parr
active:  had brought in the coffee
active:  had
active:  I am sure
noverb:  , left the room
active:  I cannot swear
passive: the door was closed
noverb:  Mary
passive: Arthur were much interested and wished
active:  to see the famous coronet
active:  I thought it better not
active:  to disturb it
passive: Where have
active:  you put it
active:  asked Arthur
noverb:  In my own bureau
noverb:  Well,
active:  I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night
active:  said
noverb:  he
passive: It is locked up
active:  I answered
noverb:  Oh
active:  any old key will fit that bureau
active:  When I was a youngster
noverb:  I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
active:  He often had a wild way of talking
active:  I thought little of
active:  he said
active:  He followed me to my room
noverb:  however
noverb:  night with a very grave face
noverb:  Look here, dad
active:  said
active:  he with his eyes cast down
noverb:  can you let me have $200
noverb:  No
active:  I cannot
active:  I answered sharply
active:  I have been far too generous with you in money matters
active:  You have been very kind
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I must have this money
active:  else I can never show my face inside the club again
noverb:  And a very good thing
noverb:  too
active:  I cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not bear the disgrace
active:  I must raise the money in some way
noverb:  you will not let me have it
active:  I must try other means
active:  I was very angry
noverb:  , for this was the third demand during the month
active:  You shall not have a farthing from me
active:  I cried
noverb:  on
active:  he bowed and left the room without another word
passive: When he was gone
active:  I unlocked my bureau
noverb:  made sure
active:  my treasure was safe
active:  locked it again
active:  Then I started
active:  to go round the house
active:  to see
noverb:  all was secure
noverb:  a duty
active:  I usually leave to Mary
active:  I thought it well
noverb:  to perform myself that night
active:  As I came down the stairs
noverb:  I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall
active:  she closed and fastened
active:  I approached
noverb:  Tell me, dad,' said
noverb:  she
noverb:  looking
active:  I thought
noverb:  a little disturbed
active:  did you give Lucy
noverb:  the maid
noverb:  leave
active:  to go out to-night?
noverb:  Certainly not
active:  She came in just now by the back door
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she has only been to the side gate
active:  to see someone
active:  I think
active:  it is hardly safe
noverb:  and should be stopped
active:  You must speak to her in the morning
active:  I will
active:  you prefer it
active:  Are you sure
passive: everything is fastened
noverb:  Quite sure
noverb:  dad
noverb:  good-night
active:  I kissed her
active:  went up to my bedroom again
active:  I was soon asleep
noverb:  I am endeavouring to tell you everything
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  may have any bearing upon the case
active:  I beg
active:  you will question me upon any point
active:  I do not make clear
noverb:  On the contrary
active:  your statement is singularly lucid
active:  I come to a part of my story now in
active:  I should wish to be particularly
active:  I am not a very heavy sleeper
novoice: the anxiety in my mind tended
noverb:  no doubt
active:  to make me even
noverb:  usual
noverb:  About two in the morning
passive: I was awakened by some sound in the house
active:  It had ceased ere
novoice: I was wide
noverb:  awake
active:  it had left an impression behind it as
active:  a window had gently closed somewhere
active:  I lay listening with all my ears
noverb:  Suddenly,
noverb:  to my horror
active:  there was a distinct sound of footsteps
active:  moving softly in the next room
active:  I slipped out of bed
noverb:  all palpitating with fear
active:  peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
noverb:  Arthur
active:  I screamed
noverb:  you villain! you thief
active:  dare
active:  you touch that coronet
active:  The gas was half up
active:  I had left it
noverb:  my unhappy boy
passive: dressed only in his shirt
noverb:  trousers
active:  was standing beside the light
noverb:  holding the coronet in his hands
active:  He appeared
active:  to be wrenching at
noverb:  it
active:  bending it with all his strength
active:  At my cry he dropped it from his grasp
active:  turned
noverb:  death
active:  I snatched it up
active:  examined it
noverb:  One of the gold corners
noverb:  with three of the beryls in it
active:  was missing
active:  You blackguard
active:  I shouted
noverb:  beside myself with rage
active:  You have destroyed it
noverb:  You have dishonoured me forever
active:  Where are the jewels
active:  you have stolen
noverb:  Stolen
active:  he cried
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  thief
active:  I roared
active:  shaking him by the shoulder
active:  There are none
active:  missing
active:  There cannot be any missing
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  There are three
noverb:  missing
active:  And you know
active:  they are
noverb:  Must I call you a liar
noverb:  a thief
active:  Did I not see
active:  you trying to tear off another piece
active:  You have called me names enough
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I will not stand it any longer
active:  I shall not say another word about this business
active:  you have chosen to insult me
active:  I will leave your house in the morning
noverb:  make my own way in the world
active:  You shall leave it in the hands of the police
active:  I cried half-mad with grief and rage
active:  I shall have this matter
novoice: probed to the bottom
active:  You shall learn nothing from me
active:  said
noverb:  he with a passion such as I should not have thought
active:  was in his nature
active:  you choose to call the police
active:  let the police
active:  find
active:  they can
active:  By this time the whole house was astir
noverb:  for I had raised my voice in my anger
active:  Mary was the first
active:  to rush into my room
noverb:  at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face
active:  she read the whole story
noverb:  , with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground
active:  I sent the house-maid for the police
active:  put the investigation into their hands at once
noverb:  When the inspector
active:  a constable entered the house, Arthur
novoice: had stood sullenly with his arms folded
active:  asked me
active:  it was my intention
active:  to charge him with theft
active:  I answered
active:  it had ceased to be a private matter
noverb:  had become a public one
active:  the ruined coronet was national property
active:  I was determined
active:  the law should have its way in everything
noverb:  At least,
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  you will not have me arrested at once
active:  It would be to your advantage
noverb:  mine
active:  I might leave the house for five minutes
active:  you may get away
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you may conceal
active:  you have stolen
active:  said I. And
active:  realising the dreadful position in
passive: I was placed
active:  I implored him
active:  to remember
noverb:  not only my honour
noverb:  of one
noverb:  who was far greater
noverb:  than I was at stake
noverb:  and
active:  he threatened to raise a scandal
active:  would convulse the nation
active:  He might avert it all
active:  he would
active:  tell me
active:  he had done with the three missing stones
active:  You may as well face the matter
active:  said
noverb:  I
passive: you have been caught in the act
active:  no confession could make your guilt more heinous
noverb:  you
noverb:  make such reparation
active:  is in your power
active:  telling us
active:  the beryls are
noverb:  all shall be forgiven and forgotten
noverb:  Keep your forgiveness for those
active:  ask for it
active:  he answered
noverb:  turning away from me with a sneer
active:  I saw
active:  he was too hardened
noverb:  for any words of mine
active:  to influence him
active:  There was
noverb:  one way for it
active:  I called in the inspector
active:  gave him into custody
passive: A search was made at once not only of his person
noverb:  of his room
noverb:  of every portion of the house
active:  he could possibly have concealed the gems
passive: no trace of them could be found
noverb:  would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats
noverb:  This morning
passive: he was removed to a cell
noverb:  I
active:  going through all the police formalities
active:  have hurried round to you
active:  to implore you
active:  to use your skill
active:  unravelling the matter
active:  The police have openly confessed
active:  they can at present make nothing of it
active:  You may go to any expense
active:  you think necessary
active:  I have already offered a reward of $1000
noverb:  My God
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night
noverb:  Oh
active:  shall
active:  I do
active:  He put a hand on
noverb:  side of his head
active:  rocked himself to
noverb:  fro
noverb:  droning to himself
noverb:  a child
active:  grief has got beyond words
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes
noverb:  , with his brows knitted
active:  his eyes fixed upon the fire
active:  Do you receive much company
active:  he asked
active:  None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's
active:  Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately
noverb:  No one else
active:  I think
active:  Do you go out much in society
active:  Arthur does
noverb:  Mary
active:  I stay at home
noverb:  We
noverb:  of us care for it
active:  That is unusual in a young girl
active:  She is of a quiet nature
noverb:  Besides
active:  she is not
noverb:  very young
active:  She is four-and
noverb:  -twenty
noverb:  This matter
noverb:  from
active:  you say
active:  seems to have been a shock to her also
noverb:  Terrible
active:  She is even more affected
noverb:  than I.
active:  You have
noverb:  of you any doubt as to your son's guilt
active:  can we have
active:  I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
active:  I hardly consider
noverb:  a conclusive proof
active:  Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured
noverb:  Yes
passive: it was twisted
active:  Do you not think
active:  he might have been trying to straighten it
active:  God bless you
active:  You are doing
active:  you can for him
noverb:  for me
active:  it is too heavy
noverb:  a task
active:  was he doing there at all
active:  his purpose were innocent
active:  did he not say
noverb:  Precisely
noverb:  And
active:  it were guilty
noverb:  ,
active:  did he not invent a lie
active:  His silence appears to me
active:  to cut
noverb:  ways
active:  There are several singular points about the case
active:  did the police think of the noise
active:  awoke you from your sleep
active:  They considered
passive: it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door
noverb:  A likely story
noverb:  As
passive: a man bent
active:  on felony would slam his door
active:  to wake a household
active:  did they say
noverb:  of the disappearance of these gems
active:  They are still sounding the planking
active:  probing the furniture in the hope
active:  finding them
noverb:  Have they thought
active:  looking outside the house
noverb:  Yes
active:  they have shown extraordinary energy
passive: The whole garden has already been minutely examined
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  my dear sir
active:  said Holmes
active:  is it not obvious
noverb:  to you now
active:  this matter really strikes very much deeper
noverb:  you
active:  the police were at first inclined to think
novoice: It appeared to
noverb:  you
active:  to be a simple case
active:  to me it seems exceedingly complex
active:  Consider
passive: is involved by your theory
active:  You suppose
active:  your son came down from his bed
active:  went, at great risk, to your dressing-room
noverb:  opened your bureau
active:  took out your coronet
active:  broke off by main force a small portion of it
active:  went off to some other place
active:  concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine
noverb:  with such skill
active:  nobody can find them
novoice: returned with the other thirty-six into the room in
active:  he exposed himself to the greatest danger
passive: being discovered
active:  I ask you now
active:  is such a theory tenable
noverb:  other is there
active:  cried the banker with a gesture of despair
active:  his motives were innocent
active:  does he not explain them
active:  It is our task
active:  to find
noverb:  out
active:  replied Holmes
noverb:  now
noverb:  you
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  we will set off for Streatham together
active:  devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
active:  My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
active:  I was eager enough
active:  to do
passive: for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to
active:  we had listened
active:  I confess
active:  the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me
active:  to be
active:  it did to his unhappy father
active:  still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment
active:  I felt
active:  there must be some grounds
noverb:  for hope
passive: he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation
noverb:  He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb
active:  sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes
active:  sunk in the deepest thought
active:  Our client appeared
active:  to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
passive: had been presented to him
active:  he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs
noverb:  A short railway journey
active:  a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank
noverb:  the modest residence of the great financier
active:  Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone
noverb:  standing back a little from the road
noverb:  A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
noverb:  stretched down in front to two large iron gates
active:  closed the entrance
active:  On the right side was a small wooden thicket
active:  led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door
active:  forming the tradesmen's entrance
active:  On the left ran a lane
active:  led to the stables
active:  was not itself within the grounds at all
novoice: being a public
noverb:  little used
noverb:  thoroughfare
noverb:  Holmes left us standing at the door
active:  walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path
noverb:  round by the garden behind into the stable lane
active:  long was he
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I went into the dining-room
active:  waited by the fire
active:  he should return
active:  We were sitting there in silence
active:  the door opened
active:  a young lady came in
active:  She was rather above the middle height
noverb:  slim
noverb:  with dark hair
noverb:  eyes
active:  seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin
active:  I do not think
active:  I have
noverb:  seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face
noverb:  Her lips
noverb:  too
active:  were bloodless
passive: her eyes were flushed with crying
noverb:  As she swept silently into the room
active:  she impressed me with a greater sense of grief
active:  the banker had done in the morning
active:  it was the
noverb:  more striking in her
active:  she was evidently a woman of strong character
noverb:  with immense capacity for self-restraint
active:  Disregarding my presence
active:  she went straight to her uncle
active:  passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
active:  You have given orders
passive: Arthur should be liberated
active:  have you not
noverb:  dad
active:  she asked
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  my girl
passive: the matter must be probed to the bottom
active:  I am so sure
noverb:  that he is innocent
active:  You know
active:  woman's instincts are
active:  I know
active:  he has done no harm
active:  you will be sorry
noverb:  for having acted
noverb:  harshly
active:  is he silent
active:  he is innocent
active:  knows
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  he was so angry
noverb:  that you should suspect him
active:  could I help
active:  suspecting him
active:  I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
noverb:  Oh
active:  he had only picked it up
active:  to look at it
noverb:  Oh
active:  do
active:  do take my word for it
active:  he is innocent
active:  Let the matter drop
active:  say no
active:  It is so dreadful
active:  to think of our dear Arthur in prison
active:  I shall never let
active:  it drop
passive: until the gems are found
noverb:  never
noverb:  Mary
active:  Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me
noverb:  Far
active:  hushing the thing up
active:  I have brought a gentleman down from London
active:  to inquire more deeply into it
noverb:  This gentleman
active:  she asked
noverb:  facing round to me
noverb:  No
noverb:  his friend
active:  He wished us
active:  to leave him alone
active:  He is round
noverb:  in the stable lane now
noverb:  The stable lane
noverb:  She raised her dark eyebrows
active:  can he hope to find there
noverb:  Ah! this
active:  I suppose
active:  is he
active:  I trust
noverb:  sir
active:  you will succeed in proving
active:  I feel sure
active:  is the truth
active:  my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime
active:  I fully share your opinion
active:  I trust
noverb:  with you
active:  we may prove it
active:  returned Holmes
noverb:  going back to the mat
active:  to knock the snow from his shoes
active:  I believe
active:  I have the honour
active:  addressing Miss Mary Holder
noverb:  Might I ask you a question or two
active:  Pray
active:  do
noverb:  sir
active:  it may help to clear this horrible affair up
noverb:  You heard nothing yourself last night
noverb:  Nothing
active:  until my uncle here began to speak loudly
active:  I heard
active:  I came down
active:  You shut up the windows
noverb:  doors the night before
active:  Did you fasten all the windows
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Were they all fastened this morning
noverb:  Yes
active:  You have a maid
active:  has a sweetheart
active:  I think
active:  you remarked to your uncle last night
active:  she had been out
active:  to see him
noverb:  Yes
active:  she was the girl
noverb:  who waited in the drawing-room
active:  may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet
active:  I see
active:  You infer
active:  she may have gone out
active:  to tell her sweetheart
active:  the two may have planned the robbery
active:  is the good of all these vague theories
active:  cried the banker impatiently
active:  when I have told you
active:  I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands
active:  Wait a little, Mr. Holder
active:  We must come back to that
noverb:  About this girl
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  You saw her return by the kitchen door
active:  I presume
noverb:  Yes
active:  when I went
active:  to see
passive: the door was fastened for the night
active:  I met her slipping in
active:  I saw the man
noverb:  too
noverb:  in the gloom
active:  Do you know him
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  yes!
active:  he is the green-grocer
active:  brings our vegetables round
active:  His name is Francis Prosper
active:  He stood
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  to the left of the door
active:  that is to say
noverb:  farther up the path
active:  is necessary
active:  to reach the door
noverb:  Yes
active:  he did
noverb:  And
active:  he is a man
noverb:  with a wooden leg
active:  Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes
active:  you are
noverb:  a magician
active:  said she
active:  do you know that
active:  She smiled
active:  there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin
noverb:  eager face
active:  I should be very glad now
active:  to go upstairs
active:  said he
active:  I shall probably wish
active:  to go over the
noverb:  of the house again
active:  Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows
active:  I go up
active:  He walked swiftly round from one to the other
active:  pausing only at the large one
active:  looked from the hall onto the stable lane
noverb:  This
active:  he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens
active:  Now we shall go upstairs
active:  said he at last
active:  The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber
noverb:  with a grey carpet
noverb:  a large bureau
noverb:  a long mirror
active:  Holmes went to the bureau first
active:  looked hard at the lock
passive: key was used
active:  to open it
active:  he asked
noverb:  my son
active:  himself indicated
noverb:  of the cupboard of the lumber-room
noverb:  Have you it here
active:  That is it on the dressing-table
active:  Sherlock Holmes took it up
active:  opened the bureau
active:  It is a noiseless lock
active:  said he
active:  It is no wonder
noverb:  that it did not wake you
noverb:  This case
active:  I presume
active:  contains the coronet
active:  We must have a look at it
active:  He opened the case
active:  taking out the diadem
active:  he laid it upon the table
active:  It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art
active:  the thirty-six stones were the finest
active:  I have
noverb:  seen
active:  At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
active:  a corner holding three gems
passive: had been torn away
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Holmes
active:  here is the corner
active:  corresponds to
novoice: has been
noverb:  unfortunately lost
active:  Might I beg
active:  you will break it off
active:  The banker recoiled in horror
active:  I should not dream of trying
active:  said he
active:  I will
active:  Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it
noverb:  without result
active:  I feel
active:  it give a little
active:  said he
active:  I am exceptionally strong
noverb:  in the fingers
noverb:  it would take me all my time
active:  to break it
active:  An ordinary man could not do it
noverb:  Now,
active:  do you
active:  think would happen
active:  I did break it, Mr. Holder
active:  There would be a noise
noverb:  like a pistol shot
active:  Do you tell me
noverb:  all this happened within a few yards of your bed
active:  you heard nothing of it
active:  I do not know
active:  to think
active:  It is all dark to me
active:  perhaps it may grow lighter
active:  we go
noverb:  do you think
noverb:  Miss Holder
active:  I confess
noverb:  I still share my uncle's perplexity
active:  Your son had no shoes or slippers on
active:  you saw him
noverb:  He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
active:  Thank you
passive: We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry
active:  it will be entirely our own fault
active:  we do not succeed
active:  clearing the matter up
noverb:  With your permission
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  I shall
active:  now continue my investigations
active:  He went alone, at his own request, for he explained
active:  any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult
noverb:  For an hour
active:  he was at work
active:  returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features
active:  I think
active:  I have seen now all
active:  there is
active:  to see
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said he
noverb:  I can serve you best
active:  returning to my rooms
noverb:  the gems, Mr. Holmes
active:  Where are they
active:  I cannot tell
active:  The banker wrung his hands
active:  I shall never see them again
active:  he cried
noverb:  And my son
noverb:  You give me hopes
active:  My opinion is in no way altered
noverb:  , for God's sake,
active:  was this dark business
active:  was acted in my house last night
active:  you can call
active:  upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine
noverb:  ten
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to do
active:  I can to make it clearer
active:  I understand
active:  you give me carte blanche
active:  to act for
noverb:  you
novoice: provided only
active:  I get back the gems
active:  you place no limit on the sum
active:  I may draw
active:  I would give my fortune
noverb:  to have them back
noverb:  Very good
active:  I shall look into the matter between this
noverb:  Good-bye;
active:  it is just possible
noverb:  that I may have
active:  to come over here again
noverb:  evening
active:  It was obvious
noverb:  to me
active:  my companion's mind was
novoice: now made up about the case
active:  his conclusions were
active:  was more than
active:  I could even dimly imagine
noverb:  Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point
novoice: he always glided away to some other topic
noverb:  until at last I gave it over in despair
active:  It was not
noverb:  three
active:  we found ourselves in our rooms once
active:  He hurried to his chamber
novoice: was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer
novoice: With his collar turned up
noverb:  his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots
active:  he was a perfect sample of the class
active:  I think
active:  this should do
active:  said he
active:  glancing into the glass above the fireplace
active:  I only wish
active:  you could come with me
noverb:  Watson
active:  I fear
noverb:  it won't do
active:  I may be on the trail in this matter
active:  I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp
active:  I shall soon know
active:  it is
active:  I hope
active:  I may be back
noverb:  in a few hours
active:  He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
active:  sandwiched it between two rounds of bread
active:  thrusting this rude meal into his pocket
active:  he started off upon his expedition
active:  I had just finished my tea
active:  he returned
noverb:  evidently in excellent spirits
active:  swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand
active:  He chucked it down into a corner
active:  helped himself to a cup of tea
novoice: I only looked in
active:  I passed
active:  said he
active:  I am going right on
noverb:  Where to
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  to the other side of the West End
active:  It may be some time
active:  I get back
noverb:  Don't wait up for me in case
active:  I should be late
active:  are you getting on
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  Nothing
active:  to complain of
active:  I have been out to Streatham
active:  I saw
active:  you last
active:  I did not call at the house
active:  It is a very sweet little problem
active:  I would not have missed it for a good deal
noverb:  However,
active:  I must not sit gossiping here
active:  must get these disreputable clothes off
noverb:  return to my highly respectable self
active:  I could see by his manner
active:  he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
active:  his words alone would imply
active:  His eyes twinkled
active:  there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks
active:  He hastened upstairs
noverb:  a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door
active:  told me
active:  he was off once
noverb:  upon his congenial hunt
active:  I waited until midnight
active:  there was no sign of his return
active:  I retired to my room
active:  It was no uncommon thing
noverb:  for him
active:  to be away for days
noverb:  nights on end
active:  he was hot
noverb:  upon a scent
noverb:  his lateness caused me no surprise
active:  I do not know at
noverb:  hour he came in
active:  I came down
active:  to breakfast in the morning there
active:  he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other
noverb:  as fresh
noverb:  trim as possible
active:  You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson
active:  said he
active:  you remember
active:  our client has rather an early appointment this morning
active:  it is after nine now
active:  I answered
passive: I should not be surprised
active:  were he
active:  I thought
active:  I heard a ring
active:  It was
noverb:  indeed
noverb:  our friend the financier
passive: I was shocked by the change
active:  had come over him
noverb:  for his face
active:  was naturally of a broad
noverb:  massive mould
active:  was now pinched
active:  fallen in
active:  his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter
active:  He entered with a weariness and lethargy
active:  was even more painful
noverb:  his violence of the morning before
active:  he dropped heavily into the armchair
active:  I pushed forward for him
active:  I do not know
active:  I have done to be
noverb:  severely tried
active:  said he
noverb:  Only two days ago
active:  I was a happy and prosperous man
noverb:  without a care in the world
passive: Now I am left to a lonely
active:  dishonoured age
active:  One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another
active:  My niece, Mary, has deserted me
active:  Deserted you
noverb:  Yes
passive: Her bed this morning had not been slept in
active:  her room was empty
noverb:  a note for me lay upon the hall table
active:  I had said to her last night
noverb:  in sorrow and not in anger
active:  she had married my boy all might
passive: have been well with him
noverb:  Perhaps
active:  it was thoughtless
noverb:  of me
active:  to say
active:  It is to
active:  remark
active:  she refers in this note
noverb:  MY DEAREST UNCLE
active:  I feel
active:  I have brought trouble upon you
active:  I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
active:  might never have occurred
active:  I cannot
noverb:  with this thought in my mind
active:  again be happy under your roof
active:  I feel
noverb:  I must leave you forever
active:  Do not worry about my future
noverb:  for
passive: is provided for
noverb:  and,
noverb:  above all
active:  do not search for me
active:  for it will be fruitless labour
noverb:  an ill-service to me
noverb:  In life or in death
active:  I am
noverb:  your loving
noverb:  MARY
active:  could she mean by
noverb:  note
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  Do you think
active:  it points to suicide
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  nothing of the kind
active:  It is perhaps the best possible solution
active:  I trust
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  you are nearing the end of your troubles
noverb:  Ha
active:  You say
active:  You have heard something
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  you have learned something
active:  Where are the gems
noverb:  You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them
active:  I would pay ten
active:  That would be unnecessary
active:  Three thousand will cover the matter
noverb:  And
active:  there is a little reward
active:  I fancy
active:  Have you your check-book? Here is a pen
noverb:  Better make it out for $4000
active:  With a dazed face the banker made out the required check
novoice: Holmes walked over to his desk
active:  took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it
active:  threw it down upon the table
active:  With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
active:  You have it
active:  he gasped
passive: I am saved
passive: I am saved
active:  The reaction of joy was
novoice: his grief had been
active:  he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
active:  There is one other thing
active:  you owe
noverb:  Mr. Holder
active:  said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly
active:  Owe
active:  He caught up a pen
active:  Name the sum
active:  I will pay it
noverb:  No
active:  the debt is not to me
active:  You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son,
active:  has carried himself in this matter as
active:  I should be proud
active:  to see my own son
active:  do
active:  should I ever chance to have one
active:  it was not Arthur
noverb:  who took them
noverb:  I told you yesterday
noverb:  I repeat to-day
noverb:  ,
active:  it was not
active:  You are sure
noverb:  of it
noverb:  let us hurry to him at once
noverb:  to let him know
passive: the truth is known
active:  He knows it already
active:  When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him
active:  finding
noverb:  he would not tell me the story
active:  I told it to him
noverb:  on
active:  he had
active:  to confess
active:  I was right
noverb:  and
active:  to add the very few details
active:  were not
noverb:  quite clear to me
noverb:  Your news of this morning
noverb:  however
active:  may open his lips
noverb:  For heaven's sake
active:  tell me
active:  is this extraordinary mystery
active:  I will do
noverb:  I will show you the steps by
active:  I reached it
noverb:  And let me say to
noverb:  you
noverb:  first
active:  it is hardest
noverb:  for me
active:  to say
noverb:  for you
active:  to hear
active:  there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary
active:  They have
novoice: now fled together
noverb:  My Mary
noverb:  Impossible
active:  It is unfortunately more than possible
active:  it is certain
noverb:  Neither you
active:  your son knew the true character of this man
active:  you admitted him into your family circle
active:  He is one
noverb:  of the most dangerous men in England
noverb:  a ruined gambler
noverb:  an absolutely desperate villain
noverb:  a man without heart or conscience
active:  Your niece knew nothing of such men
active:  When he breathed his vows to her
active:  he had done to a hundred
noverb:  her
active:  she flattered herself
active:  she alone had touched his heart
active:  The devil knows best
active:  he said
active:  at least she became his tool
active:  was in the habit
noverb:  seeing him nearly every evening

active:  His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news
active:  he bent her to his will
active:  I have no doubt
active:  she loved you
active:  there are women
noverb:  in
active:  the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves
active:  I think
active:  she must have been one
active:  She had hardly listened to his instructions
active:  she saw you coming downstairs
noverb:  on
active:  she closed the window rapidly
noverb:  told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover
active:  was all perfectly true
active:  Your boy, Arthur, went
active:  to bed after his interview with you
active:  he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
noverb:  In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door
active:  he rose
active:  looking out
passive: was surprised
active:  to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage
active:  she disappeared into your dressing-room
passive: Petrified with astonishment
novoice: the lad slipped on some clothes
active:  waited there in the dark
active:  to see
active:  would come of this strange affair
active:  Presently she emerged from the room again
noverb:  in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
active:  she carried the precious coronet in her hands
active:  She passed down the stairs
noverb:  he
active:  thrilling with horror
active:  ran along
active:  slipped behind the curtain near your door
active:  whence he could see
novoice: passed in the hall beneath
noverb:  He saw her stealthily open the window
active:  hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom
active:  closing it once
noverb:  hurry back to her room
noverb:  passing quite close to

novoice: hid behind the curtain
active:  she was on the scene
active:  he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman
active:  he loved
noverb:  the instant
passive: she was gone
active:  he realised
active:  crushing a misfortune
active:  this would be for
noverb:  you
noverb:  all-important it was to set it right
active:  He rushed down
noverb:  just
active:  he was, in his bare feet, opened
noverb:  the window
active:  sprang out into the snow
active:  ran down the lane
active:  he could see a dark figure in the moonlight
active:  Sir George Burnwell tried
active:  to get away
novoice: Arthur caught him
active:  there was a struggle
noverb:  between them
active:  your lad tugging at one side of the coronet
noverb:  his opponent at the other
noverb:  In the scuffle
active:  your son struck Sir George
novoice: cut him over the eye
active:  something suddenly snapped
noverb:  your son
active:  finding
active:  he had the coronet in his hands
noverb:  rushed back
active:  closed the window
novoice: ascended to your room
active:  had just observed
passive: the coronet had been twisted in the struggle
active:  was endeavouring to straighten it
active:  you appeared upon the scene
noverb:  Is it possible
active:  gasped the banker
noverb:  You
active:  roused his anger
active:  calling him names at a moment
active:  he felt
active:  he had deserved your warmest thanks
active:  He could not explain the true state of affairs
active:  betraying one
noverb:  certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands
active:  He took the more chivalrous view
noverb:  however
noverb:  preserved her secret
noverb:  And
active:  was
active:  she shrieked and fainted
active:  she saw the coronet
active:  cried Mr. Holder
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  my God!
noverb:  a blind fool I have been
active:  And his asking
passive: to be allowed
active:  to go out for five minutes
active:  The dear fellow wanted
active:  to see
active:  the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle
active:  cruelly I have misjudged him
active:  When I arrived at the house
active:  continued Holmes
noverb:  I at once went very carefully round it
active:  to observe
active:  there were any traces
noverb:  in the snow
active:  might help me
active:  I knew
active:  none had fallen
noverb:  the evening before
noverb:  also
active:  there had been a strong frost
active:  to preserve impressions
active:  I passed along the tradesmen's path
noverb:  found it all trampled down
noverb:  indistinguishable
noverb:  Just beyond it
active:  however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man
active:  round impressions on one side showed
active:  he had a wooden leg
active:  I could even tell
passive: they had been disturbed
active:  for the woman had run back swiftly to the door
passive: was shown by the deep toe
noverb:  light heel marks
active:  Wooden-leg had waited a little
active:  had gone away
active:  I thought at the time
active:  this might be the maid and her sweetheart
noverb:  of
active:  you had already spoken to me
active:  inquiry showed
active:  it was
active:  I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
active:  I took to be the police
active:  I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story
passive: was written in the snow in front of me
active:  There was a double line of tracks of a booted man
noverb:  a second double line
active:  I saw
novoice: with delight belonged to a man with naked feet
active:  I was at once convinced from
active:  you had told me
active:  the latter was your son
active:  The first had walked
noverb:  ways
active:  the other had run swiftly
passive: his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot
active:  it was obvious
noverb:  that he had passed after the other
active:  I followed them up
noverb:  found they led to the hall window
active:  Boots had worn all the snow away
noverb:  waiting
active:  Then I walked to the other end
active:  was a hundred yards
noverb:  down the lane
active:  I saw
active:  Boots had faced round
passive: the snow was cut up as
active:  there had been a struggle
noverb:  finally
active:  a few drops of blood had fallen
active:  to show me
passive: I was not mistaken
active:  Boots had
active:  run down the lane
active:  another little smudge of blood showed
active:  it was he
passive: had been hurt
active:  When he came to the highroad at the other end
active:  I found
passive: the pavement had been cleared
active:  there was an end
noverb:  to
noverb:  clue
active:  entering the house
noverb:  however
active:  I examined
active:  you remember
noverb:  the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens
active:  I could at once see
active:  someone had passed out
active:  I could distinguish the outline of an instep
passive: the wet foot had been placed
active:  coming in
active:  I was
active:  beginning to be able
active:  to form an opinion as to
active:  had occurred
active:  A man had waited outside the window
active:  someone had brought the gems
passive: the deed had been overseen by your son
active:  he had pursued the thief
active:  had struggled with him
active:  they had each tugged at the coronet
active:  their united strength causing injuries
noverb:  alone could have effected
active:  He had returned with the prize
active:  had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent
noverb:  So far
active:  I was clear
active:  The question now was
noverb:  who was the man
noverb:  who was it
noverb:  brought him the coronet
active:  It is an old maxim of mine
active:  you have excluded the impossible
noverb:  remains
noverb:  however improbable
active:  must be the truth
noverb:  Now,
active:  I knew
active:  it was not you
active:  had brought it down
active:  there only remained your niece and the maids
active:  it were the maids
active:  should your son allow himself
passive: to be accused in their place
active:  There could be no possible reason
noverb:  As he loved his cousin
noverb:  however
active:  there was an excellent explanation
noverb:  why he should retain her secret
noverb:  the
active:  the secret was a disgraceful one
active:  When I remembered
active:  you had seen her at that window
active:  she had fainted
active:  seeing the coronet again
active:  my conjecture became a certainty
noverb:  And
active:  could it be
noverb:  was her confederate
noverb:  A lover evidently
noverb:  for
active:  else could outweigh the love
noverb:  gratitude
active:  she must feel to
noverb:  you
active:  I knew
active:  you went out little
active:  your circle of friends was a very limited one
active:  among them was Sir George Burnwell
active:  I had heard of him
active:  being a man of evil reputation among women
active:  It must have been he
active:  wore those boots
active:  retained the missing gems
active:  he knew
active:  Arthur had discovered him
active:  he might still
active:  flatter himself
active:  he was safe
noverb:  , for the lad could not say a word
active:  compromising his own family
noverb:  Well,
active:  your own good sense will suggest
noverb:  measures I took next
active:  I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house
novoice: managed
active:  to pick up an acquaintance with his valet
noverb:  learned
active:  his master had cut his head the night before
active:  finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure
active:  buying a pair of his cast-off shoes
noverb:  With these I journeyed down to Streatham
noverb:  saw
active:  they exactly fitted the tracks
active:  I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
active:  said Mr. Holder
noverb:  Precisely
active:  It was I. I
active:  found
active:  I had my man
active:  I came home
active:  changed my clothes
active:  It was a delicate part
active:  I had
active:  to play
noverb:  for I saw
passive: a prosecution must be avoided
active:  to avert scandal
active:  I knew
noverb:  so astute a villain would see
active:  our hands
passive: were tied in the matter
active:  I went and saw him
active:  At first, of course, he denied everything
noverb:  I gave him every particular
active:  had occurred
active:  he tried
active:  to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall
active:  I knew my man
noverb:  however
active:  I clapped a pistol to his head
active:  he could strike
active:  he became a little more reasonable
active:  I told him
noverb:  we would give him a price for the stones he held
noverb:  $1000 apiece
active:  That brought out the first signs of grief
active:  he had shown
noverb:  dash it all
active:  said
noverb:  he
noverb:  I've let them go at six hundred for the three
active:  I soon managed
active:  to get the address of the receiver
active:  had them
active:  promising him
active:  there would be no prosecution
novoice: Off I set to him
noverb:  after much chaffering
active:  I got our stones at $1000 apiece
novoice: Then I looked in upon your son
active:  told him
noverb:  all was right
active:  eventually got to my bed about two o'clock
noverb:  after
active:  I may call a really hard day's work
noverb:  A day
active:  has saved England from a great public scandal
active:  said the banker, rising
noverb:  Sir
active:  I cannot find words
active:  to thank you
active:  you shall not find me ungrateful for
active:  you have done
active:  Your skill has indeed exceeded all
active:  I have heard of
noverb:  it
active:  And now I must fly to my dear boy
active:  to apologise to him for the wrong
active:  I have done him
noverb:  As to
active:  you tell me of poor Mary
active:  it goes to my very heart
active:  Not even your skill can inform me
active:  she is now
active:  I think
active:  we may safely say
active:  returned Holmes
active:  she is
active:  Sir George Burnwell is
active:  It is equally certain
noverb:  , too
active:  her sins are
active:  they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
noverb:  XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
noverb:  To the man
noverb:  loves art for its own sake
active:  remarked Sherlock Holmes
noverb:  tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph
active:  it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations
active:  the keenest pleasure is to be derived
active:  It is pleasant
noverb:  to me
active:  to observe
noverb:  Watson
active:  you have so far grasped this truth
noverb:  in these little records of our cases
active:  you have been good enough
active:  to draw up
passive: I am bound
active:  to say
noverb:  occasionally
active:  to embellish
active:  you have given prominence not
noverb:  much to the many causes celebres
noverb:  sensational trials in
active:  I have figured
noverb:  rather to those incidents
active:  may have been trivial in themselves
active:  have given room for those faculties of deduction
noverb:  of logical synthesis
active:  I have made my special province
noverb:  And
active:  said I
noverb:  smiling
noverb:  I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism
passive: has been urged against my records
active:  You have erred
noverb:  perhaps
active:  he observed
active:  taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs
noverb:  lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe
active:  was wont
active:  to replace his clay
active:  he was in a disputatious rather
noverb:  a meditative mood
active:  you have erred perhaps
active:  attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead
active:  confining yourself to the task
active:  placing upon record
noverb:  severe reasoning from cause to effect
active:  is really the only notable feature about the thing
active:  It seems to me
active:  I have done
active:  you full justice in the matter
active:  I remarked with some coldness
noverb:  for I was repelled by the egotism
passive: I had more than once observed
active:  to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character
noverb:  No
active:  it is not selfishness
noverb:  or conceit
active:  said he
noverb:  answering
active:  was his wont
noverb:  my thoughts rather
noverb:  my words
noverb:  If I claim full justice for my art
active:  it is
active:  it is an impersonal thing
noverb:  --a thing beyond myself
active:  Crime is common
active:  Logic is rare
active:  Therefore it is upon the logic rather
noverb:  upon the crime
active:  you should dwell
active:  You have degraded
active:  should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
active:  It was a cold morning of the early spring
active:  we sat after breakfast on
noverb:  side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street
novoice: A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses
novoice: the opposing windows loomed
noverb:  dark
noverb:  shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths
passive: Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china
noverb:  metal
passive: for the table had not been cleared yet
noverb:  Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning
active:  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last
active:  having apparently given up his search
active:  he had emerged in no very sweet temper
active:  to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
noverb:  At the same time
active:  he remarked after a pause
noverb:  during
active:  he had sat puffing at his long pipe
active:  gazing down into the fire
active:  you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism
noverb:  for out of these cases
active:  you have been so kind as
active:  to interest yourself in
active:  a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all
noverb:  The small matter in
active:  I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem
novoice: connected with the man with the twisted lip
noverb:  the incident of the noble bachelor
active:  were all matters
active:  are outside the pale of the law
active:  avoiding the sensational
active:  I fear
active:  you may have bordered on the trivial
active:  The end may have been
active:  I answered
noverb:  the methods
active:  I hold to have been novel
noverb:  of interest
noverb:  Pshaw
noverb:  my dear fellow
active:  do the public
noverb:  the great unobservant public
active:  could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb
noverb:  care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction
noverb:  indeed
active:  you are trivial
active:  I cannot blame you
active:  for the days of the great cases are past
noverb:  Man
noverb:  at least criminal man
active:  has lost all enterprise and originality
noverb:  As to my own little practice
active:  it seems
active:  to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils
noverb:  giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools
active:  I think
active:  I have touched bottom at last
noverb:  however
noverb:  This note
active:  I had this morning marks my zero-point
active:  I fancy
active:  Read
noverb:  it
active:  He tossed a crumpled letter across to me
passive: It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening
active:  ran
noverb:  DEAR MR. HOLMES
active:  I am very anxious
active:  to consult you as to
active:  I should or should not accept a situation
passive: has been offered to me as governess
active:  I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow
active:  I do not inconvenience you
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  VIOLET HUNTER
active:  Do you know the young lady
active:  I asked
noverb:  Not I.
active:  It is half-past
noverb:  ten now
noverb:  Yes
active:  I have no doubt
noverb:  is her ring
active:  It may turn out
active:  to be of more interest
active:  you think
active:  You remember
noverb:  the affair of the blue carbuncle
active:  appeared to be a mere whim at first
noverb:  developed into a serious investigation
active:  It may be
noverb:  in this case
noverb:  also
noverb:  Well,
novoice: let us hope
active:  our doubts will very soon be solved, for here,
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  is the person in question
noverb:  As he spoke the door
novoice: opened
active:  a young lady entered the room
active:  She was plainly
noverb:  neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled
noverb:  a plover's egg
noverb:  with the brisk manner of a woman
active:  has had her own way
active:  to make in the world
noverb:  You will excuse my troubling you
active:  I am sure
active:  said she
noverb:  as my companion rose
active:  to greet her
active:  I have had a very strange experience
active:  I have no parents or relations of any sort from
active:  I could ask advice
active:  I thought
noverb:  perhaps
active:  you would be kind enough
active:  to tell me
active:  I should do
noverb:  Pray take a seat
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  I shall be happy
active:  to do anything
active:  I can to serve you
active:  I could see
passive: Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client
active:  He looked her over in his searching fashion
active:  composed himself
active:  with his lids drooping
noverb:  his finger-tips together
active:  to listen to her story
active:  I have been a governess for five years
active:  said she
noverb:  in the family of Colonel Spence Munro
noverb:  two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia,
active:  took his children over to America with him
active:  I found myself without a situation
active:  I advertised
active:  I answered advertisements
noverb:  without success
noverb:  At last the little money
active:  I had saved
active:  began
active:  to run short
active:  I was at my wit's end as to
active:  I should do
active:  There is a well-known agency
active:  for governesses in the West End called Westaway's
noverb:  there
active:  I used
active:  to call about once a week in order
active:  to see
active:  anything had turned up
active:  might suit me
active:  Westaway was the name of the founder of the business
passive: it is really managed by Miss Stoper
active:  She sits in her own little office
noverb:  the ladies
active:  are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
active:  are
active:  shown in one by one
active:  she consults her ledgers
noverb:  sees
active:  she has anything
active:  would suit them
noverb:  Well,
active:  I called last week
passive: I was shown into the little office as usual
active:  I found
active:  Miss Stoper was not alone
noverb:  A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin
passive: rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose
noverb:  looking very earnestly at the ladies
active:  entered
active:  As I came in
active:  he gave quite a jump in his chair
passive: turned quickly to Miss Stoper
active:  That will do
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  I could not ask for anything better
noverb:  Capital! capital
active:  He seemed quite enthusiastic
active:  rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion
active:  He was such a comfortable-looking man
active:  it was quite a pleasure
active:  to look at him
active:  You are looking for a situation, miss
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  As governess
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
noverb:  And
noverb:  salary do you ask
active:  I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  tut
noverb:  tut! sweating
noverb:  rank sweating
active:  he cried
active:  throwing his fat
active:  hands out into the air
noverb:  a man
active:  is in a boiling passion
active:  could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments
active:  My accomplishments, sir, may be less than
active:  you imagine
active:  said I. 'A little French
noverb:  , a little German
noverb:  , music
noverb:  drawing
noverb:  Tut
noverb:  tut
active:  he cried
active:  This is all quite beside the question
active:  The point is
active:  have you
noverb:  have you not the bearing
noverb:  deportment of a lady
noverb:  There
active:  it is in a nutshell
active:  you have not
passive: you are not fitted for the rearing of a child
noverb:  may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country
active:  you have
active:  could any gentleman ask you
active:  to condescend to accept anything under the three figures
active:  Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year
active:  You may imagine
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  to me
noverb:  destitute
active:  I was
novoice: such an offer seemed almost too good
active:  to be true
noverb:  The gentleman
noverb:  however
active:  seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
active:  opened a pocket-book
active:  took out a note
active:  It is also my custom
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face
active:  to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand
active:  they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe
active:  It seemed to me
active:  I had never met
noverb:  fascinating
noverb:  so thoughtful a man
active:  As I was already in debt to my tradesmen
active:  the advance was a great convenience
active:  there was something
noverb:  unnatural about the whole transaction
noverb:  made me wish
active:  to know a little
noverb:  I quite committed myself
active:  May I ask
noverb:  you live
noverb:  sir
active:  said I.
noverb:  Hampshire
noverb:  Charming rural place
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  five miles on the far side of Winchester
active:  It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house
noverb:  And my duties
noverb:  sir
active:  I should be glad
active:  to know
active:  they would be
noverb:  One child
noverb:  one dear little romper just six years old
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper
noverb:  Smack! smack! smack
active:  Three gone
active:  you could wink
active:  He leaned back in his chair
active:  laughed his eyes into his head again
active:  I was a little
novoice: startled at the nature of the child's amusement
novoice: the father's laughter made me think
active:  perhaps he was joking
noverb:  My sole duties
active:  I asked
active:  are to take charge of a single child
noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  not the sole
active:  not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried
active:  Your duty would be
active:  I am sure your good sense
active:  would suggest
active:  to obey any little commands
active:  my wife might give
novoice: provided always
active:  they were such commands
active:  a lady might with propriety obey
active:  You see no difficulty, heh
active:  I should be happy
active:  to make myself useful
noverb:  Quite
noverb:  In dress now
noverb:  for example
active:  We are faddy people
active:  you know
noverb:  faddy
noverb:  kind-hearted
passive: you were asked
active:  to wear any dress
active:  we might give you
active:  you would not object to our little whim
noverb:  Heh
noverb:  No
active:  said
noverb:  I
noverb:  considerably astonished at his words
noverb:  Or
active:  to sit here
active:  sit there
active:  that would not be offensive to you
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  no
noverb:  Or
active:  to cut your hair quite short
noverb:  before you come to us
active:  I could hardly believe my ears
noverb:  As you may observe
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  my hair is somewhat luxuriant
noverb:  of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut
active:  It has been considered artistic
active:  I could not dream
active:  sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that
active:  is quite impossible
active:  said
active:  I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes
active:  I could see a shadow
active:  pass over his face as I spoke
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that it is quite essential
noverb:  ,' said
noverb:  he
active:  It is a little fancy of my wife's
noverb:  ladies' fancies
active:  you know
noverb:  madam
passive: ladies' fancies must be consulted
noverb:  And
noverb:  you won't cut your hair
noverb:  No
noverb:  sir
active:  I really could not
active:  I answered firmly
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  very well
noverb:  quite settles the matter
active:  It is a pity
active:  in other respects
active:  you would really have done very nicely
noverb:  In
noverb:  case
noverb:  Miss Stoper
active:  I had
active:  best inspect a few
noverb:  of your young ladies
active:  The manageress had sat all this
noverb:  busy with her papers without a word to
noverb:  of us
active:  she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face
active:  I could not help
active:  suspecting
active:  she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
active:  Do you desire your name
passive: to be kept upon the books
active:  she asked
noverb:  you
noverb:  Miss Stoper
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  really
active:  it seems rather useless
active:  you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion
active:  said
noverb:  she sharply
active:  You can hardly expect us
active:  to exert ourselves
active:  to find another such opening for you
noverb:  Good-day to you, Miss Hunter
active:  She struck a gong upon the table
passive: I was shown out by the page
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
active:  I got back to my lodgings
noverb:  found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table
active:  I began to ask myself
active:  I had not done a very foolish thing
noverb:  After all
active:  these people had strange fads
noverb:  expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters
active:  they were at least ready
active:  to pay for their eccentricity
active:  Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year
noverb:  Besides
active:  use was my hair to me
passive: Many people are improved
active:  wearing
active:  it short
active:  perhaps I should be among the number
noverb:  Next day I was inclined
active:  to think
active:  I had made a mistake
noverb:  by the day after
active:  I was sure
noverb:  of it
active:  I had almost overcome my pride
active:  to go back to the agency
active:  inquire
active:  the place was still open
noverb:  I received this letter from the gentleman himself
active:  I have it here
active:  I will read it to you
noverb:  The Copper Beeches
noverb:  near Winchester
noverb:  DEAR MISS HUNTER
active:  Miss Stoper has very kindly
noverb:  given me your address
active:  I write from here
active:  to ask you
active:  you have reconsidered your decision
active:  My wife is very anxious
active:  you should come
noverb:  for she has been much
novoice: attracted by my description of you
active:  We are willing
active:  to give $30 a quarter
noverb:  $120 a year
active:  to recompense you for any little inconvenience
active:  our fads may cause you
active:  They are not very exacting
noverb:  , after all
active:  My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue
active:  would like you
active:  to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
active:  You need not
noverb:  however
active:  go to the expense
active:  purchasing one
active:  we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia)
active:  would
active:  I should think
novoice: fit you very well
noverb:  as to sitting here
noverb:  there
noverb:  amusing yourself in any manner indicated
noverb:  that need cause you no inconvenience
noverb:  As regards your hair
active:  it is no doubt
noverb:  a pity
noverb:  especially as I could not help
active:  remarking its beauty during our short interview
active:  I am afraid
noverb:  that I must remain firm upon this point
active:  I only hope
active:  the increased salary may recompense you for the loss
noverb:  Your duties
passive: the child is concerned
active:  are very light
active:  Now do try to come
active:  I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester
noverb:  Let me know your train
noverb:  Yours faithfully
noverb:  JEPHRO RUCASTLE
active:  That is the letter
active:  I have just received
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
passive: my mind is made up
active:  I will accept it
active:  I thought
noverb:  however
active:  taking the final step
active:  I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  Miss Hunter
passive: your mind is made up
active:  that settles the question
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  smiling
active:  you would not advise me
active:  to refuse
active:  I confess
active:  it is not the situation
noverb:  which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
active:  is the meaning of it all
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  Ah
active:  I have no data
active:  I cannot tell
noverb:  Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
noverb:  Well,
active:  there seems to me
active:  to be only one possible solution
active:  Mr. Rucastle seemed
active:  to be a very kind, good-natured man
active:  Is it not possible
noverb:  that his wife is a lunatic
active:  he desires to keep the matter
active:  quiet for fear
passive: she should be taken to an asylum
active:  he humours her fancies in every way in order
active:  to prevent an outbreak
active:  That is a possible solution
noverb:  in fact
noverb:  as matters stand
active:  it is the most probable one
active:  in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
noverb:  the money, Mr. Holmes, the money
noverb:  Well,
noverb:  yes
active:  of course the pay is good
noverb:  too good
active:  That is
active:  makes me uneasy
noverb:  should they give you $120 a year
active:  they could have their pick for $40
active:  There must be some strong reason behind
active:  I thought
noverb:  I told you the circumstances
active:  you would understand afterwards
active:  I wanted your help
active:  I should feel so much stronger
active:  I felt
active:  you were at the back of me
noverb:  Oh
active:  you may carry that feeling away with you
active:  I assure you
active:  your little problem promises to be the most interesting
active:  has come my way for some months
active:  There is something
noverb:  distinctly novel about some of the features
active:  you should find yourself in doubt
noverb:  in danger
noverb:  Danger
noverb:  danger do you foresee
active:  Holmes shook his head gravely
active:  It would cease to be a danger
active:  we could define it
active:  said he
noverb:  at any time, day or night
active:  a telegram would bring me down to your help
active:  That is enough
active:  She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face
active:  I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now
active:  I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once
noverb:  sacrifice my poor hair to-night
noverb:  start for Winchester to-morrow
active:  With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
noverb:  good-night
novoice: bustled off upon her way
noverb:  At least
active:  said I
active:  we heard her quick
noverb:  firm steps descending the stairs
active:  she seems to be a young lady
noverb:  who is very well able
active:  to take care of herself
active:  And she would need
active:  to be
active:  said Holmes gravely
passive: I am much mistaken
active:  we do not hear from her
active:  many days are past
active:  It was not very long
noverb:  before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
active:  A fortnight went by
noverb:  during
active:  I frequently found
active:  my thoughts turning in her direction
noverb:  wondering
noverb:  strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into
noverb:  The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal
noverb:  ,
noverb:  a fad
noverb:  a plot
active:  the man were a philanthropist or a villain
active:  it was quite beyond my powers
active:  to determine
noverb:  As to Holmes
active:  I observed
active:  he sat frequently for half an hour on end
noverb:  with knitted brows
noverb:  an abstracted air
active:  he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand
active:  I mentioned it
noverb:  Data! data! data
active:  he cried impatiently
noverb:  I can't make bricks without clay
noverb:  And
active:  he would always wind up
active:  muttering
noverb:  no sister of his should ever
active:  have accepted such a situation
noverb:  The telegram
active:  we eventually received
active:  came late one night just
active:  I was thinking
active:  turning in

passive: you are impressed by their beauty
active:  I look at them
noverb:  the only thought
active:  comes
active:  to me is a feeling of their isolation
noverb:  and of the impunity with

noverb:  Good heavens
active:  I cried
active:  would associate crime with these dear old homesteads
active:  They always fill me with a certain horror
active:  It is my belief, Watson
passive: founded upon my experience

active:  composed himself
active:  to listen
noverb:  In the first place
active:  I may say
active:  I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
active:  It is only fair
noverb:  to them
active:  to say that
active:  But I cannot understand them
active:  I am not easy
noverb:  in my mind about them
active:  can you not understand
noverb:  Their reasons for their conduct

noverb:  the reason
active:  she had left

noverb:  with the saddest look upon her face
active:  More than once I have surprised her in tears
active:  I have thought sometimes
active:  it was the disposition of her child
active:  weighed upon her mind
noverb:  for I have never met
noverb:  utterly spoiled
noverb:  so ill-natured a little creature
active:  He is small
noverb:  for his age
noverb:  with a head
active:  is quite disproportionately large
active:  His whole life appears
passive: to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals
active:  sulking
noverb:  Giving pain to any creature weaker
active:  himself seems to be his one idea of amusement
active:  he shows quite remarkable talent
active:  planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects
active:  But I would rather not talk about the creature
noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  indeed
active:  he has little

noverb:  Mr. Holmes
noverb:  curious I became as to
active:  the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be

noverb:  Dear me
noverb:  very impertinent
noverb:  Kindly turn round
noverb:  motion to him
active:  to go away
noverb:  Surely
active:  it would be better

noverb:  No
noverb:  no
noverb:  we should have him loitering here always
noverb:  Kindly turn round
active:  wave him away
noverb:  that
active:  I did

active:  seen the man in the road
active:  Pray
active:  continue
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  Your narrative promises
active:  to be a most interesting one
active:  You will find it rather disconnected
active:  I fear
active:  there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of

noverb:  On the very first day
active:  I was at the Copper Beeches
active:  Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse
noverb:  stands near the kitchen door

active:  I heard the sharp rattling of a chain
noverb:  the sound as of a large animal moving about
noverb:  Look in here
active:  said Mr. Rucastle
noverb:  showing me a slit between two planks
noverb:  Is he not a beauty
active:  I looked through

novoice: of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness

noverb:  my employer
active:  laughing at the start
active:  I had given
active:  It's only Carlo
noverb:  my mastiff
active:  I call him mine
noverb:  really old Toller

noverb:  mustard
noverb:  Toller lets him loose every night

active:  he lays his fangs upon
noverb:  For goodness' sake don't you
novoice: on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night
noverb:  for it's
active:  your life is worth
noverb:  The warning was no idle one

noverb:  the lower one locked
noverb:  I had filled the first two with my linen

active:  it was
active:  It was my coil of hair

active:  I asked
active:  do you think
active:  I lock this door
active:  I am sure
active:  I do not know
active:  It is to keep people out
noverb:  have no business there
noverb:  Do you see
active:  He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
active:  I am sure
active:  I had known
noverb:  Well,
active:  you know now
noverb:  And
noverb:  you
novoice: put your foot over that threshold again
noverb:  here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage
active:  he glared down at me with the face of a demon
active:  I'll throw you to the mastiff
active:  I was so terrified
noverb:  that I do not know
active:  I did
active:  I suppose
active:  I must have rushed past him into my room
active:  I remember nothing
active:  I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over
noverb:  Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes
active:  I could not live there longer without some advice
passive: I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child
active:  They were all horrible to me
active:  If I could only bring you down all would be well
noverb:  Of course I might have fled from the house
active:  my curiosity was almost
noverb:  my fears
passive: My mind was soon made up
noverb:  I would send you a wire
active:  I put on my hat
noverb:  cloak
active:  went down to the office
active:  is about half a mile from the house
novoice: returned
noverb:  feeling very much easier
active:  A horrible doubt came into my mind
active:  I approached the door
active:  the dog might be loose
active:  I remembered
active:  Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility
noverb:  evening
active:  I knew
noverb:  he was the only one in the household
active:  had any influence with the savage creature
noverb:  would venture to set him free
active:  I slipped in in safety
noverb:  lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought
active:  seeing you
active:  I had no difficulty
active:  getting leave
active:  to come into Winchester this morning
active:  I must be back
noverb:  before three o'clock
active:  for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit
active:  will be away all the evening
active:  I must look after the child
active:  Now I have told you
active:  all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad
active:  you could tell me
noverb:  it all means
noverb:  above all
active:  I should do
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
noverb:  My friend rose now
novoice: paced up and down the room
noverb:  his hands in his pockets
noverb:  an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
noverb:  Is Toller still drunk
active:  he asked
noverb:  Yes
active:  I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle
active:  she could do nothing with him
active:  That is well
active:  And the Rucastles go out to-night?
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  Is there a cellar with a good strong lock
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  the wine-cellar
active:  You seem to me
active:  to have acted all through this matter
noverb:  a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter
active:  Do you think
active:  you could perform one more feat
active:  I should not ask it of you
noverb:  I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
active:  I will try
active:  is it
active:  We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock
noverb:  my friend
passive: I. The Rucastles will be gone by
noverb:  time
active:  Toller will
active:  we hope
active:  be incapable
active:  There only remains Mrs. Toller
active:  might give the alarm
active:  you could send her into the cellar on some errand
noverb:  turn the key upon her
active:  you would facilitate matters immensely
active:  I will do it
noverb:  Excellent
active:  We shall
noverb:  look thoroughly into the affair
noverb:  Of course
active:  there is only one feasible explanation
active:  You have been brought there
active:  to personate someone
passive: the real person is imprisoned in this chamber
active:  That is obvious
noverb:  As to
active:  this prisoner is
active:  I have no doubt
active:  it is the daughter
noverb:  Miss Alice Rucastle
active:  I remember right
passive: was said
active:  to have gone to America
passive: You were chosen
noverb:  doubtless
active:  resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair
passive: Hers had been cut off
noverb:  very possibly in some illness through
active:  she has passed
active:  , of course, yours had to be sacrificed also
active:  By a curious chance
active:  you came upon her tresses
active:  The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--
noverb:  no doubt
active:  you wore the girl's dress
active:  were
noverb:  her
passive: he was convinced from your laughter
active:  he saw you
noverb:  afterwards from your gesture
active:  Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy
active:  she no longer desired his attentions
passive: The dog is let loose at night
active:  to prevent him
active:  endeavouring
active:  to communicate with her
active:  much is fairly clear
active:  The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
active:  on earth has
active:  to do with
noverb:  it
active:  I ejaculated
noverb:  My dear Watson
noverb:  you
active:  a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents
noverb:  Don't you see
active:  the converse is equally valid
active:  I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents
active:  studying their children
active:  This child's disposition is abnormally cruel
noverb:  merely for cruelty's sake
active:  he derives this from his smiling father
noverb:  as I should suspect
noverb:  from his mother
active:  it bodes evil for the poor girl
active:  is in their power
active:  I am sure
active:  you are right
noverb:  , Mr. Holmes
active:  cried our client
active:  A thousand things come back to me
active:  make me certain
active:  you have hit it
noverb:  Oh
noverb:  let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
active:  We must be circumspect
noverb:  , for we are dealing with a very cunning man
active:  We can do nothing until seven o'clock
active:  At that hour we shall be with
noverb:  you
active:  it will not be long
active:  we solve the mystery
active:  We were
noverb:  our word
active:  for it was just seven
noverb:  when we reached the Copper Beeches
active:  having put up our trap at a wayside public-house
noverb:  The group of trees
noverb:  with their dark leaves shining
noverb:  burnished metal in the light of the setting sun
active:  were sufficient
active:  to mark the house even
active:  had Miss Hunter not
active:  been standing smiling on the door-step
active:  Have you managed it
active:  asked Holmes
active:  A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs
active:  That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar
active:  said she
noverb:  Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug
active:  Here are his keys
active:  are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's
active:  You have done well indeed
active:  cried Holmes with enthusiasm
active:  Now lead the way
active:  we shall soon see the end of this black business
active:  We passed up the stair
active:  unlocked the door
novoice: followed on down a passage
active:  found ourselves in front of the barricade
active:  Miss Hunter had described
active:  Holmes cut the cord
active:  removed the transverse bar
active:  he tried the various keys in the lock
noverb:  without success
active:  No sound came from within
novoice: at the silence Holmes' face clouded over
active:  I trust
active:  we are not too late
active:  said he
active:  I think
noverb:  Miss Hunter
active:  we had
active:  better go in without you
noverb:  Now,
noverb:  Watson
active:  put your shoulder to it
active:  we shall see
active:  we cannot make our way in
noverb:  It was an old rickety door
active:  gave at once
noverb:  our united strength
active:  Together we rushed into the room
active:  It was empty
active:  There was no
active:  furniture save a little pallet bed
noverb:  a small table
noverb:  a basketful of linen
noverb:  The skylight
active:  was open
active:  the prisoner gone
active:  There has been some villainy here
active:  said Holmes
active:  this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions
active:  has carried his victim off
noverb:  Through the skylight
active:  We shall soon see
active:  he managed it
active:  He swung himself up onto the roof
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  yes
active:  he cried
noverb:  here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves
active:  That is
active:  he did it
active:  it is impossible
active:  said Miss Hunter
active:  the ladder was not there
active:  the Rucastles went away
active:  He has come back
active:  done it
active:  I tell you
active:  he is a clever and dangerous man
active:  I should not be very much surprised
active:  this were he
noverb:  step I hear now upon the stair
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  it would be as well for
noverb:  you
active:  to have your pistol
active:  ready
active:  The words were hardly out of his mouth
active:  a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand
novoice: Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him
active:  Sherlock Holmes sprang forward
active:  confronted him
noverb:  You villain
active:  said
noverb:  he
active:  where's your daughter
noverb:  The fat man cast his eyes round
noverb:  up at the open skylight
active:  It is for me
noverb:  to ask you that
active:  he shrieked
active:  you thieves
noverb:  Spies
noverb:  thieves
active:  I have caught you
active:  have I
active:  You are in my power
active:  I'll serve you
active:  He turned and clattered down the stairs
active:  he could go
active:  He's gone for the dog
active:  cried Miss Hunter
active:  I have my revolver
active:  said I.
noverb:  Better close the front door
active:  cried Holmes
noverb:  we all rushed down the stairs together
active:  We had hardly reached the hall
active:  we heard the baying of a hound
noverb:  a scream of agony
noverb:  with a horrible worrying sound
active:  it was dreadful
active:  to listen to
noverb:  An elderly man with a red face
active:  shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
noverb:  My God
active:  he cried
active:  Someone has loosed the dog
active:  It's
passive: not been fed for two days
noverb:  Quick,
noverb:  quick
active:  it'll be too late
noverb:  Holmes
active:  I rushed out
noverb:  round the angle of the house
noverb:  with Toller hurrying behind us
active:  There was the huge famished brute
novoice: its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat
active:  he writhed and screamed upon the ground
active:  Running up
active:  I blew its brains out
noverb:  it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck
active:  With much labour we separated them
active:  carried him
noverb:  living
noverb:  horribly mangled
noverb:  into the house
active:  We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa
active:  having dispatched the sobered Toller
active:  to bear the news to his wife
active:  I did
active:  I could to relieve his pain
active:  We were all assembled
active:  round him
active:  the door opened
active:  a tall, gaunt woman entered the room
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  cried Miss Hunter
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  miss
active:  Mr. Rucastle let me out
active:  he came back
active:  he went up to you
noverb:  Ah
noverb:  miss
noverb:  it is a pity you didn't let me know
active:  you were planning
noverb:  for I would have told you
active:  your pains
passive: were wasted
noverb:  Ha
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  looking keenly at her
active:  It is clear
active:  that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter
noverb:  anyone else
active:  Yes, sir, I do
active:  I am ready enough
active:  to tell
active:  I know
active:  pray
active:  sit down
noverb:  let us hear
active:  it for there are several points on
active:  I must confess
active:  I am still in the dark
active:  I will soon make it clear
noverb:  to you
active:  said she
active:  and I'd have done
noverb:  now
noverb:  I could ha' got out from the cellar
active:  there's police-court business over this
active:  you'll remember
active:  I was the
noverb:  one
active:  stood your friend
active:  I was Miss Alice's friend too
active:  She was never happy
noverb:  at home
noverb:  Miss Alice wasn't
noverb:  from the time
noverb:  her father married again
passive: She was slighted
active:  had no say in anything
active:  it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house
active:  I could learn
active:  Miss Alice had rights of her own
active:  will
active:  she was so quiet and patient
active:  she was
active:  she never said
noverb:  a word about them
active:  just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands
active:  He knew
active:  he was safe
noverb:  with her
active:  there was a chance of a husband coming forward
active:  would ask for all
active:  the law would give him
novoice: her father thought it time
active:  to put a stop on it
active:  He wanted her
active:  to sign a paper
active:  she married
noverb:  not
noverb:  he could use her money
noverb:  When she wouldn't do it
active:  he kept
active:  worrying her
active:  she got brain-fever
active:  for six weeks was at death's door
active:  she got better at last
noverb:  all worn to a shadow
active:  with her beautiful hair cut off
noverb:  didn't make no change in her young man
active:  he stuck to her
active:  man could be
noverb:  Ah
active:  said Holmes
active:  I think
active:  you have been good enough
noverb:  to tell us makes the matter fairly clear
noverb:  ,
active:  I can deduce all
noverb:  remains
noverb:  Mr. Rucastle
active:  I presume
active:  took to this system of imprisonment
noverb:  Yes
noverb:  sir
active:  And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order
active:  to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler
active:  That was it, sir
active:  Mr. Fowler being a persevering man
active:  as a good seaman should be
active:  blockaded the house
active:  having met
active:  you succeeded by certain arguments
noverb:  metallic
active:  convincing you
active:  your interests
active:  were the same as his
active:  Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman
active:  said Mrs. Toller serenely
noverb:  And in this way
active:  he managed
active:  your good man should have no want of drink
active:  a ladder should be ready at the moment
active:  your master had gone out
active:  You have it
noverb:  sir
noverb:  just
active:  it happened
active:  I am sure
noverb:  we owe you an apology
noverb:  Mrs. Toller
active:  said Holmes
noverb:  for you have certainly cleared up everything
active:  puzzled us
active:  And here comes the country surgeon
noverb:  Mrs. Rucastle
active:  I think
noverb:  Watson
active:  we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester
active:  it seems to me
noverb:  our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
noverb:  And
active:  was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door
active:  Mr. Rucastle survived
active:  was always a broken man
active:  kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife
active:  They still live with their old servants
active:  probably know
noverb:  much of Rucastle's past life
active:  he finds it difficult
active:  to part from them
noverb:  Mr. Fowler
passive: Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight
active:  he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius
noverb:  As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes
noverb:  rather to my disappointment
active:  manifested no further interest in her
active:  once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems
active:  she is now the head of a private school at Walsall
active:  I believe
active:  she has met with considerable success

noverb:  PREFACE
noverb:  As things now stand
noverb:  the course of instruction in American history in our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject
passive: Three separate books are used
noverb:  First,
active:  there is the primary book
active:  is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and anecdotes
noverb:  Second
active:  there is the advanced text for the seventh
noverb:  eighth grade
noverb:  generally speaking
noverb:  an expansion of the elementary book by the addition of forty or fifty thousand words
noverb:  Finally,
active:  there is the
noverb:  high school manual
noverb:  This
noverb:  too
active:  ordinarily follows the beaten path
noverb:  giving fuller accounts of the same events and characters
active:  To put it bluntly
active:  we do not assume
active:  our children obtain permanent possessions from their study of history in the lower grades
active:  mathematicians followed the same method
noverb:  high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the multiplication table and fractions
active:  There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism
novoice: advanced above
active:  It is
active:  teachers have learned from bitter experience
noverb:  little history their pupils retain as
noverb:  they pass along the regular route
active:  No teacher of history will deny this
noverb:  Still
active:  it is a standing challenge
active:  to existing methods of historical instruction
active:  the study of history cannot be made truly progressive
noverb:  the study of mathematics, science, and languages
active:  the historians assume a grave responsibility
active:  adding their subject to the already overloaded curriculum
active:  the successive historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text
noverb:  more facts
noverb:  dates
noverb:  words
active:  history deserves
noverb:  of the sharp criticism
active:  it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and economics
active:  In this condition of affairs we find our justification
active:  offering a new high school text in American history
active:  Our first contribution is one of omission
passive: The time-honored stories of exploration and the biographies of heroes are left out
active:  We frankly hold
active:  pupils know little
noverb:  nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John Smith by the time
active:  they reach the high school
active:  it is useless
active:  to tell the same stories for perhaps the fourth time
active:  It is worse
noverb:  than useless
active:  It is an offense
noverb:  against the teachers of those subjects
passive: are demonstrated
active:  to be progressive in character
active:  In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles
active:  Our reasons for this are simple
noverb:  The strategy of a campaign
active:  of a single battle is a highly technical
noverb:  usually a highly controversial
noverb:  matter about
active:  experts differ widely
noverb:  In the field of military
noverb:  naval operations most writers
active:  teachers of history are mere novices
active:  To dispose
active:  of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs
noverb:  given
noverb:  Any one
active:  compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign with the account given by Ropes, for instance,
active:  will ask for no further comment
novoice: No youth called upon
active:  to serve our country in arms
active:  would think
active:  turning to a high school manual for information about the art of warfare
noverb:  The dramatic scene or episode
noverb:  so useful
active:  arousing the interest of the immature pupil
active:  seems out of place in a book
active:  deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's serious responsibilities
active:  It is not upon negative features
noverb:  however
active:  we rest our case
active:  It is rather upon constructive features
noverb:  _First
noverb:  _ We have written a topical
noverb:  not a narrative
noverb:  history
active:  We have tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of each period
active:  bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration
noverb:  _Second
noverb:  _ We have emphasized those historical topics
active:  help to explain
active:  our nation has come to be
active:  it is to-day
noverb:  _Third
noverb:  _ We have dwelt fully upon the social
noverb:  economic aspects of our history
noverb:  especially in relation to the politics of each period
noverb:  _Fourth
noverb:  _ We have treated the causes and results of wars
noverb:  the problems
active:  financing and sustaining armed forces
noverb:  rather
noverb:  military strategy
noverb:  These are the subjects
active:  belong to a history for civilians
noverb:  These are matters
active:  civilians can understand
noverb:  matters
active:  they must understand
active:  they are
noverb:  to play well their part in war and peace
noverb:  _Fifth
noverb:  _
active:  omitting the period of exploration
active:  we have been able
active:  to enlarge the treatment of our own time
active:  We have given special attention to the history of those current questions
active:  must form the subject matter of sound instruction in citizenship
noverb:  _Sixth
noverb:  _ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique characteristics,
active:  is a part of a general civilization
active:  Accordingly we have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations
noverb:  the reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place
noverb:  _Seventh
noverb:  _ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity
noverb:  The study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory
active:  We have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association, reflection, and generalization
novoice: habits calculated
active:  to enlarge
active:  inform the mind
active:  We have been at great pains
active:  to make our text clear
noverb:  , simple
noverb:  direct
active:  we have earnestly sought to stretch the intellects of our readers
active:  to put them upon their mettle
active:  of them will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school
active:  The world will soon expect maturity from them
active:  Their achievements will depend upon the possession of other powers
noverb:  memory alone
passive: The effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by the excellence of their judgment
noverb:  the fullness of their information
