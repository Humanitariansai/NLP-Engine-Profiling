# Bi-Weekly Update: 2025-07-31

## Week 5 (2025-07-16 to 2025-07-22)
**Summary of work completed:**
- Profiled with different sample texts and finalized Intel VTune as preferred profiler
- Set up and tried out Intel VTune on nlp-engine for large text inputs
- Setup Intel VTune for hardware-less sampling for memory profiling
- Team discussion about parse-en-us not generating parse tree
- Additional inputs to vary sizes of text files to parse to analyzers

**Challenges encountered and solutions:**
- Some issues with output tree generation for parse-en-us (not resolved)

**Hours contributed:**
- 21 hours

## Week 6 (2025-07-23 to 2025-08-01)
**Summary of work completed:**
- Investigated initial performance hotspots identified by VTune
- More profiling with Intel VTune for different analyzers and texts
- Investigated codebase based on VTune results to find parse-en-us issue

**Challenges encountered and solutions:**
- Performance hotspot analysis required deeper codebase investigation; addressed by focused profiling and code review
- Continued troubleshooting of parse-en-us issue

**Hours contributed:**
- 21 hours
